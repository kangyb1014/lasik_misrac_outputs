  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for analyzing MISRA C pointer-const requirements:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (complete definition): The rule concerns pointer declarations in the structure. We must know the exact declaration and types of members used here (c->write_buffer, write_buffer_size, write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset, pool). In particular, the type of write_buffer (void * vs const void *) and any existing const qualifiers determine whether this function violates the rule.\n\n- struct MemoryPool (complete definition): The pool type may influence the prototypes of pool helper functions and whether pool operations demand mutable buffers or accept const pointers; its definition/context can also show intended mutability semantics.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free (prototype): Used here to obtain free space; its signature (especially const on the pool parameter) documents intended constness of pool operations and helps determine whether pool APIs require mutable pool state only (affects const correctness reasoning).\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate (prototype): Critical \u2014 this function is called with the write_buffer pointer and returns a (non-const) void*. Its parameter types (void * vs const void *) and return type determine whether passing a const-qualified pointer would be allowed. If the API requires a non-const pointer, write_buffer cannot be const. We need the exact prototype to judge compliance.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (prototype): Appears in an assert checking resizability of the existing buffer. Its parameter types indicate whether it accepts const buffer pointers; that affects whether write_buffer could be const.\n\n- buffer_append (prototype/definition): This function is invoked elsewhere (e.g., by build_header_response) and probably writes data into the write buffer. We must inspect its signature and implementation to see whether it modifies the buffer contents \u2014 if so, write_buffer must be a pointer-to-non-const and the target function is not violating MISRA by using void *.\n\n- try_ready_chunked_body (prototype/definition): Appears in the call-graph and may manipulate write buffers or pass pointers to APIs that require mutable buffers. Inspecting it reveals whether write_buffer contents are modified elsewhere.\n\n- try_grow_read_buffer (prototype/definition): Similarly may call pool reallocation or manipulate buffers; needed to see patterns of mutability and whether buffers are treated as mutable.\n\n- connection_shrink_read_buffer (prototype/definition): Another buffer-manipulating routine; its behavior and signatures reveal whether buffer pointers are expected to be mutable.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_read (prototype/definition): May read into or reallocate buffers; check whether it treats write_buffer (or analogous buffers) as mutable.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (prototype/definition): Allocator wrapper used elsewhere; its API shows whether allocations/reallocations are meant to return mutable pointers (affecting whether stored pointers should be const-qualified).\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/definition): Although not directly about const qualification, asserts in the function check assumptions about pointer equality and API behavior; knowing its definition can be relevant if it casts pointers or affects type checking in builds.\n\nRationale summary: To decide if write_buffer (and related pointers) should be const-qualified under MISRA, we must know the declared types (struct members and pool API prototypes) and all places that write to or reallocate the buffer. If any API or code path requires a mutable (non-const) pointer or writes into the buffer contents, then making the pointer const would be incorrect. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to determine those facts."
