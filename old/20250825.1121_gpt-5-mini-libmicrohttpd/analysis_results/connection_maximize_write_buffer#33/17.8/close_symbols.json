  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: needed to determine whether the code modifies the parameter variable 'connection' or only the object it points to (which MISRA allows). You must see the member types/names (write_buffer, write_buffer_size, write_buffer_send_offset, write_buffer_append_offset) to confirm they are object fields, not aliases to the parameter itself. Also verify any constness on members.  \n- struct MemoryPool: the pool type is passed into allocator calls; its definition may show if allocator functions take/modify pool or connection internals.  \n- MHD_pool_get_free: the prototype and documentation/side-effects are required to confirm it does not modify the pointer parameter (e.g. via side effects) and to know whether calling it could implicitly alter 'connection' or its contents.  \n- MHD_pool_reallocate: must inspect its prototype and semantics (parameters and return value) to ensure it does not take a pointer-to-pointer or otherwise modify the function parameter 'connection'. You must also confirm its return semantics (it returns a new buffer pointer which is stored in c->write_buffer) so that only the pointed-to object is changed.  \n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: used in an assertion; its prototype/semantics are needed to ensure the assert condition does not have side effects that modify the parameter.  \n- mhd_assert: the assert macro/function definition is needed to confirm it has no side effects (it should not modify 'connection' or any of its members when invoked or when expanded away).  \nThese symbols let you determine whether any assignment or side-effect in this function (or in called helpers used here) modifies the pointer parameter itself (disallowed) versus modifying the object pointed to (allowed by MISRA)."
