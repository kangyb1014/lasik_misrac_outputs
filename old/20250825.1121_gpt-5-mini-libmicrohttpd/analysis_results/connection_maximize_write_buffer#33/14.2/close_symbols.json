Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "For a correct MISRA for-loop analysis we must inspect any code that could introduce or affect for loops reachable from the target function or that could expand into loop constructs via macros. Explanations:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The target function reads and updates fields of this struct (write_buffer, write_buffer_size, write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset, pool). We need the struct definition to confirm these members are ordinary scalar/pointer objects (not e.g. macros, bitfields, volatile special objects or complex types) and to see their types and qualifiers \u2014 this impacts whether they can legally appear in for-loop clauses and whether they might be modified implicitly.\n\n- struct MemoryPool: The pool object is passed to pool functions; its definition may reveal if operations on it have side effects or special concurrency/volatile semantics that affect loop-formedness reasoning.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: This callee is invoked from the target function. Although the target function contains no for loop itself, any for loops inside called functions could be relevant if those loops are executed as part of the target\u2019s behaviour. We need the implementation to check for any for loops and whether they satisfy the MISRA for-loop clauses.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: Same rationale as MHD_pool_get_free. The reallocate implementation may contain for loops or side effects that would be relevant to determine compliance; we must inspect its code.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: Used inside an assertion. The macro/function could contain for loops or side effects when expanded/called; include its definition to be sure it does not introduce ill-formed for loops or side effects that violate MISRA rules.\n\n- mhd_assert: This macro expands inline and could (in some projects) expand to code that contains loops or other statements. We must inspect the macro expansion to ensure it does not introduce any for loops or illegal modifications of loop counters when used in this function.\n\n- NULL: Although unlikely to affect for-loop well-formedness, we list NULL to ensure there are no non-standard definitions/macros that could expand to expressions containing loops or side effects (defensive check).\n\nIf the implementations/definitions above contain no for loops, or any for loops they contain are well\u2011formed per MISRA, then the target function itself (which contains no for statement) cannot violate the MISRA for-loop rule. Conversely, if any of these symbols expand/contain ill\u2011formed for loops, those violations must be attributed to those definitions and considered when assessing the target function's overall compliance (because the behaviour of a for-loop body includes the behaviour of called functions and expanded macros)."
