  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Connection (fields: pool, write_buffer, write_buffer_size, write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset): The function's controlling expressions reference these fields directly (asserts, the inner if, and the return). To determine whether those expressions are invariant you must know the fields' declarations, types, initialisation and whether they can be modified elsewhere (e.g. by other functions or threads).  \n2) struct MemoryPool: The pool pointer is passed to pool helper functions; the semantics and state of the MemoryPool determine whether MHD_pool_get_free can return a constant/invariant value and whether pool operations have side effects that could change later control-flow.  \n3) MHD_pool_get_free: This function produces free_size used in the if (0 != free_size). You must know its prototype and semantics (does it return a runtime-dependent value, can it always return 0 for a given pool, any caching/side\u2011effects) to decide if the controlling expression is invariant.  \n4) MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: Appears in an assert controlling expression. Knowing its semantics (pure function vs. depends on pool state) is needed to judge whether that assert's expression can be invariant.  \n5) MHD_pool_reallocate: Called inside the conditional and used in an assert comparing pointers. Its semantics (whether it can move the buffer, when it can fail, side effects on pool state) affect whether related conditions are constant or can change.  \n6) mhd_assert (macro/implementation): The code uses mhd_assert with boolean expressions. MISRA's rule targets controlling expressions; whether asserts are active or compiled out (and whether they are treated as control statements) affects whether these expressions count as problematic. You need the definition to know if these are runtime checks or removed.  \n7) Concurrency/locking/volatile qualifiers for MHD_Connection and MemoryPool: If any of the fields or pool state are volatile or may be modified concurrently (by other threads/callbacks), expressions that look invariant in single-threaded local analysis might actually vary at runtime. The concurrency contract (locks, atomicity, ISR/thread access) is required to conclude invariance under MISRA.  \nCollectively these symbols and contracts let an analyst determine whether each controlling expression in connection_maximize_write_buffer can be considered invariant (compile- or run-time constant) or is legitimately variant, and therefore whether the MISRA C rule is violated."
