  "explanation": "List and why they are required to decide possible violations of the <string.h> bounds rule:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - Provides types of the fields used (write_buffer pointer, write_buffer_size, write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset, pool). You must verify the invariants/semantics of these fields (ranges, whether offsets are always <= size, whether NULL is a valid write_buffer) to reason about any memory copy/move sizes and bounds.\n\n- struct MemoryPool\n  - Gives the internal layout and allocation policy of the pool object. The pool implementation determines how reallocation/copying is performed (in-place grow vs allocate-and-copy), and whether any internal routines call memcpy/memmove and with which length parameters.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free\n  - You need its prototype and semantic contract (what free bytes it returns, whether it can overflow, units) because connection_maximize_write_buffer uses its result to compute new_size = old + free_size. To determine if any subsequent memory operations (in pool reallocate) are invoked with correct sizes, you must know what free_size can be and whether new_size can wrap/overflow.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate (including its implementation/behavior)\n  - This is the critical symbol: its implementation determines whether any string.h functions (memcpy/memmove/etc.) are called, what source/destination pointers and length arguments are used, and whether the lengths are bounded by the supplied old_size/new_size arguments. You must inspect its code to ensure memcpy/memmove calls do not access beyond the bounds of the provided pointers (especially when write_buffer is NULL, when reallocating in place, or when moving data).\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace\n  - The target function asserts (via this predicate) that when write_buffer != NULL the pool can be resized in-place. Understanding what this predicate guarantees lets you determine whether MHD_pool_reallocate will be required to move memory (and thus potentially invoke string.h functions) or will expand in-place (no move). The contract of this function matters for whether unsafe copies can occur.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/config)\n  - The code relies on several mhd_assert checks to establish invariants used by the subsequent reallocate call (e.g., append_offset <= size). You must know whether mhd_assert is enabled in the analyzed build (or if it is a no-op) to determine whether those invariants are guaranteed at runtime; if asserts are disabled the function may call pool routines with weaker preconditions, changing whether bounds violations (in string.h calls inside pool code) are possible.\n\nIn short: to decide if any string.h calls (memcpy/memmove/etc.) invoked as part of reallocation can access out-of-bounds memory, you must inspect the pool API and its implementation (get_free, is_resizable_inplace, reallocate) together with the concrete layout/semantics of MHD_Connection and MemoryPool and whether asserted invariants are actually enforced at runtime."
