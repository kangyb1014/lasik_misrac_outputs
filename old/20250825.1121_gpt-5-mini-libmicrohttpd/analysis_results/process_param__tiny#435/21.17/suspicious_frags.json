  "explanation": "The remaining code does not call any <string.h> functions (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and therefore does not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The other statements only read boolean fields of tool_params and assign tool_params.tiny; these operations do not perform string accesses or use library string functions and need no investigation for this specific rule. The only uses of a string pointer in this function are the three fprintf calls and the explicit indexing of param_name[1], which are listed above for investigation."
