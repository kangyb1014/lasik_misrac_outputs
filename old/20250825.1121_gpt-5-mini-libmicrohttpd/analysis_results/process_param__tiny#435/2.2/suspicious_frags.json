Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I marked all code elements that could constitute dead code or indicate dead-code issues for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: the static function itself (a static function that is never referenced would be dead), the three conditional blocks that perform checks and return (they could be never taken, or their bodies could be redundant depending on tool_params usage), the assignment to tool_params.tiny (an assignment whose value is never subsequently used would be dead), and the final conditional return (which may select between two results that one of which is never used). Other fragments in the routine are simple syntactic elements (braces, parameter declaration, string literals inside fprintf, and the stderr stream) or are directly tied to the above fragments (the fprintf and return statements are part of the if-blocks already listed). These remaining parts do not independently represent operations that could be removed without effect beyond what is already captured by the listed suspicious fragments, so they do not need separate investigation."
