Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__tiny:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__tiny (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.empty)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-E' or '--empty'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.medium)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-M' or '--medium'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.large)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-L' or '--large'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.tiny = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (tool_params.medium)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-M' or '--medium'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not enough context is provided to prove these statements are dead. As written, the if (tool_params.medium) branch performs observable actions (fprintf to stderr and returns a different enum value) and so is not dead. The rule would only be violated if it can be shown that the branch is always executed but its removal would not change program behaviour. For example, a concrete violation scenario would be: the program always calls process_param__tiny with callers that ignore the function return value, stderr is permanently redirected to /dev/null (so the fprintf has no observable effect), and some other program logic makes tool_params.medium always true at this point \u2014 then the fprintf+return sequence would be executed but its removal would not affect behaviour, so it would be dead code and violate Rule 2.2."
