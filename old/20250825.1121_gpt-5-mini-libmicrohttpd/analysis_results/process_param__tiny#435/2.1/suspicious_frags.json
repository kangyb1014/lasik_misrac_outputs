  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the provided snippets. Control flow: each of the three initial if-blocks may perform an early return (reachable when the condition is true); if none of those conditions hold, execution proceeds to set tool_params.tiny and then reaches the final return. The final return is always reachable on the path where the early returns are not taken. The access to param_name[1] is a single read of the second character of the supplied string (reading a terminating '\\0' is defined behavior), so it does not introduce unreachable code. The static initializer for tool_params does not contain any code statements and therefore cannot be unreachable. For these reasons there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
