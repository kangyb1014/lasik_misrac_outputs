  "explanation": "I reviewed the function process_param__tiny and the tool_params initialization. I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions (no __attribute__, __asm, typeof, __extension__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, GCC-style labels-as-values, or other non-standard tokens). The constructs present (unary !, ternary ?:, character literal comparison, string literal concatenation across adjacent literals, array indexing, static struct initialization, and enum return type) are all standard C and not compiler extensions. The additional snippet\u2019s missing trailing semicolon appears to be a transcription/formatting issue rather than a language-extension usage. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2."
