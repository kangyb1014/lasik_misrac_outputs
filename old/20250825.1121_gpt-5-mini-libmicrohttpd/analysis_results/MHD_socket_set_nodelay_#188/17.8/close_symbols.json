  "explanation": "- MHD_socket (typedef): You must know whether the parameter 'sock' is an integer/value type or a pointer type. MISRA treats pointer parameters differently (the object pointed-to may be modified, the pointer itself shall not). The typedef determines whether passing/using 'sock' could involve pointer semantics or implicit modification concerns.\n- bool (type / stdbool.h or project typedef): Confirm that the parameter 'on' is a simple boolean scalar and not a macro or type with hidden side effects. That ensures reads of 'on' (e.g. the ternary test) do not constitute a modification and that 'on' cannot be an alias for something modifiable in a surprising way.\n- MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_ (typedef): The local constants on_val/off_val are of this type; knowing its underlying type confirms that taking their addresses and casting to const void* is ordinary and does not cause any hidden modification of the parameter variables.\n- setsockopt (function prototype or macro definition): The call to setsockopt is the only place the parameters are passed into another routine. If setsockopt is actually a macro or an unusual inline/function-like construct that could assign to or otherwise modify the caller's parameter variables (e.g. via macro expansion), that would be relevant to the MISRA rule. The real declaration/definition shows whether the call can mutate local parameters.\n- TCP_NODELAY (preprocessor macro): Controls which code path is compiled. If TCP_NODELAY is not defined the function compiles to the (void) sock; return 0 variant, which affects whether any use of parameters occurs. You must know whether the TCP_NODELAY branch is present to decide if parameters are used/potentially modified.\n- IPPROTO_TCP (preprocessor macro): Included to fully understand the setsockopt call signature and to confirm the option-level argument types expected by setsockopt; this helps verify that the call is a normal API call (no unusual side-effects on the local parameter variables)."
