  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters are: 'MHD_socket sock' (passed by value) and 'bool on' (passed by value). Neither is assigned to, incremented/decremented, nor is their address taken anywhere in the code. The ternary expression uses the local const objects on_val/off_val and takes their addresses, not the address of a parameter. The (void) sock statement is only to silence unused-parameter warnings and does not modify the parameter. There are no pointer parameters whose value (the pointer itself) could be altered; thus Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) is not violated and no code fragments require further investigation for this rule."
