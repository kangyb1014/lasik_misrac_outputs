  "explanation": "- TCP_NODELAY: The #ifdef around the main body uses the presence/absence of this preprocessor symbol to select two completely different function bodies. Whether TCP_NODELAY is defined is essential to decide if any runtime controlling expressions exist (when undefined the function unconditionally returns 0).\\n- IPPROTO_TCP: Passed to setsockopt as the level argument. Knowing this symbol is needed to understand whether the call is a normal runtime call or possibly resolved/optimized away by platform-specific macros; it also documents that setsockopt is a true runtime call rather than a compile-time construct.\\n- setsockopt: The external function invoked and whose return value is directly returned by MHD_socket_set_nodelay_. To analyze whether any controlling expression is invariant you must know that this is a runtime library call (its prototype and semantics: int setsockopt(int, int, int, const void *, socklen_t)).\\n- MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_: The typedef/type of on_val/off_val. Its underlying type determines sizeof(on_val) (the optlen passed to setsockopt) and whether the constants are compile-time/invariant values; the type also affects whether the conditional expression could be considered invariant.\\n- MHD_socket: The socket descriptor type used as the first argument to setsockopt. Its definition is needed to know whether it can be an invariant or a compile-time constant in some builds (and to ensure correct interpretation of the call signature).\\n- bool: The type of the parameter on. To determine if the controlling expression ((on) ? &on_val : &off_val) or any other control expression is invariant you must know the semantics of the boolean type in this build (e.g. whether it is a macro, typedef, and its allowed values).\\n- socklen_t: The type used for the optlen parameter in setsockopt (sizeof(on_val) is passed). Its prototype/definition is needed to ensure the sizeof expression is a compile-time constant of the expected type and to reason about whether any control or call is subject to compile-time folding/optimization.\\n\\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine which code is actually compiled in (#ifdef TCP_NODELAY), whether any controlling expressions in that compiled code are compile-time invariant, and whether the setsockopt call is a genuine runtime control/action rather than a compile-time invariant expression."
