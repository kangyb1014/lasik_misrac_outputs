  "explanation": "No selection or iteration statements with controlling expressions are present in the function body (no if, for, while, do-while, or switch). The only conditional usage is the conditional (?:) operator: (on) ? &on_val : &off_val \u2014 this is not a controlling expression of a selection/iteration statement covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The preprocessor directive #ifdef TCP_NODELAY is a compile-time conditional, not a runtime controlling expression. The function\u2019s behavior depends on the parameter 'on' (not invariant) and there are no invariant loop/selection conditions or do-while constant-false constructs that would require application of the rule or its exceptions. Therefore there are no code fragments that warrant investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
