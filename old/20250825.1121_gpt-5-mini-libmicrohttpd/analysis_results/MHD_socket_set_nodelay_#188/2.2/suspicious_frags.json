  "explanation": "Fragments not reported do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 because they perform observable operations or are conditional-compile alternatives (not runtime dead code): the setsockopt(...) call (and its return) is a runtime system call that affects socket behaviour and cannot be removed without changing program behaviour; the ternary expression selecting which address to pass is used by setsockopt so it is not removable without changing behaviour; the #ifdef / #else branches are compile-time configuration choices (unreachable-at-runtime in a particular build is not \u2018dead code\u2019 per the rule notes). The three reported fragments are suspicious because they are operations that are executed (or cause initialization) but have no effect on program behaviour if removed: the (void) sock; statement is a no-op used solely to silence an unused-parameter warning; the local const initializations (off_val/on_val) and taking their addresses are candidates for investigation (they may be redundant depending on how setsockopt is used or could be replaced by other mechanisms); the explicit cast to (const void *) around the ternary is syntactic/no-op for semantics and could indicate redundant code. These should be reviewed to confirm they are not dead code per MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2."
