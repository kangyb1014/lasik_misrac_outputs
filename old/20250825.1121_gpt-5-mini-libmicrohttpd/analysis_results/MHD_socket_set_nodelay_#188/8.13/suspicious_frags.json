  "explanation": "Only code that involves taking addresses or passing pointers is relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The three fragments above cover the declarations of the objects whose addresses are taken and the setsockopt call that passes a pointer to them. Other parts of the function do not perform pointer operations or pointer conversions (the function signature, preprocessor guards, the (void) sock discard, the return 0 in the #else branch, and comments), so they do not need investigation with respect to Rule 8.13."
