  "explanation": "1) setsockopt (declaration / prototype): The crucial question for the MISRA rule is whether the callee's parameter that receives the buffer is declared as const (e.g. const void *optval) or as a non-const pointer (void *). If setsockopt's prototype expects a non-const pointer, passing a pointer to a const object would either require removing const (potential MISRA violation) or indicate a mismatch. Therefore the exact prototype (parameter types and const-qualification) is required.  \n\n2) MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_ (typedef / underlying type): The objects whose addresses are taken (on_val, off_val) are declared as const MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_. To reason about the pointer resulting from &on_val / &off_val and whether it is a pointer-to-const, the underlying typedef/type must be known. This also clarifies whether the cast to (const void *) preserves constness correctly.  \n\n3) MHD_socket (typedef): setsockopt's first parameter type (usually an int or a socket descriptor type) must match the MHD_socket typedef to ensure the call is to the intended API. While not directly about pointer constness, confirming the parameter types ensures we are analyzing the correct setsockopt overload/prototype and that the call-site is well-formed.  \n\n4) TCP_NODELAY (preprocessor macro / whether defined): The code that takes addresses of the const objects and calls setsockopt is inside #ifdef TCP_NODELAY. If TCP_NODELAY is not defined the pointer use does not occur (function returns 0). To determine whether the pointer-related code is even part of the compiled program (and thus subject to MISRA scrutiny) you must know whether TCP_NODELAY is defined in the build configuration."
