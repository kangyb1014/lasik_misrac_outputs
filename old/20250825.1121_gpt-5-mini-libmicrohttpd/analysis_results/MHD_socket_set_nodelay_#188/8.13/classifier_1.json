  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: off_val is declared const (const MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_ off_val = 0) and its address is passed as a const void *; therefore any pointer to it is const-qualified. A violation would occur if off_val were declared non-const while its address were taken and used via a pointer that should be const-qualified."
