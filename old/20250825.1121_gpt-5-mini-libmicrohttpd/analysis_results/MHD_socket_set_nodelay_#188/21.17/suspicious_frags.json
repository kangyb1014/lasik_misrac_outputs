  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in this function, so Rule 21.17 (bounds of objects referenced by string.h pointer parameters) does not apply. The only pointer passed is (const void *)((on) ? &on_val : &off_val) to setsockopt, and the length passed is sizeof(on_val). on_val and off_val are objects of the same type, so the pointer/size pair is consistent and does not imply an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. The alternative branch when TCP_NODELAY is not defined simply avoids use of socket options. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
