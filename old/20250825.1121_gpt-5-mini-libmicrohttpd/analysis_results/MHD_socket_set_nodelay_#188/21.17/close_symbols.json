  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for MISRA C string-function-bounds analysis:\n\n- setsockopt (declaration/prototype): The target calls setsockopt. To reason about whether any pointer/length passed could lead to out-of-bounds string.h calls you must know the prototype (parameter types) and expected semantics (optval is a pointer, optlen is the length). The prototype shows types (const void*, socklen_t) and how sizes are passed.\n\n- implementation/definition of setsockopt (C library / OS): The MISRA rule targets use of string.h functions. The call site itself does not call string functions, but the runtime implementation of setsockopt (in libc or kernel) might. To determine if this call could invoke a string.h routine that accesses beyond the provided buffer you must inspect the actual implementation (or platform contract) of setsockopt for this option (TCP_NODELAY) and verify how it consumes optval/optlen.\n\n- socklen_t (typedef): setsockopt's optlen uses socklen_t. You need the exact typedef width and semantics to check for implicit conversions/truncations of sizeof(on_val) and to reason about whether the optlen value passed is correctly represented and safe for the implementation.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef): The first parameter type of the target function. Knowing its underlying type (usually int or platform socket handle type) is necessary to match the setsockopt prototype and ensure the call is well-typed; mismatches could change how the call is marshalled and therefore how optval/optlen are interpreted by the implementation.\n\n- MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_ (typedef / underlying type & size): The code takes sizeof(on_val) and passes &on_val as optval. To ensure no out-of-bounds access or mis-sized transfer you must know the exact size and representation of MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_ (e.g., is it an int, char, enum) so that sizeof(on_val) is correct and the pointed object is sized as the implementation expects.\n\n- TCP_NODELAY (macro): The code is conditional on this option name (also passed to setsockopt). The implementation may treat different option names differently (for TCP_NODELAY it usually expects an integer-sized bool). Knowing this macro (and that the branch is active) is necessary to inspect the correct code path in the setsockopt implementation/documentation.\n\n- IPPROTO_TCP (macro): The level argument to setsockopt. Like TCP_NODELAY, the interpretation/expected size of optval depends on the level/optname pair; you need this to consult the implementation/ABI/docs to verify how many bytes setsockopt will read and whether the provided &on_val and sizeof(on_val) match that expectation.\n\nIn short: to determine any possible violation of the string-handling-bounds rule you must (1) inspect whether setsockopt (or its platform implementation) uses string.h functions on the provided optval, and (2) confirm the passed pointer and size match what the implementation expects. The listed symbols provide the required declarations, types, option identifiers, and the implementation body to perform that analysis."
