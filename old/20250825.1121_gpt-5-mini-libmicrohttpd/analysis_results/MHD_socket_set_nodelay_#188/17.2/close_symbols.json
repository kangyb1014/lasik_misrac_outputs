  "explanation": "1) setsockopt: This is the only function called from MHD_socket_set_nodelay_. To determine if MHD_socket_set_nodelay_ violates the MISRA recursion rule you must examine setsockopt\u2019s implementation (or its static-call graph/wrapper) to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls MHD_socket_set_nodelay_ (or any function that leads back to it). If setsockopt is a library/system call, confirm there is no project-level wrapper with the same name that could call back into MHD code.\n\n2) TCP_NODELAY: This preprocessor macro controls whether the setsockopt call is compiled in. If TCP_NODELAY is not defined the function returns 0 and makes no calls; if defined, the setsockopt path is taken. You must know whether TCP_NODELAY is defined in the build so you know whether setsockopt needs to be analyzed."
