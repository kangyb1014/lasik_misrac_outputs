  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for unreachable-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- TCP_NODELAY\n  - This preprocessor macro controls the #ifdef that includes or excludes the entire setsockopt block. Whether TCP_NODELAY is defined in the build configuration determines which statements are present in the translation unit; thus it directly decides whether the first branch is compiled (and potentially reachable) or removed (making that source text unreachable in that build).\n\n- setsockopt\n  - The call inside the TCP_NODELAY branch is the only runtime action there. To determine whether that branch contains reachable code you must know if setsockopt is a normal function, a macro that expands differently, or is annotated with attributes (e.g. noreturn). Any nonstandard expansion or attributes could affect control flow or make following code unreachable.\n\n- IPPROTO_TCP\n  - Although it does not change control flow itself, IPPROTO_TCP is an external macro/constant used in the setsockopt call. If it is missing or conditionally defined in headers, it may affect whether the code compiles into the same form across builds; that influences whether the branch is present in the final build under project configuration checks.\n\n- MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_\n  - The type of on_val/off_val used in the ternary and sizeof expression. If this identifier is a macro/typedef with unusual expansion (or absent in some configurations), it could change compilation and hence reachability of the code in some project configurations.\n\n- MHD_socket\n  - The declared type of the sock parameter. If MHD_socket is a macro or typedef that differs across builds (or expands to an unusable type), that can affect whether the function body is valid/compiled in certain configurations, which matters when checking for unreachable code across the project.\n\n- bool\n  - The parameter type affects the interpretation of the ternary expression and may be a macro/typedef in some projects (for example older code using custom bool). Differences in its definition across build configurations may change whether the function is accepted by the compiler and therefore whether parts of it are present/eligible for reachability analysis.\n\nNote: The key symbol for reachability is TCP_NODELAY (preprocessor control). The remaining symbols are included because their definitions or macro-ness can alter compilation or control-flow attributes of the TCP_NODELAY branch in different project configurations; determining unreachable code in the project requires knowledge of these symbols as they exist in the project's build environment."
