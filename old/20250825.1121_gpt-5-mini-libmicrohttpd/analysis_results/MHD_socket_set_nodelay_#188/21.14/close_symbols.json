  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings:\n\n- setsockopt: This is the only function called in the TCP_NODELAY branch. To prove the target function itself does not use memcmp (directly or indirectly), the implementation or reachable callees of setsockopt must be inspected to ensure they do not call memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- TCP_NODELAY: The preprocessor conditional #ifdef TCP_NODELAY controls whether the setsockopt path is compiled. Knowing whether TCP_NODELAY is defined (and its expansion/value) is required to determine which code path exists in the compiled code (call to setsockopt vs. early return), so it affects whether any memcmp usage in the active path must be considered.\n\n- IPPROTO_TCP: The constant passed to setsockopt (protocol argument) could influence which implementation path inside setsockopt or lower layers is exercised. To reason about potential downstream memcmp usage it is necessary to know the actual protocol value being supplied.\n\n- MHD_SCKT_OPT_BOOL_: The typedef/type of the on_val/off_val determines the type and size passed to setsockopt. You need to confirm these are not pointers to strings (they are integer/boolean values) so you can exclude the possibility that a string pointer is being passed and later compared with memcmp.\n\n- MHD_socket: The socket type of the sock parameter is required to understand what kind of handle is being passed into setsockopt and whether any wrapper layers (or alternate overloads) might treat it in a way that causes string comparisons further down the call chain.\n\n- memcmp: The rule concerns the Standard Library function memcmp. Include this symbol so the analysis can search for direct or indirect (through setsockopt or other callees/macros) uses of memcmp and verify whether any such calls compare NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\nTogether these symbols allow the next agent to (1) determine which branch is compiled, (2) inspect the called functions/implementations reachable from the active branch, and (3) verify whether memcmp is used there to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
