  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I reviewed the function and the related symbol definitions for uses of compiler-specific language extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __declspec, #pragma non-standard pragmas, or other constructs documented as vendor extensions). None of those appear in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C (enum, struct, bool/_Bool, volatile, macros, conditional compilation #ifdef, preprocessor line-continuation backslashes, function calls, pointer/field accesses, standard integer types like uint64_t, and library types such as gnutls_session_t). Conditional compilation flags (HTTPS_SUPPORT, EPOLL_SUPPORT, etc.) and the macro expansions shown are normal preprocessor usage, not compiler language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no explicit compiler language extensions found)."
