  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modification of function parameters. In the shown code the value parameter 'read_ready' is assigned to (read_ready = true;) inside the function (within the HTTPS_SUPPORT conditional), which is a direct modification of a non\u2011pointer parameter and therefore violates Rule 17.8. The pointer exception in the rule (you may modify the object referred to by a pointer parameter, but not the pointer itself) does not apply here because 'read_ready' is a value (bool) parameter. Recommended fix: introduce a local variable (e.g. bool read_ready_local = read_ready;) and modify/inspect that instead of modifying the parameter."
