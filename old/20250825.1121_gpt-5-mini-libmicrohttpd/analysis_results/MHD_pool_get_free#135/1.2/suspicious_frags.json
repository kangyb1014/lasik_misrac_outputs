  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- No compiler-specific keywords or built-ins are used (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __thread, typeof, typeof-like GCC extensions, or other vendor intrinsics).\n- No statement-expression GCC extension ({ ... }) or nested functions are present.\n- No inline assembly, naked functions, or pragma/vendor-specific directives appear (only standard #ifdef/#endif are used).\n- All types used (size_t, uint8_t, bool) are standard C types or standard-library typedefs, not compiler extensions.\n- Macros (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE, mhd_assert) are ordinary preprocessor constructs, not language extensions.\n\nNote: Identifier _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE begins with an underscore and an uppercase letter; this is in the implementation-reserved namespace and may be a portability/style concern but is not a compiler language extension per se, so it is not reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
