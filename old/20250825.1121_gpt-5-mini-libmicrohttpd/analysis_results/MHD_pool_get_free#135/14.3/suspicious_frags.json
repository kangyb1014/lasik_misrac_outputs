  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function appear to be invariant and therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. Reasoning:\n\n- The only explicit selection statement present is the if ((pool->end - pool->pos) <= _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE) inside the #ifdef. That expression depends on runtime structure members (pool->end and pool->pos) and on the macro _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE; it is not an invariant constant expression and so does not violate Rule 14.3.\n\n- The mhd_assert(...) lines contain assertions whose expressions also depend on structure members or a macro call (ROUND_TO_ALIGN). Those are not invariant controlling expressions at the source level. If mhd_assert is implemented using a macro that expands to a do { ... } while (0) wrapper, that wrapper\u2019s controlling expression (while (0)) is an invariant constant false \u2014 but this pattern is explicitly permitted by the rule exceptions (a do-while with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and is an integer constant expression is allowed). Thus typical assert-wrapper expansion does not require investigation under Rule 14.3.\n\n- The preprocessor #ifdef / #endif are not C controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3.\n\n- There are no loop constructs (while, for, do-while) in the visible source whose controlling expressions could be invariant (other than a potential macro wrapper as noted above, which is allowed by the exception).\n\nTherefore no fragments in this function warrant further inspection for Rule 14.3."
