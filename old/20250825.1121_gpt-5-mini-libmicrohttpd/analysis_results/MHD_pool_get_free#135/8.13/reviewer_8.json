The pointer could be declared 'const struct MemoryPool *pool' since the function does not modify the pointed-to object, so Rule 8.13 is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The function takes struct MemoryPool *pool but only reads members (pool->end, pool->pos) and does not modify the pointed-to object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so the parameter could be declared const struct MemoryPool *pool. There is no evidence in the shown code that prevents making it const (assertions and macros shown only read values). The only caveats would be API compatibility concerns or hidden uses outside the shown snippet that require a non-const parameter; absent such justification, the agent A report is correct."
