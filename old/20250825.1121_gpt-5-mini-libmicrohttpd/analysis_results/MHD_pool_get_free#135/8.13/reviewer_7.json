According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type when possible (i.e. 'const struct MemoryPool *pool'). Therefore the use of the non-const pointer here (as seen in the fragment 'mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);') violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The function only reads members of *pool and does not modify the object, so the parameter could and, per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, should be declared as pointer to const (const struct MemoryPool *pool). Absent any overriding justification (for example, API compatibility, a required non-const prototype for callbacks, or other uses not shown that require a non-const pointer), this is a violation of Rule 8.13."
