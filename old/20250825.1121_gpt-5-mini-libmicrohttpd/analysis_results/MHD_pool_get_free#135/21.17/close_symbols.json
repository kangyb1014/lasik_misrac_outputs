  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for analyzing MISRA rule compliance:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: The function computes and returns (pool->end - pool->pos) minus a red-zone. To determine whether these subtractions and comparisons are well-formed and cannot produce out-of-bounds memory accesses you must know the exact types and semantics of pos, end and size (are they pointers into a buffer, indices, signed/unsigned types, element types?). This determines whether pointer subtraction, unsigned underflow, or wraparound can occur and whether the returned value correctly represents available space.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: The assert checks pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos). If ROUND_TO_ALIGN is a macro or function that manipulates pointers or integers (e.g. rounds up/down to alignment), it could affect whether pos is a valid aligned address inside the buffer. You must inspect its implementation (and any alignment constants it uses) to ensure it cannot produce values that would lead to out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic or hide incorrect assumptions about buffer boundaries.\n\n- mhd_assert: The assertion macro/function may be a no-op in some builds or may evaluate expressions with side effects in others. You need its definition to know whether the assert can change semantics (e.g. call other code, perform casts, or be compiled out), which affects whether the checked invariants are guaranteed at runtime. If mhd_assert calls other helpers that use <string.h> functions, that is also relevant.\n\n- _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE: This constant is subtracted from the free-space calculation and guarded in the conditional. Its value and type determine whether the arithmetic (pool->end - pool->pos) - _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE can underflow or otherwise produce incorrect sizes that might later lead callers to perform out-of-bounds memcpy/memset etc. You must know its numeric value and signedness.\n\n- MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE: The presence or absence of this build macro changes control flow (the early return when available). To fully analyze all compiled variants of the function and their implications for downstream use (callers that may rely on the returned free size to perform string.h operations), you must know whether this macro can be defined and what build configurations enable it.\n\nTogether these symbols let you reason about types, arithmetic, alignment guarantees, and compile-time variants so you can determine whether this function ever returns values or manipulates pointers in a way that could enable callers to invoke <string.h> functions that access memory out of bounds."
