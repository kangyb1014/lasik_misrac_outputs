  "explanation": "- mhd_assert: This is a macro/function used in the target. It could expand to or call other code (including library calls) \u2014 to prove the function does not use memcmp you must inspect mhd_assert's definition/expansion to ensure it does not call memcmp (directly or via another macro).  \n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: This macro is used in the assertion. Its expansion might contain function calls (or macros) that could call memcmp; inspect it to ensure no memcmp usage.  \n- MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE: This conditional compilation symbol controls the presence of an #ifdef block. You must know its value/definition to determine whether the conditional code is compiled in; if the active configuration compiles different code paths, those paths must be inspected for memcmp usage.  \n- _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE: This macro/constant is used in the arithmetic and in the #ifdef block. If it is defined via a macro that pulls in other code (unlikely but possible), inspect its definition; also needed to understand if any helper macros/functions are introduced that could call memcmp.  \n- struct MemoryPool (members: end, pos, size): The types and possible overloaded/embedded semantics of these members could hide inline functions or accessors that call other routines. Inspect the struct definition (and any accessors/macros for these members) to ensure reading pool->end, pool->pos, pool->size does not invoke code that uses memcmp.\n\nThese symbols cover all places in the target function that could hide calls to memcmp (assertions, macros, conditionally compiled code, or member access). Once these are inspected and shown not to expand to or call memcmp, the target function can be considered free of memcmp usage relevant to the MISRA rule."
