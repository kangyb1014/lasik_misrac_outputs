  "explanation": "I examined the function MHD_pool_get_free and the related macro definitions. There is no use of the standard library function memcmp (nor of any other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) in the target function or in the provided related macros. The code only performs integer/size arithmetic and conditional checks: mhd_assert is defined to ((void)0) (no runtime call), ROUND_TO_ALIGN performs numeric alignment arithmetic, and _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE is defined as 0. The optional MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE block contains no string operations. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
