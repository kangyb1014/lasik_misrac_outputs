  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide if code is dead w.r.t. the MISRA rule:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (full definition: types of pos, end, size)\n  - The function's logic and whether arithmetic/subtraction or comparisons are meaningful (and possibly always true/false) depends on the exact field types (e.g., unsigned vs signed, width). Knowing these types lets you determine whether expressions like (pool->end >= pool->pos) or (pool->end - pool->pos) can ever be false/underflow or are tautologies (making assertions or branches redundant).\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function and its implementation)\n  - The assertions are executed code that might be compiled out or implemented with side effects (logging, abort). To determine if the assertion statements constitute dead code you must know whether mhd_assert expands to no-op in production builds or performs observable actions. If it is a no-op, the assertion code is dead; if it has effects, it is not.\n\n- macros controlling assertions (e.g. NDEBUG / any macro mhd_assert depends on)\n  - mhd_assert behavior often depends on build-mode macros. The presence/absence of those macros changes whether the assertion code exists in the compiled program; thus they are required to decide if the assertion-related code is dead.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN (macro/function implementation and any macros it depends on)\n  - The assertion compares pool->pos to ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos). If ROUND_TO_ALIGN is the identity for all valid inputs the assertion is redundant; if it can alter values or has side effects, the assertion may have behavioural impact. You must inspect its implementation (and any alignment constants it uses) to decide whether the assertion is dead.\n\n- _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE (definition and type)\n  - The return value and the conditional under the MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE branch depend on this constant. If it is zero the if-block and subtraction may be no-ops; if it has a fixed value that makes the if condition always true/false for all valid pools, that branch becomes dead. Knowing its value and type is necessary to determine whether the conditional and arithmetic are dead code.\n\n- MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE (preprocessor definition state)\n  - The #ifdef controls whether the if ((pool->end - pool->pos) <= _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE) return 0; code exists at all. If the macro is not defined the whole conditional is absent (dead relative to that build). Its defined/undefined state in the target build is required to judge dead code.\n\n(If ROUND_TO_ALIGN or mhd_assert themselves depend on further macros/constants, include those dependent symbols as well when presenting to the next analyzer.)"
