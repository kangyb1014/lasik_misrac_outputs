In that configuration the call can be removed without affecting program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Incorrect. MISRA 2.2 targets operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. If mhd_assert is defined as a no-op (e.g. #define mhd_assert(x) ((void)0)), the assertion expands to nothing (no executed operation) \u2014 there is no executed code to be \u201cdead\u201d. The preprocessor/macros remove the operation before compilation, so Rule 2.2 (which concerns executed-but-removable code in the project) is not violated. (If instead the assert macro left an evaluated but effect-free expression in the generated object code, that could be a different concern, but that is not the scenario asserted by agent A.)"
