Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_get_free:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_pool_get_free (struct MemoryPool *pool)\n{\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n#ifdef MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE\n  if ((pool->end - pool->pos) <= _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE)\n    return 0;\n#endif /* MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE */\n  return (pool->end - pool->pos) - _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The statement is an assertion (mhd_assert) that checks a runtime invariant. If the assertion macro is enabled it may abort or otherwise alter control flow on failure; if disabled (compiled out) it is not executed. Because its presence can change program behaviour when the invariant is violated (it can detect and stop invalid execution), its removal would affect behaviour in those cases. Therefore this line does not constitute dead code and does not violate Rule 2.2."
