  "explanation": "I flagged the three mhd_assert statements because the macro is defined as ((void)0) in the provided context; the presence/absence or differing definitions of that macro in other build configurations can change control flow or remove checks that callers may rely on, so these lines should be inspected for potential reachability/invariant assumptions. I flagged the #ifdef MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE block because it is conditionally compiled: when MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE is defined the early return may alter reachable code paths compared to builds where it is not defined; this conditional compilation and its interaction with _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE should be reviewed. I flagged the final return because it subtracts _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE (here defined as 0) \u2014 the compile-time constant and conditional-compilation combinations can make one of the return paths redundant or change which code is actually reachable in some configurations. Other fragments do not need investigation for unreachable-code concerns: the struct MemoryPool definition and the ROUND_TO_ALIGN and _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE macros (as provided) do not themselves introduce unreachable statements; the arithmetic expressions (pool->end - pool->pos) and the ROUND_TO_ALIGN macro expand to ordinary integer operations and do not create control-flow that would render subsequent code unreachable. There are no loops, switch/case fall-throughs, or statements after unconditional returns/infinite loops elsewhere in the snippet that would constitute obvious unreachable code beyond the conditionally compiled and macro-affected fragments listed above."
