  "explanation": "- mhd_assert: The function uses mhd_assert three times. mhd_assert may be a macro or function that can expand/call other functions; to prove there is no indirect recursion you must inspect mhd_assert\u2019s definition and any functions it invokes to ensure none eventually call MHD_pool_get_free or its callers.\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: This macro is used in an assertion; if it expands to code that calls functions or other macros, those could create an indirect call path back to MHD_pool_get_free. Inspect its definition.\n- MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE: Conditional compilation flag controls whether the extra branch is present. You must know whether the branch is compiled in (and if so what code it contains) to conclude about possible call paths.\n- _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE: The size constant is used in the branch condition; include its definition to understand the compiled behavior of the conditional and whether the branch introduces any calls.\n- struct MemoryPool (definition): Verify that pool->pos and pool->end are plain data members (not accessors or macros or containing function pointers). If they are implemented via inline functions, macros, or contain function pointers, those could introduce calls that lead to recursion.\n- try_ready_chunked_body, try_grow_read_buffer, connection_maximize_write_buffer: These are the known callers of MHD_pool_get_free (from the static call graph). To establish there is no indirect recursion you must inspect these callers and their callees to ensure there is no cycle; include them when checking potential call-return cycles.\n- any functions/macros called by mhd_assert (e.g. abort/__assert_fail/mhd_log): If mhd_assert expands to call standard assert-handling functions or project logging helpers, those implementations must be checked for any call chain that could reach back to MHD_pool_get_free or its callers.\n\nIn short: inspect the assertion and macro definitions used by MHD_pool_get_free, the MemoryPool layout, and the known callers (and any functions those macros call) to rule out any direct or indirect call path that would constitute recursion."
