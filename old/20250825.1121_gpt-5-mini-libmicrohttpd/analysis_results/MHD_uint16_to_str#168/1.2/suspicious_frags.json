  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses only standard C types (uint16_t, size_t) and the standard macro UINT16_C, which are C99/stdint features, not vendor extensions. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm, __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ...; }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or other known extensions. The /**< comment is a documentation-style comment but is still a standard C comment token sequence and not a language extension. The mhd_assert macro is defined as ((void)0), which is a portable macro expansion and not an extension. All casts, arithmetic, control structures and declarations used are standard C and do not require investigation for Rule 1.2."
