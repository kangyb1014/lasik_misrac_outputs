  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not modify function parameters and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 17.8. The pointer parameter buf is never reassigned (only the object it points to is written via chr and *chr, which is allowed); chr, divisor and digit are local variables that are modified; mhd_assert calls, casts and arithmetic that only read parameters do not modify them; loop conditions and return expressions only read parameter values. Hence only statements that perform assignments/decrements to parameters need scrutiny."
