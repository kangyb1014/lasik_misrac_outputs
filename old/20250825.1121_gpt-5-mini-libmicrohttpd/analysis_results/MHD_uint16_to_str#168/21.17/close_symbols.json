  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The function uses mhd_assert(digit < 10) at several points. Its definition may have side effects (logging, string formatting, calls into library routines) or may alter control flow in debug builds. To confidently assert that MHD_uint16_to_str does not indirectly invoke any <string.h> routine or access buffers via the assertion, the analyzer needs the mhd_assert implementation or macro expansion.\n\n- UINT16_C\n  - This macro supplies the initial divisor value (UINT16_C(10000)). Knowing its definition confirms the divisor value and type and ensures no unexpected behavior (e.g., integer promotions) that could affect index/division computations and thus buffer writes.\n\n- get_date_str\n  - This function is an immediate caller of MHD_uint16_to_str (per the call graph). To determine whether any subsequent use of the bytes written by MHD_uint16_to_str leads to string.h calls that could access out of bounds (e.g., callers assuming NUL-termination and calling strlen/strcat), the analyzer must inspect get_date_str\u2019s handling of the buffer and its calls.\n\n- get_date_header\n  - get_date_header calls get_date_str and is in the caller chain for date generation; it may allocate or append buffers and then call string.h routines. Including it lets the analyst follow how buffers produced by MHD_uint16_to_str are used later in the date/header path.\n\n- build_header_response\n  - This is another direct caller. It orchestrates header building and calls many buffer-manipulating helpers. The analyzer must inspect how build_header_response allocates buffers, passes buf and buf_size into MHD_uint16_to_str, and whether it subsequently uses any <string.h> functions on the written bytes (which could cause out-of-bounds reads if the buffer wasn\u2019t NUL-terminated or size was miscalculated).\n\n- buffer_append\n  - build_header_response calls buffer_append to concatenate/appends header fragments. buffer_append is a likely place where standard string functions (memcpy/strcat/strlen/strncat/...) may be used. To rule out any string.h out-of-bounds accesses involving the data written by MHD_uint16_to_str, the implementation of buffer_append must be examined.\n\n- MHD_uint8_to_str_pad and MHD_uint64_to_str\n  - These sibling numeric-to-string helpers are used by the same callers. Examining their implementations helps ensure consistent conventions (e.g., whether they NUL-terminate, return lengths, check buf_size) and whether callers assume a particular behavior that could lead to improper use of string.h functions on buffers produced by MHD_uint16_to_str.\n\nNote: basic standard typedefs (uint16_t, size_t, char) and standard semantics of arithmetic/pointer operations are assumed; they are not listed as extra symbols. The symbols above are the minimal additional items needed to determine whether MHD_uint16_to_str itself \u2014 or its immediate use sites \u2014 result in any use of <string.h> functions that could access out of bounds."
