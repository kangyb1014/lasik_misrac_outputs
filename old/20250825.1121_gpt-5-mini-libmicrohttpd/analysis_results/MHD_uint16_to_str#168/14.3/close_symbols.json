Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- mhd_assert: The function calls mhd_assert several times inside the loops. To prove that the while controlling expressions are not invariant you must ensure mhd_assert has no side-effects that change digit, divisor, buf_size or val, and that it does not alter control flow in a way that would make the loop condition constant (for example by longjmp/exit or by changing globals). If mhd_assert is a no-op (or compile-time removed) the loops remain non-invariant; if it has side-effects the analysis can change.\n\n- UINT16_C: divisor is initialized with UINT16_C(10000). The exact expansion/type of this macro determines the initial value and type of divisor (e.g. 10000U, 10000). Knowing the macro definition ensures the divisor value and type are as assumed and therefore that (1 < divisor) and subsequent updates are non-constant.\n\n- uint16_t (definition from <stdint.h>): divisor, val and some intermediate computations use uint16_t. You need the exact unsigned 16-bit definition/range to reason about arithmetic (division/modulus), wrap-around, and to confirm that divisor and val actually change during the loops (so the loop conditions are not constant).\n\n- size_t (definition from <stddef.h>): buf_size is the controlling object in the second while. Its type and width (and signedness) matter to show that buf_size is modified in the loop (decremented) and therefore that the loop condition (0 != buf_size) is not invariant. Knowing the exact size_t definition removes ambiguity.\n\n- INT_MAX (or sizeof(int) / implementation int width): The expression (1 < divisor) involves integer promotions. Whether uint16_t promotes to int or to unsigned int depends on the width of int relative to uint16_t. To be sure the comparison is non-constant (and to reason about potential promotion-induced invariance), the analyser needs the target's INT_MAX/sizeof(int).\n\n- implementation/compiler integer-promotion rules (platform ABI): Closely related to INT_MAX, the platform's promotion rules (typical ABI) determine how uint16_t and literals are promoted in expressions and thus whether comparisons like (1 < divisor) and arithmetic produce the expected non-invariant results. Including this ensures the controlling expressions are evaluated as intended on the target platform.\n\nThese symbols collectively allow the next agent to determine whether any loop controlling expression in MHD_uint16_to_str is in fact invariant (constant) on the target platform or could be made invariant by side-effects or implementation-defined promotion behavior."
