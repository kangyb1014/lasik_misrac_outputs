  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the snippet do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: upg_header and con_header are already const-qualified (const char *). The string literal macros/strings (WS_UPGRADE_VALUE and \"Upgrade\") are string literals and are used via functions that accept const char * (strcmp, strstr). No other pointer declarations are present in the provided code; standard library function signatures (strcmp/strstr) are fixed and not subject to change. Therefore only the explicit non-const pointer parameter and its unused suppression require further review."
