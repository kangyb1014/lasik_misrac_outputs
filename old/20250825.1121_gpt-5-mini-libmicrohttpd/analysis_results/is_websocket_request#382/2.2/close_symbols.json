  "explanation": "For deciding whether is_websocket_request constitutes dead code you must not only inspect the function body but also how its return value is used and what inputs it can receive. Each listed symbol is required for the reasons below:\n\n- ahc_cb: The only static caller of is_websocket_request. You must inspect ahc_cb to see whether the call's return value affects program behaviour (branches, side effects). If ahc_cb ignores or never differentiates the return value, the call could be dead; if it conditions important actions on the result, it is not.\n\n- MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: The enum and its values are what is_websocket_request returns. To determine whether removing the call changes behaviour you need to know the semantic meaning of these values and how callers interpret them.\n\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: The constant/string compared to upg_header with strcmp. Its exact value determines whether the strcmp can ever succeed; if it cannot match any possible upg_header the function would always return MHD_NO and the call might be dead.\n\n- strcmp, strstr (string.h): The semantics of these functions determine the condition under which is_websocket_request returns MHD_YES. You need to know substring/search and comparison behaviour to reason about possible true/false outcomes.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value, MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: These functions (used in ahc_cb per the call graph) likely produce the upg_header and con_header arguments passed to is_websocket_request. Their behaviour/return values (possible strings or NULL) are necessary to determine whether the predicate in is_websocket_request can ever evaluate true.\n\n- send_chat_page, send_bad_request, send_upgrade_required, ws_get_accept_value, MHD_create_response_for_upgrade, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_destroy_response, MHD_queue_response: These are the other callees of ahc_cb. You must see which of these are invoked conditionally based on is_websocket_request's return. To decide if removing the call (or changing its outcome) would affect observable behaviour you need to know whether these side-effecting functions are reached only when is_websocket_request returns a particular value.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The type of the con parameter; while the parameter is cast away in is_websocket_request, the caller may use connection-related APIs to derive headers or manage control flow. Knowing the connection type and how ahc_cb uses it helps assess whether the headers passed to is_websocket_request can vary.\n\nIn short: inspect ahc_cb (and the functions it calls that produce header values or are conditionally invoked) plus the constants and string routines used in the predicate to determine whether is_websocket_request can ever produce a meaningful effect \u2014 the necessary information to judge the MISRA dead-code rule."
