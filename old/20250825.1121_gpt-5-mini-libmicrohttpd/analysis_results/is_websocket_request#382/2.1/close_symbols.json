  "explanation": "To determine whether any part of is_websocket_request is unreachable you must consider how it is called and what inputs it can receive. Provide the following symbols and why they matter:\n\n- ahc_cb: The only caller per the static call graph. You must inspect ahc_cb to see how upg_header and con_header are obtained and whether some call-site values make one branch impossible (e.g. always NULL or always equal to WS_UPGRADE_VALUE).\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value: ahc_cb uses this (or similar lookup functions) to produce upg_header/con_header. You need its behavior/contract (when it returns NULL vs non-NULL, whether it can return empty strings, lifetime of returned pointers) to decide if the conditions in is_websocket_request can evaluate both true and false.\n\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: The string constant compared against upg_header. If WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is defined in a way that makes the strcmp check always true/false for the values passed by ahc_cb, that could make code paths unreachable.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (definition including MHD_YES, MHD_NO): To determine whether either return value is meaningful or mapped/used elsewhere and to check for any definitions that could affect control-flow or macro redefinitions that alter behavior.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): Even though con is cast to void in the function, the caller may pass special sentinel values or macros for the connection pointer that affect analysis of caller behavior; include it to fully understand possible call-site values.\n\n- strcmp and strstr: Their semantics (standard C library behavior) are used in the compound condition. Include their declarations/expected behavior to be explicit about what constitutes a match/non-match (e.g. strcmp==0 means equality; strstr returns NULL when substring not found).\n\n- NULL macro/definition: The function branches on pointer-NULL checks; include the definition/semantics of NULL in the project (some projects redefine NULL) to be thorough.\n\nSupplying these symbols (source/headers or precise contracts) lets the next analyst determine whether either outcome (MHD_YES or MHD_NO) is impossible given all call-sites and therefore whether is_websocket_request contains unreachable code."
