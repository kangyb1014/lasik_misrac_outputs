  "explanation": "I inspected the target function and the related definitions for any use of memcmp; none is present. The code performs pointer null checks (upg_header != NULL, con_header != NULL), then calls strcmp(upg_header, WS_UPGRADE_VALUE) and strstr(con_header, \"Upgrade\"). Rule 21.14 specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings; this code uses strcmp and strstr, which are appropriate for null-terminated C strings. The only string constant involved (WS_UPGRADE_VALUE) is a string literal. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
