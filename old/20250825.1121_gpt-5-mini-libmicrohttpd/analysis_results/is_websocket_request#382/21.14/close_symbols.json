  "explanation": "- strcmp: The function uses strcmp. To determine whether the code violates the MISRA prohibition on using memcmp for NUL-terminated strings we must inspect strcmp\u2019s identity/implementation in the build (it could be a macro or wrapper that ultimately calls memcmp). If strcmp is implemented in terms of memcmp here, that could produce a violation.\n- strstr: The function calls strstr. Like strcmp, some library implementations or local replacements could delegate to memcmp; inspect strstr to ensure it does not use memcmp for NUL-terminated string comparison semantics in this build.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets memcmp specifically. We must check whether memcmp is referenced (directly or indirectly via macros/wrappers) by strcmp/strstr or by any macros used in this translation unit.\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: The constant compared by strcmp. Confirming its type and definition (that it is a NUL-terminated string literal or not) is necessary to establish whether the comparison is a null-terminated string comparison subject to the MISRA rule.\n- MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: These symbols appear in the return and identify the function\u2019s enum/result values; include them so the analyzer has the full symbol context of the function (ensures no hidden macros wrap the return path or change semantics).\n- NULL: Used in the function for pointer checks; include to ensure its definition has not been altered (e.g. redefined macro) which could affect analysis of pointer checks vs. byte-wise comparisons.\n\nInclude these symbols so the next agent can (1) confirm whether strcmp/strstr are pure library calls or macros/wrappers that call memcmp, (2) verify WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is a NUL-terminated string, and (3) detect any indirect use of memcmp that would trigger the MISRA rule violation."
