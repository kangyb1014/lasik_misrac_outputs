  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in is_websocket_request. The parameter con is explicitly cast to void (no modification). The pointer parameters upg_header and con_header are declared const and are only used as read-only arguments to strcmp and strstr, which do not modify the passed strings. There are no assignments to parameter variables, no pointer arithmetic on the parameters, and no reassignments of the pointer parameters themselves. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
