Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "upg_header / con_header: these function parameters are the runtime operands of the controlling conditional expression. To decide if the expression is invariant we must know whether their values can vary at runtime (or are fixed/constant at all call sites).\n\nWS_UPGRADE_VALUE: the literal or macro being compared by strcmp; if this symbol is a compile-time constant that is always matched (or never matched) for the values actually passed in, the controlling expression could be invariant \u2014 so its definition is required.\n\nstrcmp / strstr: these library calls determine the result of the logical sub-expressions. We must treat their semantics (runtime string comparison/search, not compile-time constants) as part of deciding whether the overall controlling expression can be evaluated at compile time or is dependent on runtime data.\n\nMHD_YES / MHD_NO and enum MHD_Result: the enumerated result values used in the conditional operator. Including the enum and its constants documents the return type and confirms the conditional is used only to select a return value (not to produce side-effects) \u2014 relevant when assessing whether the expression is an invariant boolean used in control flow.\n\nahc_cb: the sole caller of is_websocket_request (per the call graph). To determine if the controlling expression is invariant in the program, the caller(s) must be inspected to see what actual arguments are passed for upg_header and con_header (e.g. always NULL or always the same literal), so including ahc_cb is required to check call-site invariance."
