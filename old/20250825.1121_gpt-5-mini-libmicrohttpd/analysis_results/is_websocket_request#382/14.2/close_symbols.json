The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops, we must be sure no relevant for\u2011loops (or macros that expand to for\u2011loops) are introduced by symbols referenced in the target function. Explaination for each required symbol:\n\n- strcmp\n  - is_websocket_request calls strcmp. The implementation or macro expansion of strcmp could contain for loops; to be sure no ill\u2011formed for loops are introduced via this call (the rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of loop bodies), we need the strcmp declaration/implementation (or confirmation it is a library function without problematic for loops).\n\n- strstr\n  - similarly, strstr is called. Its definition/implementation or macro expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not contain for loops violating the rule or side effects that would change how a for loop in this function would be judged.\n\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE\n  - this identifier is used as the right\u2011hand operand of strcmp. It could be a macro that expands to an expression (even to code that contains loops). We need its definition to rule out any hidden for loops or side effects that could affect compliance.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO)\n  - the function returns these enum values. Their definitions are needed to ensure they are plain enum constants (no macros expanding to expressions or code containing for loops or side effects). If a return macro were used instead, it could hide constructs relevant to the rule.\n\n- NULL (macro)\n  - NULL is used in pointer comparisons. Although normally a plain macro, we must verify its definition in this build environment to exclude any unexpected macro expansion that could introduce code (including for loops) or side effects.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - the parameter type is unused in the function (cast away), but its definition or possible macro wrappers should be checked to ensure no macros or inline functions tied to that type expand into code with for loops (for example, if (void) con is actually a macro that does more).\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no for loops. The above symbols are required to establish that none of the referenced identifiers are macros or inline implementations that would introduce for loops (or other constructs) into the function text; per the MISRA rule the behaviour of called functions/macro expansions is considered when assessing for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness."
