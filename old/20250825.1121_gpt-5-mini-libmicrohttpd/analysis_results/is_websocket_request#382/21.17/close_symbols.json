  "explanation": "- strcmp: required to know its exact prototype/semantics (it scans both arguments until a '\\0') so we can determine whether calling strcmp(upg_header, WS_UPGRADE_VALUE) can read past the end of upg_header or WS_UPGRADE_VALUE. Also check for any project-specific replacement or wrapper for strcmp that may have different bounds/behavior.\n\n- strstr: required to know its exact prototype/semantics (it scans the haystack until a terminating '\\0') so we can determine whether calling strstr(con_header, \"Upgrade\") can read beyond the bounds of con_header. Also to check for any project-specific replacement or wrapper for strstr.\n\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: the target string compared against upg_header. We need its definition (value, whether it is a NUL-terminated literal or computed buffer) and lifetime to ensure the second argument to strcmp is a valid NUL-terminated object and to reason about its length.\n\n- ahc_cb: the caller that passes upg_header and con_header into is_websocket_request. We must inspect ahc_cb to see how upg_header and con_header are obtained (what functions produced them, whether they can be non-NUL-terminated or point into bounded buffers) and whether any guarantees (null-termination, minimum length) are established before the call.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value and MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: these helper functions appear in the caller and are likely sources of header strings (upg_header, con_header). We must inspect their behavior/contract: what they return (pointers into internal buffers vs. newly allocated strings), whether the returned pointers are always to NUL-terminated C strings, and whether there are any maximum lengths or partial/non-terminated returns that could lead strcmp/strstr to read out-of-bounds.\n\n- <string.h> (any local redefinitions/macros of strcmp/strstr): include the actual <string.h> prototypes used in the build and search for any local macro/function redefinitions of strcmp/strstr. If strcmp/strstr are replaced by nonstandard implementations, their behavior with regards to bounds/termination may differ and must be considered.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyst determine whether the pointers passed into strcmp and strstr are guaranteed to reference valid NUL-terminated objects (so the calls cannot access beyond object bounds) or whether there are call sites/return paths that can produce non-terminated or truncated buffers that would violate the MISRA rule."
