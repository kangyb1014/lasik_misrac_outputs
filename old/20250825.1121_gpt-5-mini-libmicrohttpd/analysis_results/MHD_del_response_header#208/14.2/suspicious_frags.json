  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No 'for' statements are present in the supplied function; the only loop construct is a while loop (while (NULL != pos)). MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for loops and their three clauses and the loop counter usage. Therefore there are no in-function code fragments that need investigation for compliance with Rule 14.2.\n\nNotes for completeness: any for-loops that might be relevant would have to appear in code outside this snippet (e.g. inside the functions called here such as del_response_header_connection(), MHD_get_response_element_n_(), or inside macros like MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ or MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ if they expand to loop constructs). Those external functions/macros are not part of the provided code and should be inspected separately if Rule 14.2 compliance is to be verified across the whole code base."
