  "explanation": "- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically forbids using the standard memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings. You must inspect all uses of memcmp to determine whether any call compares NUL-terminated strings related to MHD_str_quote inputs/outputs.\n- queue_auth_required_response3_inner: Direct caller of MHD_str_quote (in the static call graph). Inspect this function to see whether it passes NUL-terminated buffers into memcmp (or calls other functions that do).\n- MHD_queue_basic_auth_required_response3: Another direct caller of MHD_str_quote. Its code may compare the quoted/unquoted strings with memcmp or pass them to helpers that do.\n- MHD_add_response_header: Frequently works with header strings; callers may compare header names/values. Check whether it or its callers use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings produced by MHD_str_quote.\n- MHD_queue_response: Called by the callers above; may participate in string handling or comparisons downstream \u2014 include to trace any memcmp usage.\n- calculate_add_nonce_with_retry: Called by queue_auth_required_response3_inner and likely manipulates nonce/header strings; inspect for memcmp usages on NUL-terminated data.\n- digest_init_one_time, get_base_digest_algo, digest_get_size: These digest-related helpers are called from queue_auth_required_response3_inner and may perform comparisons on string identifiers or digests; include them to ensure no memcmp-on-string misuse occurs in the authentication path.\n- MHD_get_master: Accessor used in the caller chain; include to check whether master/credential lookups use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n- MHD_DLOG: Logging/out infrastructure sometimes formats or compares strings; include to ensure no hidden memcmp misuse in the logging path invoked by the callers.\n- MHD_queue_basic_auth_fail_response, ahc_echo, answer_to_connection: Higher-level callers of MHD_queue_basic_auth_required_response3 (from the call graph). Include them to trace upward call sites that might compare strings produced by MHD_str_quote with memcmp (i.e., to detect misuse elsewhere in the call chain).\n\nRationale: MHD_str_quote itself does not call memcmp, so to determine whether the MISRA rule is violated in practice you must inspect its callers and the functions they call (and any places memcmp is used) to see if the quoted/unquoted buffers are later compared with memcmp as NUL-terminated strings. The listed symbols cover the direct callers and the likely helper/dispatcher functions in their call paths plus the memcmp symbol that is the rule target."
