  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The fragment does not call any functions from <string.h> and performs explicit bounds reasoning: when entering the \u201cfast loop\u201d it has already tested that unquoted_len * 2 <= buf_size, so each iteration reads unquoted[r] only for r < unquoted_len and writes at most two bytes per input character to result (w increments by 1 or 2), so writes are bounded by 2 * unquoted_len \u2264 buf_size. Therefore this fragment does not cause accesses beyond the objects referenced by its pointer parameters.\n\nNote/caveat: the check uses unquoted_len * 2 which can overflow size_t for very large unquoted_len; such overflow could make the test unreliable and lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes in practice. That is a separate issue (integer overflow) and would be addressed by other MISRA rules, but it does not change the answer with respect to Rule 21.17 as applied to <string.h> functions (this fragment does not use them)."
