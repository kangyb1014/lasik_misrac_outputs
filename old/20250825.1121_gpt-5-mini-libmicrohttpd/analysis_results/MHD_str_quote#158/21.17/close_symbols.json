  "explanation": "- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: This preprocessor macro selects the fast path vs the small-code path. The fast path relies on the check `unquoted_len * 2 <= buf_size` to guarantee the output will fit and avoids per-character buffer-size checks; the small-code path performs per-character checks. To prove absence of out-of-bounds accesses (and that no string.h helpers are used), the exact value/presence of this macro is needed to know which branch compiles.\n\n- mhd_assert: The function calls `mhd_assert(w >= r)` and `mhd_assert(w <= r * 2)` at the end. The definition of mhd_assert (macro or function) is required to confirm it has no hidden side effects (e.g. calling string.h functions) and to ensure it does not change control flow or memory in a way that would affect the buffer-safety analysis.\n\n- size_t / SIZE_MAX: The code uses `size_t` and performs `unquoted_len * 2`. To reason about possible arithmetic overflow (which could invalidate the `unquoted_len * 2 <= buf_size` check) you need the width/limits of size_t (typically via SIZE_MAX). Determining whether the multiplication can wrap around is necessary to prove the fast-path check is sound and that no out-of-bounds memory access can occur.\n\nNote: MHD_str_quote does not call any functions from <string.h> (static call graph shows no callees). The symbols above are sufficient to (a) determine which code path is used and (b) rule out hidden string.h usage or arithmetic overflow that could undermine the buffer-size checks."
