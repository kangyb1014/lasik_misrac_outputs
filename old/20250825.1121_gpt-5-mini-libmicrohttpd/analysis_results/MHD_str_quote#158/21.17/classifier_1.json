  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment does not call any <string.h> functions and contains explicit bounds checks that prevent out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses: the loop condition ensures r < unquoted_len before reading unquoted[r], and before each write to result[] the code verifies buf_size > w (with an extra check after writing an escape char), so no write can index >= buf_size. Even buf_size == 0 is handled by the early return. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is not violated."
