  "explanation": "No calls to <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, etc.) are present in this function, so Rule 21.17\u2019s direct prohibition of misusing those library calls does not apply here. The remaining code reads from unquoted while r < unquoted_len (loop condition) and performs explicit buffer-size checks (buf_size <= w) before writes in the slow path, so those locations are not immediate candidates for out-of-bounds accesses. The mhd_assert macro is a no-op, so assert checks do not affect runtime behavior. The fragments flagged above are those that could still lead to out-of-bounds behavior and therefore merit investigation: (1) the unquoted_len * 2 comparison and the fast loop that writes without per-iteration bounds checks (susceptible to size_t overflow of the multiplication), (2) the quick-fail check if (unquoted_len > buf_size) which may be insufficient in combination with the previous check, and (3) the slow-loop escape/write sequence (to verify the correctness of the ordering of checks and increments). Other parts of the function perform explicit runtime bounds checks or are simple initializations/returns and thus do not need further investigation for potential accesses beyond object bounds."
