  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the submitted code. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or built-ins appear (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, __asm, __inline__, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or inline assembler).\n- Only standard preprocessor directives are used (#ifndef / #else / #endif) and a user macro (MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE) to select code paths; these are standard C preprocessing features, not compiler extensions.\n- The types and constructs are standard C (size_t, const, character literals, simple control flow and array indexing). The inner declaration \"const char chr = unquoted[r++];\" is a standard block-scope declaration in C99 and later (not a compiler extension).\n- The mhd_assert macro is defined as ((void)0), which is standard and not an extension.\n\nBecause none of the above extension-specific constructs are present, there are no code fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
