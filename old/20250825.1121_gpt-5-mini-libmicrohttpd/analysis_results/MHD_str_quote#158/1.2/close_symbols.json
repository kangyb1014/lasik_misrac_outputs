  "explanation": "MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: This preprocessor macro controls which code path is compiled. The macro definition (or how it is set via build flags) may enable alternative code that uses compiler extensions, so the exact definition is required to determine if any extension is used.\n\nmhd_assert: The function calls mhd_assert at the end. The definition of this macro/function must be inspected because assertion helpers commonly expand to compiler-specific builtins or attributes (for example to generate unreachable code, inline hints, or to call abort). If mhd_assert uses any compiler-specific extensions, that would violate the MISRA rule.\n\nsize_t: Although standard, the typedef for size_t can be provided by platform headers and in rare embedded toolchains could be implemented using non\u2011standard/extended language features. Verify that size_t comes from a standard header (stddef.h) and not a compiler extension.\n\n__builtin_unreachable: Common GCC/Clang builtin used by assert helpers to indicate unreachable code. Include this symbol to check whether any macros (notably mhd_assert) expand to this compiler extension.\n\n__builtin_expect: A GCC/Clang builtin used for branch prediction hints; assertion or debug macros sometimes use it. Include to check for such extension usage in macros called by this function.\n\n__attribute__: Compiler-specific function/variable attributes (GCC/Clang style) may appear in macro or function definitions used by this function. Check for any uses of __attribute__ in the definitions of mhd_assert or in headers activated by MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE.\n\nabort: Standard C function but often invoked by assert-like macros when failing; include to inspect whether assertion handling calls abort or uses other non\u2011standard termination helpers.\n\nNote: The critical items to inspect first are the definitions of MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE and mhd_assert. The builtin/attribute symbols are included because they are commonly used inside assert/debug macros and would be explicit language extensions if present."
