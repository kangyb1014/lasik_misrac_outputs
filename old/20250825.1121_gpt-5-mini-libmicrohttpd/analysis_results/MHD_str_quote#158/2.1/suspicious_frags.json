  "explanation": "I selected fragments that introduce conditional compilation and constant conditions (the #ifndef/#else region and the literal `if (1)`), plus both the fast-path and slow-path loops and the quick-fail/size-check statements. These constructs can produce code that is never reachable in some build configurations or that contains constant true conditions, so they should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). Other parts of the function are straightforward and do not appear to create unreachable code: the initializations (r = 0; w = 0;), the character-copy operations inside the loops (result[w++] = chr; and the escape insertion), the final assertions (mhd_assert (w >= r); mhd_assert (w <= r * 2);) and the return w; are reachable whenever the function does not return early via one of the size checks. No other unconditional returns or constant-false branches are present outside the fragments listed above, so they do not need investigation for unreachable-code issues."
