  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to decide MISRA C rule (Controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  - This preprocessor macro determines which branch of the function is compiled. In the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE path the code contains the literal controlling expression if (1) which is an invariant. Whether that invariant appears in the compiled binary (and therefore whether a potential MISRA violation exists) depends entirely on this macro's definition at compile time.\n\n- queue_auth_required_response3_inner\n  - This function is an immediate caller of MHD_str_quote (per the static call graph). To judge whether any controlling expression in MHD_str_quote can be effectively invariant in real builds, we must inspect the call sites in this caller: what values are passed for unquoted_len and buf_size (constant or computed once) and whether the caller ever calls MHD_str_quote with arguments that make expressions like (unquoted_len * 2 <= buf_size) or (unquoted_len > buf_size) trivially always true/false for all executions. If the caller always passes constant values that make a condition invariant, that affects the MISRA assessment.\n\n- MHD_queue_basic_auth_required_response3\n  - This is the other immediate caller of MHD_str_quote. Same reason as above: the actual arguments supplied here determine whether the controlling expressions that depend on parameters (unquoted_len, buf_size) can be invariant in practice.\n\n- MHD_queue_auth_required_response3\n  - This is a caller of queue_auth_required_response3_inner according to the call graph. If queue_auth_required_response3_inner receives arguments that are constants or otherwise invariant because of its own callers, the invariantness can cascade. Inspecting this symbol lets the analyser follow call chains to see whether arguments become invariant at higher call sites.\n\n- MHD_queue_basic_auth_fail_response, ahc_echo, answer_to_connection\n  - These are callers of MHD_queue_basic_auth_required_response3 (per the call graph). They are included so the analyzer can follow the call chain from external entry points to determine whether the values eventually supplied to MHD_str_quote are constant/invariant in practice. If any of these top-level call sites always provide the same buffer sizes/lengths, a controlling expression that depends only on those parameters could be effectively invariant.\n\nNotes\n- The function-local variables r and w are modified in the function, so their use in loop conditions (while (unquoted_len > r)) is not invariant by itself; the main potential invariant is the compile-time if (1) (controlled by MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE) and the possibility that callers always pass constant argument values. Therefore the macro and the relevant callers/call-chain must be inspected to conclude whether a MISRA violation exists."
