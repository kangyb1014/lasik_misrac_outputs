  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found w.r.t. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameters are:\n- const char *unquoted \u2014 correctly const-qualified since the function only reads from it.\n- char *result \u2014 correctly non-const because the function writes to the buffer.\nThere are no other pointer declarations or pointer-to-pointer parameters in the function; the local variable \"const char chr\" is not a pointer. No casts or conversions to/from non-const pointers occur in the shown code. Therefore no places need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
