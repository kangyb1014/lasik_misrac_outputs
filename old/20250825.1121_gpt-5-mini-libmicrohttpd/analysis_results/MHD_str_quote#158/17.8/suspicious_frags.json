  "explanation": "I examined all uses of the function parameters (unquoted, unquoted_len, result, buf_size). There are no assignments to any parameter variables and no pointer reassignments. The code writes through result (result[w++] = ...), which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter \u2014 this is allowed by the rule. The pointer variables themselves are never changed (no unquoted = ..., no result = ..., no unquoted++/result++), and scalar parameters unquoted_len and buf_size are only read (compared, multiplied) and not written. Loop indices r and w are local variables used for indexing and incremented; they are not function parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no fragments requiring further investigation for this rule."
