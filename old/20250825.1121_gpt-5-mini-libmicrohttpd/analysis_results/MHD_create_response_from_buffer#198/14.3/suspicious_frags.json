  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are obviously invariant at compile time. Details:\n\n- In MHD_create_response_from_buffer: the two if conditions (\"if (MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE == mode)\" and \"if (MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY == mode)\") compare the parameter 'mode' against enum constants. 'mode' is a function parameter and therefore not an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- In MHD_create_response_from_data: the conditions (\"if (0 != must_copy)\" and \"else if (0 != must_free)\") depend on the integer parameters must_copy and must_free, so they are not invariant.\n\n- In ahc_echo: the condition (\"if (0 != strcmp(method, \"GET\"))\") depends on the runtime value of 'method' and the result of strcmp, so it is not invariant.\n\n- There are no do/while or while loops with constant controlling expressions (no obvious \"while(1)\" or \"for(;;)\" infinite-loop constructs). The (void) casts are not controlling expressions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
