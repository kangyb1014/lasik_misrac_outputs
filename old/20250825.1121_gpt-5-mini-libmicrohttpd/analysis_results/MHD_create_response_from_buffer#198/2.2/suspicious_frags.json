  "explanation": "I limited the reported fragments to items that are plausibly \"dead\" (operations executed but whose removal would not change program behaviour) based on the provided code. The following parts of the code were examined and deemed not suspicious for Rule 2.2 and therefore not reported:\n\n- The NULL/size checks in MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (e.g. `if ((NULL == buffer) && (size > 0)) return NULL;` and the `MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN` check). These are defensive runtime checks that can change behaviour if removed.\n\n- The allocation and error-handling sequences (calls to MHD_calloc_, malloc, memcpy, checks for NULL, freeing on error). These are required runtime operations and removing them would alter program behaviour.\n\n- The mutex initialization and associated failure handling under MHD_USE_THREADS. Those are side-effectful and necessary for correct multi-threaded behaviour.\n\n- Assignments that initialize the response structure fields (fd, reference_count, total_size, data, data_size, crfc, crc_cls). They establish essential state; removing them would change behaviour.\n\n- The use of &free as the free-callback and passing the buffer as the callback class in MHD_create_response_from_buffer \u2014 this establishes the lifetime semantics for the buffer and is functional, not dead.\n\n- The callpaths in MHD_create_response_from_buffer that dispatch based on mode and return the appropriate response-construction function. Those are control-flow, not dead statements.\n\nThe fragments reported are: (1) the explicit early-return for size == 0 in MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy (could be redundant depending on malloc(0) behaviour and higher-level invariants), (2) the explicit assignment to r->data_buffer_size guarded by a TODO comment (the comment itself suggests the assignment may be obsolete), and (3) the repeated (void) parameter-cast lines in ahc_echo (they are no-op statements used to silence compiler warnings and do not affect runtime behaviour). These should be investigated to confirm whether they constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
