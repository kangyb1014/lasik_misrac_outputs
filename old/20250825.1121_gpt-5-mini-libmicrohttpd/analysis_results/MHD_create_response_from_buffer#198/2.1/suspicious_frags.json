  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Each conditional in MHD_create_response_from_buffer is reachable: the function handles the three defined enum values (MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_FREE, MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY, and the remaining case for MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT) so there is no code that cannot be executed. The first two if-statements return when true, and the final return serves as the fallback for the remaining valid enumerator or any other value; therefore no statements are statically unreachable under the provided definitions. No other parts of the function contain dead or unreachable code that would warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
