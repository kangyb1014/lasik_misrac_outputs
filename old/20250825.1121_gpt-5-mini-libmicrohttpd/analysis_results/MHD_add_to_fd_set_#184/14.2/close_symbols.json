  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA-C \"for loop shall be well-formed\" rule for MHD_add_to_fd_set_:\n\n- MHD_SCKT_FD_FITS_FDSET_SETSIZE_: This is a function-like macro or function called in the second control flow decision. Its implementation may contain for loops; the MISRA rule requires inspecting any for loops inside functions called from the code being analyzed because the behaviour of a for loop body includes called functions. We must inspect it to verify any for loops inside are well-formed and that they do not rely on or modify objects that this function also modifies.\n\n- MHD_SCKT_ADD_FD_TO_FDSET_SETSIZE_: This is invoked to add the descriptor to the fd_set. It likely manipulates fd_set and may use loops (e.g. to map socket numbers to fd_set bits). Any for loop here must be checked for clause well-formedness and for interactions with objects (fd, set, fd_setsize, max_fd) that are visible/modified in MHD_add_to_fd_set_.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef): The exact type (e.g. int, unsigned, custom) matters because loop counters and comparisons in called code could depend on width/signedness; MISRA's definition of loop counter and modifications can depend on type semantics. Also needed to see if assignments to *max_fd interact with any loops in callees.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: Its definition (value/macro) affects conditional branches and may be used inside called macros/functions; needed to understand control flow and whether called loops use this sentinel.\n\n- fd_set (type): The representation of fd_set matters because macros/functions that manipulate it (and may contain loops) will reference its internals. To check whether any for loops inside manipulated objects violate the rule (use of objects modified in the loop body, loop counters, etc.), the fd_set layout and access macros must be known.\n\n- FD_SET / FD_CLR / FD_ISSET / FD_ZERO (macros): Portable implementations sometimes implement these macros as loops or call helper inline functions. If MHD_SCKT_ADD_FD_TO_FDSET_SETSIZE_ or other code expands to these, we must inspect their implementations for any for loops and ensure those loops meet MISRA requirements and do not use/modify objects improperly.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE: This constant is used for fd_setsize and may be involved in loop bounds inside the fd-set manipulation macros/functions. Loop bounds and use of externally-modified objects are central to the MISRA for-loop rule, so the value/definition is required.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE (compile-time macro): This conditional controls whether fd_setsize is overwritten with FD_SETSIZE. That affects which code path is taken and therefore which called code (and any loops therein) must be checked. The macro determines if fd_setsize remains an external input or is normalized, which can affect loop counter usage in called code.\n\n- Definitions/implementations of any macros/functions used inside the two MHD_SCKT_* macros: The MHD_SCKT_* macros may in turn call or expand to other helper functions/macros that contain for loops. To fully determine compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule, you must inspect all nested implementations reachable from the two MHD_SCKT_* symbols to find any for loops and validate their three clauses and loop-counter usage relative to objects modified by MHD_add_to_fd_set_.\n\nNotes: MHD_add_to_fd_set_ itself contains no for loop; therefore the only possible MISRA violations relevant to this check can come from for loops inside called macros/functions or expanded macros used here. The items above are the minimal additional symbols/definitions required to perform that inspection."
