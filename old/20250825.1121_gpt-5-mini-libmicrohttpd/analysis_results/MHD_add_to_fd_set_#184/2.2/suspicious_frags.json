  "explanation": "I have listed fragments that are potentially executed but could be effectively no-ops or made redundant by configuration/macros and therefore merit investigation for dead-code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Other parts of the function are not listed because:\n- The function declaration, parameter list and outer braces are structural and cannot be \"dead code.\"\n- The parameter declarations themselves are initializations/definitions; per the rule note, initialization is not considered the same as an assignment and is not a candidate for dead code.\n- The control-flow checks (conditional returns) that were not listed are retained because they clearly influence execution paths (they cause early returns) and thus are not obviously removable without changing behavior.\n- Preprocessor directives and comments that do not produce executable statements were included only where they enable or disable the enclosed executable lines; otherwise they are not executable and therefore not candidates for 'dead code.'\n- Macro invocations were included where they appear in the code because they may expand to no-ops in some configurations; any other single-token identifiers or simple punctuation were omitted because they are either syntactic or obviously in-use.\nGiven only this translation unit, the listed fragments are those that most plausibly could be executed yet removable without changing behavior (e.g. no-op casts, assignments that may be redundant, macro expansions that can be empty, or always-true/always-false returns). Investigation should confirm actual macro expansions and call sites to determine whether these fragments are truly dead."
