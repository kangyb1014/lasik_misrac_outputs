  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they already use const-qualified pointer types or do not involve pointer-to-object const qualification issues. Specifically: 'const void *cls' and 'const char *mime' are already const-qualified; the (void) cls and (void) session statements merely suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not change pointer semantics; NOT_FOUND_ERROR is used as a string literal (an immutable object) and strlen() is a non-modifying operation; local scalar 'ret' and the fprintf() calls involve no pointer-to-object const qualification concerns. The listed suspicious fragments cover places where non-const pointer types are declared or passed and thus should be reviewed to determine whether the pointed-to types could/should be const-qualified."
