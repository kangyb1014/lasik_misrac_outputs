  "scenario": "The pointer is used as a mutable connection handle (it is passed to MHD_queue_response(connection,...)), so it must be a pointer to a non-const struct. Making it const would be incorrect if the called API modifies the connection state. If instead the connection is never modified by this code or by the called APIs, then omitting const would violate Rule 8.13, but given the use with MHD_queue_response the non-const declaration is appropriate."
