  "explanation": "To determine whether check_write_done participates in direct or indirect recursion you must analyze its caller(s) and any callees reachable from those callers that could call back into check_write_done. Reasons: \n- MHD_connection_handle_write: direct caller of check_write_done; any path from it back to check_write_done would create indirect recursion. \n- MHD_send_data_, MHD_DLOG, connection_close_error, MHD_update_last_activity_, MHD_send_hdr_and_body_, str_conn_error_, try_ready_normal_body, MHD_send_sendfile_, MHD_send_iovec_: all are listed callees of MHD_connection_handle_write and therefore must be examined because any of them (or functions they call) could call check_write_done, closing a recursion cycle. \n- __builtin_unreachable: present in the call graph as a callee of MHD_connection_handle_write (compiler builtin); include for completeness when surveying possible control-flow/back-edge sources. \n- call_handlers: caller of MHD_connection_handle_write; include to verify higher-level call paths that could produce a recursion cycle involving check_write_done."
