  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_write_done:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ncheck_write_done (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE next_state)\n{\n  if ( (connection->write_buffer_append_offset !=\n        connection->write_buffer_send_offset)\n       /* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */\n       )\n    return MHD_NO;\n  connection->write_buffer_append_offset = 0;\n  connection->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n  connection->state = next_state;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n/* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment is a commented-out condition (/* || data_in_tls_buffers == true */). As it is not compiled or executed, it is not an executed operation whose removal would or would not affect behaviour. Therefore it does not meet MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2's definition of dead code (executed but redundant). Note: commented-out code may be a maintenance issue but does not violate Rule 2.2."
