  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct under the stated assumptions. Rule 2.2 defines dead code as any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. In the scenario given, if: (a) connection->state already equals next_state at this point, and (b) connection->state is a non-volatile ordinary variable with no other observers (no other threads/ISRs, no memory-mapped side effects, no synchronization/timing dependence on the store), then the store connection->state = next_state; has no observable effect and its removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 therefore it qualifies as dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nCaveats: to conclude a project-level Rule 2.2 violation you must validate the whole-project context. If any of the excluded conditions are present (volatile, concurrent observers, memory-mapped side effects, or timing/synchronization effects of performing the write), then the assignment may have observable effects and would not be dead. A simple remediation is to guard the assignment (e.g. only write when the value differs) if there are no required side effects."
