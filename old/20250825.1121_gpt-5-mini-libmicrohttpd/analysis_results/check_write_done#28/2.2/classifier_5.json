  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_write_done:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ncheck_write_done (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE next_state)\n{\n  if ( (connection->write_buffer_append_offset !=\n        connection->write_buffer_send_offset)\n       /* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */\n       )\n    return MHD_NO;\n  connection->write_buffer_append_offset = 0;\n  connection->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n  connection->state = next_state;\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nconnection->write_buffer_send_offset = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the assignment is not provably dead. When write_buffer_append_offset and write_buffer_send_offset are equal, clearing only append_offset would leave send_offset non\u2011zero and could change subsequent behaviour. The assignment would only be dead if it can be proven that write_buffer_send_offset is never read (or is always overwritten) before any use after this function; no such proof is present in the fragment."
