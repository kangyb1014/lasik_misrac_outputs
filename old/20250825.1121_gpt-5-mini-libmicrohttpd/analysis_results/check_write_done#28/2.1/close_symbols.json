  "explanation": "To decide whether any code in check_write_done is provably unreachable you must know the types, possible values and update sites for the fields and the return/result values used in the function, and how callers set them. Each listed symbol is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: provides the declarations of the fields read and written by check_write_done. Without the struct definition you cannot determine the types, signedness, ranges or volatile/const qualifiers of the offsets or the semantics of the state field (all of which affect reachability analysis).\n\n- write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset: these specific fields are used in the conditional. You need their exact types and any invariants or annotations to determine whether the condition (append_offset != send_offset) can ever be true or false (and therefore whether either branch is unreachable).\n\n- state: the field assigned in the fall-through path. Its type/constraints matter if assigning next_state can be optimized away or if there are invariants that make the assignment unreachable.\n\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: the function returns these values. If the enum constants collapse to the same numeric value (or are defined in a way that makes one return equivalent to the other) that could affect whether a compiler or analyzer treats code as unreachable or redundant.\n\n- enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE: the type of next_state; needed to determine whether any casting/assignment behaviour or value-range constraints affect reachability or cause the assignment to be a no-op.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_write: the immediate caller. To prove that one branch in check_write_done is never taken you must examine how the caller prepares the connection object and what values it passes \u2014 the caller is the primary place those fields are set/updated before invocation.\n\n- MHD_send_data_, MHD_send_hdr_and_body_, MHD_send_sendfile_, MHD_send_iovec_: these routines (called from MHD_connection_handle_write per the static call graph) are likely sites that modify connection->write_buffer_append_offset and connection->write_buffer_send_offset (append/send bookkeeping). Examining their implementations is required to see whether they can produce states that make the conditional in check_write_done always true or always false.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any statement in check_write_done is unreachable in all program executions you must inspect the connection field declarations and types, the enum values used for returns and state, and the caller(s) and helper functions that initialize or update the relevant fields. The symbols above give the minimal set to perform that analysis."
