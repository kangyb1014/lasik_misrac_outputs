  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function in full. It contains no calls to memcmp or any other Standard Library string-comparison routines, and it performs only numeric comparisons of buffer offset members and simple assignments/returns. The commented-out identifier (/* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */) is inactive and does not invoke memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings), so no fragments need to be investigated."
