  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): The target function accesses members of this struct. To prove the function does not violate the memcmp rule you must know the actual types of the members (are they integer offsets, pointers to char, or something else) and whether any member is implemented via a macro that could expand to a memcmp-based comparison.\n\n- MHD_Connection::write_buffer_append_offset (member type/definition): The function compares this member against write_buffer_send_offset. If this member were a pointer to a NUL-terminated string (or a macro that resolves to a string comparison), that could indicate use of memcmp on strings. Knowing its exact type (e.g., size_t, ssize_t, off_t, char *, struct wrapper) is essential to conclude the comparison is numeric rather than a string comparison.\n\n- MHD_Connection::write_buffer_send_offset (member type/definition): Same reasoning as for write_buffer_append_offset \u2014 need the precise type/definition to ensure the != comparison is not actually comparing NUL-terminated strings via memcmp behind a macro or typedef.\n\n- MHD_Connection::state (member type/definition): The function assigns next_state into state. Confirming the state member's type (enum versus e.g. a char * or other type that could hide a string comparison) rules out hidden string comparisons or memcmp usage.\n\n- enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE (definition): To verify the assignment is between enum values (safe) and not between string-like types that might invoke or hide memcmp usage.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (definition) and constants MHD_YES, MHD_NO: The function returns these symbols. Their definitions must be confirmed to be plain enum/constants and not macros or functions that might internally call memcmp or perform string comparisons.\n\n- data_in_tls_buffers (symbol/definition, if present as a macro or global): Although this identifier is only present in a commented-out condition, verify whether it exists as a macro/global whose expansion could affect compiled code (or is re-enabled by preprocessing). If it is a macro that expands to a memcmp-based check, it could be relevant. If it is not present or only a simple boolean variable, it can be ignored.\n\nNote: The target source contains no explicit call to memcmp. The above symbols are required to rule out any hidden/indirect use of memcmp (for example via macros, typedefs, or surprising member types) and to confirm the comparisons and assignments are numeric/enum operations rather than string comparisons that would trigger the MISRA rule."
