  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Connection: REQUIRED \u2014 the function dereferences the parameter 'connection' and writes to its members (write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset, state). To decide if the pointer parameter could/should be const-qualified (MISRA: pointer should point to const when possible) you must know the exact types and qualifiers of those members: whether write_buffer_append_offset and write_buffer_send_offset are pointer types (e.g. char *) or scalar integers, and whether any members already carry const/volatile qualifiers. The full struct definition (member types and qualifiers) is therefore essential. 2) enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE: REQUIRED \u2014 the function assigns next_state to connection->state. You need the enum/type definition to confirm state is not a pointer type (so that assigning it implies mutation of the pointed object vs. only reading), and to check whether any typedefs/qualifiers affect const-qualification reasoning. 3) enum MHD_Result: REQUIRED \u2014 the function returns MHD_YES/MHD_NO values of this enum type. Including the enum/type definition is useful to confirm these are plain non-pointer return values and to rule out any hidden pointer typedefs or qualifiers affecting the const-pointer analysis."
