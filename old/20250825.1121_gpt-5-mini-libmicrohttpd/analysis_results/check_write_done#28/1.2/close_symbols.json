  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions of the types and constants it uses, because extensions will typically appear there rather than in this small function body. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): The function accesses members write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset and state. You must see the struct definition to detect any use of compiler extensions (anonymous/unnamed structs or unions, zero-length arrays, flexible array members with non-standard syntax, __attribute__ annotations, packed/aligned attributes, GCC/Clang-specific bit-field widths, typeof(), extension pragmas, or other non\u2011standard language constructs applied to the type or its members).\n\n- enum MHD_Result (full definition): The return type could be an enum defined using non\u2011standard extensions (e.g., attributes, compiler pragmas, or vendor-specific enum extensions). Inspecting its definition also reveals whether MHD_YES/MHD_NO are enum constants or macros, and whether any extensions are used there.\n\n- enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE (full definition): The function assigns to connection->state; check this enum's definition for any compiler-specific constructs or attributes that would constitute language extensions.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: These identifiers are used as return values. They may be enum constants or macros. You must see their definitions to ensure they are standard C and not implemented via compiler extensions or macro tricks.\n\n- MHD connection header file(s) where the above are declared: Provide the header(s) that declare/define the above symbols so the analyzer can inspect any file\u2011level or macro\u2011level constructs (e.g., #pragma, __extension__, compiler-specific macros) that would indicate use of language extensions.\n\nNo other symbols from the static call graph are required because this function makes no calls; the only potential sources of language extensions are the type/constant definitions it uses."
