  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses standard C constructs only: a file\u2011scope static function, enum types for return and parameter, pointer to a struct, standard if statement with equality/inequality operators, block comments, assignments of integer zero, and returns of what appear to be enum/macro constants. There are no compiler-specific extensions present (no __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly, designated initializers with nonstandard syntax, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, computed gotos, or other documented vendor extensions). The commented-out expression (/* || data_in_tls_buffers == true  */) is just a comment and not an extension. Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
