  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the provided function. The only controlling expression is the if-condition:\n\n(connection->write_buffer_append_offset != connection->write_buffer_send_offset)\n\nThis depends on two members of the runtime connection object (non-constant, input-dependent) and therefore is not invariant. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch controlling expressions in this function. The commented-out subexpression (/* || data_in_tls_buffers == true */) is not active code and thus cannot make the controlling expression invariant; if that were enabled, it would need separate review to confirm whether data_in_tls_buffers is a non-constant runtime value. All assignments and return statements are not controlling expressions and so do not fall under Rule 14.3. Therefore no code fragments in this function require further investigation for Rule 14.3 compliance."
