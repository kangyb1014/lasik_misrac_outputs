  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression (connection->write_buffer_append_offset != connection->write_buffer_send_offset) is invariant (and thus violates MISRA C), we must know whether those fields can change at runtime and whether the compiler can treat them as constants. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): needed to see the exact member declarations and to find associated concurrency/locking members and related fields (like state). Without the full struct we cannot determine field types or qualifiers.\n\n- declaration/type/qualifiers of write_buffer_append_offset and write_buffer_send_offset: crucial to determine if the members are const, volatile, atomic (_Atomic), or plain scalars. If they are const or compile-time constants the expression could be invariant. If volatile or atomic or changed under locks, the expression is not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- all assignments (write-sites) to those two fields: to prove the expression can vary at runtime we must examine every place in the codebase that modifies these members. If the members are only ever written to fixed values at initialization and never changed, the expression could be invariant.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_write and the listed send/handler functions from the call graph (MHD_send_data_, MHD_send_hdr_and_body_, MHD_send_sendfile_, MHD_send_iovec_, try_ready_normal_body): these functions are immediate callers/callees in the same control region and are likely places that read/modify the write buffer offsets. Inspecting their definitions will show whether they mutate the fields before/after check_write_done is invoked.\n\n- connection initialization / reset / destructor functions: offsets may be set to 0 or other values during setup/teardown; knowing those sites is necessary to reason about invariance over the program lifetime.\n\n- declaration of data_in_tls_buffers and macros that control it: the source shows that the expression previously included '|| data_in_tls_buffers == true' commented out. If that symbol can be enabled via compile-time flags, its presence/qualification (volatile/atomic) could change whether the controlling expression is invariant.\n\n- declarations/definitions of locking/concurrency primitives associated with the connection: if offsets are guarded by locks or updated from other threads (or via asynchronous callbacks), the expression is not an invariant even if values rarely change. Conversely, absence of concurrency and lack of other writes would support a claim of invariance.\n\n- relevant compile-time configuration macros: some build options may change member types or include/exclude code paths (e.g., TLS support), which affects whether the controlling expression can vary.\n\nCollecting those symbols (the struct and member declarations, all write-sites, the caller/send functions, any global flag like data_in_tls_buffers, and concurrency/signalling primitives and config macros) gives the information necessary to determine if the controlling expression is truly invariant at compile-time or across program execution, and therefore whether the code violates the MISRA rule."
