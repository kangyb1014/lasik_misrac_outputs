  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Connection (full definition): needed to see the exact declarations and types of the members referenced (write_buffer_append_offset, write_buffer_send_offset, state). The MISRA rule distinguishes modifying the pointer parameter itself from modifying the object it points to; knowing these members' declarative form (e.g. whether any of them are implemented as macros, bitfields, or have accessor semantics) is required to conclude that the code modifies the object pointed to (permitted) rather than the parameter itself (forbidden).\n\n2) enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE (definition): required to confirm that next_state is a by-value enum parameter (not a macro or typedef to a pointer or reference-like type). If next_state were actually a macro or alias to something that permits modification, that could affect whether the parameter is being modified.\n\n3) enum MHD_Result (definition) and the MHD_YES / MHD_NO enumerators: required to ensure those return tokens are plain enum constants (not functions/macros with side effects) and to confirm no hidden modification of function parameters occurs via their use. This verifies that returning MHD_NO / MHD_YES does not alter parameters."
