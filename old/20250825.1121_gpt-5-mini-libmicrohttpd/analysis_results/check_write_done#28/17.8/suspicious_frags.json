  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The rule forbids modifying parameter variables themselves (e.g., reassigning the pointer parameter or assigning to the value parameter). In this function: - The pointer parameter 'connection' is not reassigned or modified as a variable; only members of the object it points to are written (connection->write_buffer_append_offset, connection->write_buffer_send_offset, connection->state). MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 explicitly permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter. - The value parameter 'next_state' is only read and not assigned to. - The initial comparison uses the parameters but does not modify them. Therefore no code fragment in this function appears to violate Rule 17.8."
