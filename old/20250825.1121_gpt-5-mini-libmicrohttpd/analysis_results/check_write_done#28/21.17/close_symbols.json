  "explanation": "To decide whether check_write_done can contribute to out-of-bounds accesses by string.h functions you must know the concrete layout, types and bounds of the write buffer and how offsets are used elsewhere. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): the function manipulates members of this struct; the full definition gives exact member names, types and any other fields that affect buffer bounds and lifetime.\n- connection->write_buffer (member): the actual buffer pointer that any memcpy/memmove/strlen/etc. would read from or write to; required to check pointer validity and object size.\n- connection->write_buffer_append_offset and connection->write_buffer_send_offset (members and their types): the function compares and resets these offsets; their integer type (size_t, uint32_t, etc.) and signedness affect arithmetic/overflow/bounds checks.\n- connection->write_buffer_size / capacity member: the capacity/length field that bounds valid values of the offsets; without it you cannot determine whether offsets are within the buffer.\n- enum MHD_Result and enum MHD_CONNECTION_STATE: definitions are needed to understand return values and state transitions (may affect subsequent code paths that perform string.h operations).\n- MHD_connection_handle_write (implementation): caller of check_write_done; needed to see how offsets and the connection are used before/after check_write_done and to find any string.h calls that rely on the offsets being zero or equal.\n- MHD_send_data_, MHD_send_hdr_and_body_, MHD_send_sendfile_, MHD_send_iovec_, try_ready_normal_body (implementations/prototypes): these functions appear in the connection write path and are likely to perform buffer copies or I/O that use the offsets. Their source shows whether they call memcpy/memmove/memset/strlen/strcpy/etc. and whether they validate offsets against buffer bounds.\n- data_in_tls_buffers (global variable): commented condition in the target suggests TLS buffer state affects behavior; its meaning affects whether check_write_done should defer, which changes when other functions operate on the buffer.\n- Any macros/constants used to allocate/limit the write buffer (e.g. WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE): allocation or compile-time size limits are necessary to prove offsets do not exceed object bounds.\n\nCollecting these symbols allows an analyzer to (1) determine the valid range of the offsets, (2) find all call sites that use the offsets to perform memory operations with standard string.h functions, and (3) verify that those calls are correctly bounded so no access can go beyond the underlying object."
