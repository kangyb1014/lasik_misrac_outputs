  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_run_from_select (which simply forwards to MHD_run_from_select2) can lead to any out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses from string.h calls you must inspect the code that actually does the work. For that you need:\n\n- MHD_run_from_select2 (definition/prototype): the immediate callee \u2014 its implementation must be scanned for any usage of memcpy/memmove/memset/strlen/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/memcmp/strspn and for the lengths/arguments passed to them.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition) \u2014 at least fields fdset_size_set_by_app and fdset_size: MHD_run_from_select conditionally chooses the fdset size from these fields; that value may affect buffer lengths or loop bounds inside MHD_run_from_select2 or its callees, so you must know their types and semantics to validate bounds checks.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE (macro / value): used when the daemon has not overridden the fd_set size; the actual numeric value can affect sizing logic in downstream code and therefore whether string/memory operations are bounded correctly.\n\n- fd_set type definition (platform headers): the code passes fd_set pointers into MHD_run_from_select2; knowledge of the fd_set layout/size can be required if callees perform raw memory operations or compute sizes using FD_SETSIZE, etc.\n\n- MHD_DLOG, MHD_epoll, MHD_cleanup_connections, resume_suspended_connections, internal_run_from_select (definitions/implementations): these are the functions called by MHD_run_from_select2 according to the static call graph. Each implementation must be examined for any string.h function calls (direct or indirect). For each found call you must inspect the arguments (buffer pointers and lengths) and any related structures/variables they use to confirm accesses are within the referenced objects' bounds.\n\n(If any of the listed functions call further helpers that use string.h, those helpers and any global variables/macros they depend on will also need to be included in the analysis \u2014 start with the above and expand as string.h usages are discovered.)"
