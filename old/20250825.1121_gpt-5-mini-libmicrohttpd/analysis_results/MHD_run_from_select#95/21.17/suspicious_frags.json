  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The provided code fragment contains no calls to any of these functions. It only forwards fd_set pointer arguments and an unsigned int size to MHD_run_from_select2, and uses a preprocessor conditional and a cast; there are no string operations, no buffer copies, and no explicit memory/length calculations that could cause out-of-bounds accesses via the listed string functions. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.17."
