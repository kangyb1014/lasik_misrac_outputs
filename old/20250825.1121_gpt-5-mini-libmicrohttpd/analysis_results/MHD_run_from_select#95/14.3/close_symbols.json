  "explanation": "Symbols required and why:\n\n- MHD_run_from_select2\n  Reason: The target function is a thin wrapper that immediately calls MHD_run_from_select2 and forwards the computed fdset-size argument. To determine whether any controlling expression (in this function or as a consequence of the forwarded value) is invariant or leads to an invariant controlling expression in surrounding constructs, the callee must be inspected (e.g., if MHD_run_from_select2 uses the passed size in loops/conditions).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon\n  Reason: The ternary controlling expression tests a member of this struct (daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app). Understanding the type qualifiers, declaration (mutable/const/volatile), and semantics of the struct is necessary to determine whether the tested field is invariant.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon::fdset_size_set_by_app\n  Reason: This specific member is the direct condition of the ternary operator. We must know its type (e.g., boolean/int), storage class, and whether it can change at runtime (is it const, macro-defined, or written elsewhere) to decide if the controlling expression is potentially invariant.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon::fdset_size\n  Reason: This member is the alternative value used when fdset_size_set_by_app is true. Its mutability/definition may affect whether the overall expression is invariant (for example, if both branches are compile-time constants). Also useful to check whether its value influences any controlling expression in the callee.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n  Reason: Conditional compilation selects between two forms of the argument. Knowing whether this macro is defined controls which expression is compiled and therefore whether the controlling expression is invariant (if the overridable branch is disabled the code may pass only a compile-time constant).\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE\n  Reason: This macro supplies a compile-time constant fallback value when fdset-size overridability is not used. If the compiled branch always uses this constant (because HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is not defined or fdset_size_set_by_app is effectively constant), the expression passed becomes invariant; its value and definition are needed to judge invariance.\n\n(These symbols are the minimal set directly referenced by MHD_run_from_select. They let the analyzer determine whether the conditional/ternary expression is variable at runtime or resolves to a compile-time invariant, and to inspect the callee for any controlling expressions that depend on the forwarded value.)"
