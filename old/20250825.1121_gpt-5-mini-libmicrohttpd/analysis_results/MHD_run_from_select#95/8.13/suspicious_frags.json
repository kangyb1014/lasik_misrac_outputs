  "explanation": "The only non-const pointer parameter in this snippet is the daemon parameter; its declaration and uses are listed above for further investigation. The other pointer parameters (read_fd_set, write_fd_set, except_fd_set) are already const-qualified in the function signature so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 8.13. The conditional compilation and the integer casts involve no pointer types and therefore are not relevant to the const-qualification requirement. The function return type and enum usage are not pointer-related and likewise do not need inspection for this rule."
