  "explanation": "- MHD_run_from_select2: The target function only forwards its arguments to MHD_run_from_select2. To decide whether MHD_run_from_select could (or must) declare its pointer parameters as const, we must know the parameter types/qualifiers MHD_run_from_select2 requires and whether its body modifies the daemon or the fd_set arguments.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: The target function dereferences daemon (daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app and daemon->fdset_size in the conditional). You must see the daemon structure to confirm which fields are read/modified and their types; that determines whether daemon can be a pointer-to-const in this function and whether passing it on to downstream functions would require removing const.\n\n- fd_set typedef/definition: The function takes const fd_set * parameters and forwards them. Knowing the concrete fd_set type and how it may be used by MHD_run_from_select2 (or deeper callees) is necessary to determine whether the pointer can/should be const-qualified.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE and _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE: The conditional expression in the call depends on this macro and on daemon fields. Knowing whether the daemon fields are actually accessed (macro defined or not) and the nature of the constant affects whether daemon is only read (permitting const) or is required for other operations.\n\n- Prototypes/definitions of functions called by MHD_run_from_select2 that accept struct MHD_Daemon * or fd_set * (internal_run_from_select, resume_suspended_connections, MHD_epoll, MHD_cleanup_connections, MHD_DLOG, etc.): Even if MHD_run_from_select itself only reads daemon and receives const fd_set pointers, it cannot be made const-correct if it must pass a (potentially) const-qualified pointer to a callee that requires a non-const pointer (which would force a qualifier discard). To conclude whether MHD_run_from_select can/should use const, you must inspect MHD_run_from_select2 and any downstream callees that receive those pointers to see whether any of them require modification of the pointed-to objects."
