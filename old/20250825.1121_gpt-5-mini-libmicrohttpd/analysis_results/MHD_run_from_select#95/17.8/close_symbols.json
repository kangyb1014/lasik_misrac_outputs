  "explanation": "Why each is required:\n\n- MHD_run_from_select2: The target function's body is a single call to MHD_run_from_select2. We must fetch its declaration/definition to ensure it is not a macro/inline that expands into code that would modify any of MHD_run_from_select's parameters (i.e. a surprising in-place replacement would violate the MISRA rule at the call site).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition: fields fdset_size_set_by_app, fdset_size): The function dereferences the daemon pointer and reads daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app and daemon->fdset_size. The struct layout and types are needed to confirm these are reads (not via accessor macros that perform assignments) and to ensure no hidden modification of the daemon parameter itself occurs.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE (preprocessor macro): The conditional compilation around the ternary expression selects different code paths. To know exactly which code is compiled and whether any path could modify parameters, the macro definition (or build configuration) must be known.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE (macro/constant): This macro is used in the argument list (cast to unsigned int). Knowing its definition ensures it is a simple constant and not an expression or macro that could perform assignments or side effects affecting parameters.\n\n- fd_set (typedef/definition): The read_fd_set/write_fd_set/except_fd_set parameters are of type fd_set*. Confirming the fd_set typedef/implementation (or any wrapper macros) rules out that passing these arguments involves hidden modifications (e.g. weird macro wrappers) and verifies these parameters themselves are not being assigned within the target function.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether MHD_run_from_select itself performs any assignment to its parameters or expands (via macros/inline) into code that would do so. Additional callees of MHD_run_from_select2 are not required for checking whether the target function's own parameters are modified (but MHD_run_from_select2 must be inspected only to rule out macro/inline expansion at the call site)."
