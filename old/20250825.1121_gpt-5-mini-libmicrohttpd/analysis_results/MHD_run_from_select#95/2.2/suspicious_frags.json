  "explanation": "The only code region that could contain dead code is the selection of the fdset size (the conditional compilation block and the ternary expression that chooses between daemon->fdset_size and _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE). That selection may contain branches that are never taken in the project configuration (e.g. if HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is always/never defined, or if daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app is always the same value), and therefore those branches warrant investigation for Rule 2.2.\n\nOther fragments in the function are not flagged because they are straightforward and necessary for correct behaviour: the function signature and return type define the public API; the call to MHD_run_from_select2 is the intended forwarding action (not obviously removable without changing behaviour); the parameter list and surrounding braces are syntactic necessities. There is no unreachable code elsewhere in this small function, and no plain assignments or operations that appear removable without changing behavior, so they do not need investigation for dead code in this context."
