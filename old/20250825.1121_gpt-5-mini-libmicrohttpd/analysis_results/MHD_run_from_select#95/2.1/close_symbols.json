  "explanation": "Required symbols and why:\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE: The target function contains a preprocessor #ifdef around two alternative argument expressions. Whether that macro is defined decides which source text is compiled; to determine if any branch in the function is unreachable you must know the macro's definition state at compile time.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE: The compiled argument (when HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is not set, or as the alternative) is this macro; its presence/value is needed to see which literal/constant code is actually emitted and whether any expressions become constant (and thus could make other code unreachable).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition) and its fields fdset_size_set_by_app and fdset_size: When HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is defined the function uses daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app and daemon->fdset_size in a conditional expression. You must inspect the struct to confirm these members exist and their types (and to reason about whether any of those members are compile-time constants or otherwise render code unreachable).\n\n- MHD_run_from_select2 (declaration/definition or macro expansion): The target simply returns the result of calling MHD_run_from_select2. That symbol may be a function or a macro that expands into additional code; its definition is required to determine whether the call site in the target function contains any code that will be eliminated or made unreachable by expansion or by constant folding.\n\n- MHD_DLOG, MHD_epoll, MHD_cleanup_connections, resume_suspended_connections, internal_run_from_select: These are the static callees of MHD_run_from_select2. To decide whether any code in the target function is effectively unreachable in the whole program you often must inspect the body of MHD_run_from_select2 (and its callees) because e.g. the callee could be inlined, could contain compile-time constant branches, or the call chain could reveal that certain return paths or argument evaluations in the caller are never used. Including these symbols allows the next analyst to inspect the called code paths for any code that the target function could never reach at runtime or that the compiler will remove.\n\nProvide these definitions to the next agent so it can evaluate which source branches are actually compiled and whether any statements in the target function are provably unreachable under the project's configuration and build-time macros."
