  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Reasons:\n- The function contains a single return statement that directly calls MHD_run_from_select2; there is no code following the return that would be unreachable.\n- The #ifdef / #else blocks govern which argument expression is compiled. Only one branch is present in any given translation unit, so the uncompiled branch is not \"unreachable\" in the sense of executable code \u2014 it simply is not part of the translation unit. MISRA Rule 2.1 targets code that cannot be executed within the built program, not preprocessor-excluded text.\n- The ternary operator (daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app ? ... : ...) is evaluated at runtime; both subexpressions are potentially reachable depending on the runtime value, so neither is statically unreachable.\n- There are no constant conditions or control-flow constructs in this snippet that would render any compiled statement unreachable.\nTherefore, no fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the provided code."
