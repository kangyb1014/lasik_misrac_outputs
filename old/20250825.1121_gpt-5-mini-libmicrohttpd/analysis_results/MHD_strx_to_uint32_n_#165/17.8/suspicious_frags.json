  "explanation": "No function parameters are modified in this code. The parameters are: const char *str, size_t maxlen, and uint32_t *out_val. The pointer out_val is used only to store the result via *out_val = res, which modifies the object pointed to (permitted by Rule 17.8); the pointer out_val itself is not reassigned or incremented. The parameters str and maxlen are only read (str is const-qualified and indexed, maxlen is compared) and are not modified. All other mutations (res, i) are local variables. Therefore there are no fragments that violate or need investigation for Rule 17.8."
