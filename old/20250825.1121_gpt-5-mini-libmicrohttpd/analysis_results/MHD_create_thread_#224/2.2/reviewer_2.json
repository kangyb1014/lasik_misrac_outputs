Violation scenario: if mhd_assert is a diagnostic macro that expands to nothing in production (for example #define mhd_assert(x) ((void)0) or assert() under NDEBUG) and MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_valid_handle_(*) has no side effects, then the assertion performs no functional action and its removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 therefore it is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the scenario they describe. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids code that is executed but whose removal would not change program behaviour. If mhd_assert is a diagnostic macro that becomes a no\u2011op in production (for example expands to ((void)0) or is removed under NDEBUG) and the predicate MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_valid_handle_() has no observable side effects, then the assertion statement performs no functional action and its removal would not affect behaviour \u2014 i.e. it is dead code. In that configuration the report is a valid Rule 2.2 violation. If, however, mhd_assert performs an observable action (logging, abort, etc.) or the predicate has side effects, then the statement is not dead code and no Rule 2.2 violation occurs. Recommended remediation: ensure required runtime checks are not implemented solely with assertions that can be compiled out, or make the check have observable effects when it must remain in production code."
