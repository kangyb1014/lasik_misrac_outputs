  "explanation": "You must inspect the implementations and relevant type info for each of these symbols to determine whether any code reachable from run_usock uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule). Reasons: \n\n- ws_receive_frame: run_usock receives msg from this function; you need its implementation and contract (is msg a NUL\u2011terminated C string?) and to check whether it itself calls memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- ws_send_frame: run_usock calls this to send text; inspect its body for any memcmp usage (it may compare payloads or headers) and to see whether it treats its input as a NUL\u2011terminated string.\n\n- send_all: ws_send_frame calls send_all (per the call graph). Inspect send_all for any memcmp usage or comparisons involving buffers that may be NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- make_blocking: present in call chain (called by run_usock and send_all). Include its implementation in case it or helper code uses memcmp on string data.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: called at function end; its implementation (and callees) must be checked for memcmp usage (the graph shows it calls MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_).\n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: callee of MHD_upgrade_action; include to check for memcmp usage in that path.\n\n- memcmp: include the symbol so the analyzer can search directly for all uses of memcmp across these functions/modules and inspect argument origins (to determine whether the arguments are NUL\u2011terminated strings).\n\n- struct WsData: run_usock accesses ws->urh and ws->sock and passes ws->sock and msg to callees; the struct definition (and any accompanying documentation) is needed to understand ownership and whether returned/used buffers are NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next agent trace all code reachable from run_usock that could invoke memcmp and determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings (thus checking for a MISRA violation)."
