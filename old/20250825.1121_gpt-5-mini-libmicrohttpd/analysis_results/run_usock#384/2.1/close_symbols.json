  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if any code in run_usock is unreachable:\n\n- struct WsData: Defines fields accessed by run_usock (at least ws->sock and ws->urh). Needed to know whether those fields can be NULL/invalid or have side effects that make certain branches unreachable.\n\n- MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: Type of ws->urh; required to understand any side effects of calling MHD_upgrade_action and whether that influences control flow or reachability of code following it.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME: Constant used in the type comparison. To determine if the text-frame branch can ever be taken (or is statically impossible) we must know its definition/value and relation to values produced by ws_receive_frame.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: Constant for connection-close opcode. Needed to judge whether the close-branch is possible or statically impossible (unreachable).\n\n- ws_receive_frame: Prototype and semantics (possible return values, whether it can set type to what values, whether it can block, longjmp, or always return NULL). This function controls the main branch selection (text vs close vs NULL) and therefore directly affects reachability of the branches inside the loop.\n\n- ws_send_frame: Prototype and semantics (return values, whether it calls send_all, whether it can block indefinitely or never return, whether it can abort/process exit). Its behavior determines whether subsequent code (free(msg), break, loop continuation) can be reached.\n\n- send_all: Called (transitively) by ws_send_frame per the call graph. Required to know if it can loop forever, terminate the process, or always return, which affects reachability of code after ws_send_frame.\n\n- make_blocking: Called at start; needed to know whether it can fail, block forever, or not return (e.g., abort/exit), which would make the rest of run_usock unreachable.\n\n- recv: The socket receive primitive used to drive the while loop. Its return-value semantics (possible blocking/return values, errno behavior) determine whether the loop can exit and thus whether code after the loop is reachable.\n\n- MUTEX: The mutex object used in the final cleanup critical section. Its definition and initialization state can affect whether pthread_mutex_lock succeeds or returns an error path (which calls abort), affecting reachability of the cleanup code.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock: Behavior/return values are inspected (code aborts on non-zero). To determine if the cleanup code after the loop is reachable, we must know whether lock can legitimately return non-zero in this build/environment.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock: Behavior/return values are inspected similarly; unlock could abort() on failure and thereby affect reachability of code following the unlock.\n\n- abort: The code calls abort() on mutex errors. If abort has been replaced/overridden or has non-standard behavior, reachability of later code must be re-evaluated.\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS: Global array scanned in the cleanup loop. Its type/size and possible contents are needed to know whether the loop body can be entered and whether assignments inside it are reachable.\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS: Size bound for the CLIENT_SOCKS loop. Needed to determine if the for-loop is executed zero times (making that loop body unreachable) or not.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: Value stored into CLIENT_SOCKS[i]; needed to understand whether that assignment is reachable/useful and whether comparisons with ws->sock can ever match.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: Called at function end. We must know whether it returns normally or can terminate the thread/process (or longjmp) because that affects reachability of any code after the call (and whether the call itself is reachable under various inputs).\n\nThese symbols collectively define the control-flow and possible side effects (blocking, termination, return-value ranges) that are necessary to determine whether any branch or statement in run_usock can never be executed (i.e., is unreachable) under the project's definitions and platform."
