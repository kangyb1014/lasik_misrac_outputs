  "explanation": "To determine whether run_usock violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls we must inspect all functions it calls and their transitive callees (any function in a call chain that could lead back to run_usock). The static graph shows the following relevant symbols:\n\n- make_blocking: direct callee of run_usock (and of send_all). Its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not call run_usock (directly or via other functions).\n- send_all: direct callee of run_usock (via ws_send_frame as well). It is a transitive node; inspect it because it could call functions that eventually call run_usock.\n- ws_send_frame: direct callee of run_usock and caller of send_all. Its body may call other functions that could lead back to run_usock.\n- ws_receive_frame: direct callee of run_usock. Must be checked for any calls that could reach run_usock.\n- MHD_upgrade_action: direct callee of run_usock. Its implementation may call other MHD internals that could (directly or indirectly) call run_usock.\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: shown as a callee of MHD_upgrade_action in the static graph; inspect it because it is a transitive callee and might call back into application code including run_usock.\n\nInspecting these symbols (and any additional callees they reference) will establish whether any call chain starting from run_usock can eventually call run_usock again (directly or indirectly)."
