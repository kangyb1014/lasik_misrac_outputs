Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To decide if the for loop \"for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)\" is MISRA well-formed you must know whether any of the objects used in the three clauses are modified by the loop body (including by any function called there) or whether the identifiers expand to expressions with side effects. The listed symbols are required for that check:\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS: the second clause uses MAX_CLIENTS. We must know if it is a compile-time constant (macro/enum/const) or a modifiable variable (or a macro that expands to an expression with side effects). If MAX_CLIENTS can be modified (or its expansion has side-effects), the second-clause requirement would be violated.\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS: the loop body writes CLIENT_SOCKS[i]. We need the declaration/type/definition of CLIENT_SOCKS to determine whether it is a plain array/object (single identifier) or a macro/function-like expression (which might introduce side effects or mean the second/third clause references an object modified in the body). Also need to know if CLIENT_SOCKS is declared volatile/atomic or otherwise aliased to objects used in the loop clauses.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: assigned into CLIENT_SOCKS[i] inside the body. We need its definition to ensure it is a simple constant (no side-effects) and that the assignment does not indirectly affect the loop counter or other objects used in the loop clauses.\n\n- struct WsData (definition, specifically the type of ws->sock): the body compares CLIENT_SOCKS[i] to ws->sock. We must confirm ws->sock is a distinct object (type, not an alias to the loop counter) and that its access has no side effects (e.g., implemented as a macro or accessor function). This ensures the loop counter i is not modified via aliasing and that the loop body does not implicitly alter objects referenced in the clauses.\n\n(Other local items such as the loop counter 'i' are visible in the function body. No functions are called inside the loop body, so no further callee definitions are required for this specific MISRA for-loop clause analysis.)"
