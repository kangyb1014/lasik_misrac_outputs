  "explanation": "No controlling expressions requiring investigation were found. The only invariant-looking loop is while (1), which is an intentionally constructed infinite loop that uses break to exit; this falls under the Rule 14.3 exception allowing invariants used to create infinite loops, so it need not be investigated. All other controlling expressions are variant at runtime and therefore not suspects:\n- if (0 >= got): depends on recv() result (variable got).\n- if (NULL == msg): depends on ws_receive_frame() result (variable msg).\n- if (type == WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME) and the nested if (type == WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME): both depend on the runtime value of type.\n- if (0 < buf_size): buf_size is computed at runtime via snprintf(NULL,...).\n- if (NULL != text): depends on malloc() result.\n- if (snprintf(...) == buf_size): depends on snprintf() return value.\n- if (-1 == sent): depends on ws_send_frame()/error branches.\n- for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++): the loop control depends on the loop variable i (not invariant), even though MAX_CLIENTS is a constant.\n- if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock(&MUTEX)) and if (0 != pthread_mutex_unlock(&MUTEX)): depend on the return values of the mutex functions.\n\nBecause each of these expressions can vary at runtime (or is permitted as an intentional infinite loop), there are no additional fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 compliance."
