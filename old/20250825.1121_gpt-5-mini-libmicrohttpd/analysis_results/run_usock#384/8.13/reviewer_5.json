True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe pointer 'msg' is declared as 'unsigned char *msg' but is only used for read-only access (assigned from ws_receive_frame, passed to snprintf/format and ws_send_frame, never written). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer that is only used to read data should be const-qualified (e.g. 'const unsigned char *msg'). Thus the current non-const declaration violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function run_usock:\nstruct WsData\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh;\n  MHD_socket sock;\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Although 'msg' is only read (not written) in run_usock, it is also the ownership pointer returned by ws_receive_frame and is explicitly freed later with free(msg). Making 'msg' a pointer-to-const would prevent passing it to free without casting away the qualifier (free takes void *), which would either require an unsafe cast or changing ownership semantics. MISRA's \u201cwhenever possible\u201d intent does not mandate adding const qualifiers when doing so would conflict with ownership (deallocation) or require casting away qualifiers. Therefore the current non-const declaration is justified and does not violate Rule 8.13 in this context."
