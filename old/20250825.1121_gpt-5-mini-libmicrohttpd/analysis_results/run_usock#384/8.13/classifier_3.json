  "scenario": "The local pointer 'urh' is declared as a non-const pointer (struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = ws->urh;) even though run_usock does not modify the pointed object \u2014 it only passes it to MHD_upgrade_action at the end. If the function(s) that use 'urh' do not modify the object, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (e.g. const struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh) and therefore the current code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, MHD_upgrade_action or other uses require a non-const pointer, then making it const would be impossible and no violation would occur.)"
