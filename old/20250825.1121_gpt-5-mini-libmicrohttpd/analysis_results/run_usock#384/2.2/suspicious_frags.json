Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have selected fragments that are suspicious with respect to potential dead or redundant operations and places that may cause observable no-ops or missed effects (e.g. missing free for some frame types, redundant/unclear casts, computation/usage of buf_size and associated allocation/formatting, and the lock/unlock error-checks calling abort()). Other parts of the function (variable declarations, the loop structure, calls to make_blocking, ws_receive_frame, ws_send_frame, free(ws), MHD_upgrade_action and related clean-up) are normal control and resource-management operations that clearly affect program behaviour and are not obviously removable without changing semantics, so they do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 (dead code) in this context."
