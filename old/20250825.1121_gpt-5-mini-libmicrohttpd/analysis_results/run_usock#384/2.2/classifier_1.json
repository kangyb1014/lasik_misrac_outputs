Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of run_usock:\n```c\nstatic void *\nrun_usock (void *cls)\n{\n  struct WsData *ws = cls;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = ws->urh;\n  unsigned char buf[2048];\n  unsigned char *msg;\n  char *text;\n  ssize_t got;\n  int type;\n  int i;\n\n  make_blocking (ws->sock);\n  while (1)\n  {\n    got = recv (ws->sock, (void *) buf, sizeof (buf), 0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n    msg = ws_receive_frame (buf, &got, &type);\n    if (NULL == msg)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n    if (type == WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME)\n    {\n      ssize_t sent;\n      int buf_size;\n      buf_size = snprintf (NULL, 0, \"User#%d: %s\", (int) ws->sock, msg);\n      if (0 < buf_size)\n      {\n        text = malloc ((size_t) buf_size + 1);\n        if (NULL != text)\n        {\n          if (snprintf (text, (size_t) buf_size + 1,\n                        \"User#%d: %s\", (int) ws->sock, msg) == buf_size)\n            sent = ws_send_frame (ws->sock, text, (size_t) buf_size);\n          else\n            sent = -1;\n          free (text);\n        }\n        else\n          sent = -1;\n      }\n      else\n        sent = -1;\n      free (msg);\n      if (-1 == sent)\n      {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      if (type == WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME)\n      {\n        free (msg);\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)\n  {\n    if (CLIENT_SOCKS[i] == ws->sock)\n    {\n      CLIENT_SOCKS[i] = MHD_INVALID_SOCKET;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_unlock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  free (ws);\n  MHD_upgrade_action (urh, MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE);\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function run_usock:\n#define WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME 1\n...\n#define WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME 8\n...\nstatic pthread_mutex_t MUTEX = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER\n...\n#define MAX_CLIENTS 10\n...\nstatic MHD_socket CLIENT_SOCKS[MAX_CLIENTS]\n...\n#define MHD_INVALID_SOCKET (-1)\n...\nstruct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle\n...\nvoid\nMHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  /* Cache 'daemon' here to avoid data races */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *const daemon = connection->daemon;\n#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n#endif /* MHD_USE_THREADS */\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->urh);\n  mhd_assert (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME));\n\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n  connection->urh->was_closed = true;\n  connection->resuming = true;\n  daemon->resuming = true;\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex);\n  if ( (MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_ (daemon->itc)) &&\n       (!

  "scenario": "The mutex lock/unlock checks and the abort() calls are not dead. The calls to pthread_mutex_lock(&MUTEX) and pthread_mutex_unlock(&MUTEX) perform synchronization side\u2011effects and the subsequent if(0 != ...) abort(); handles error cases where the mutex operations fail. If those checks (and abort calls) were removed then in the failure case program behaviour would change (the program would continue instead of terminating), so the operations are not dead. Note: even if on the target platform pthread_mutex_* always returns 0 so abort() is never reached, that makes abort() unreachable in practice; per the rule notes unreachable code is not classified as dead code, and the checks remain valid defensive code."
