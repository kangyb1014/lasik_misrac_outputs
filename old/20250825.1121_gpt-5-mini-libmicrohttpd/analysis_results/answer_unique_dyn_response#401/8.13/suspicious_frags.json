  "explanation": "The fragments not listed were evaluated and not considered relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. The const-qualified pointer parameters already present in the signature (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) need no further investigation for missing const. The string-literal method macros (e.g. MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET) are used via const char * and are appropriate. The explicit (void) casts marking unused parameters are harmless and do not affect pointer qualification. Many of the function parameter types and callback signature components originate from the external MHD API; those prototype-mandated pointer types (e.g. struct MHD_Connection * and size_t * parameters) cannot be changed locally without breaking the required callback signature, so they are not flagged here. Other non-pointer symbols (e.g. body_dyn_size) are irrelevant to Rule 8.13."
