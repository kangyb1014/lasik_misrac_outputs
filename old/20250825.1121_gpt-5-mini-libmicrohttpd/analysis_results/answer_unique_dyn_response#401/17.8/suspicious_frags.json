  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to in this function. The MISRA rule prohibits modifying the pointer parameter itself; modifying the object pointed to is allowed. Examination of each pointer parameter shows only permitted uses:\n\n- cls: only cast to void ((void) cls;) \u2014 no assignment to cls.\n- connection: passed to other functions but not assigned to; the pointer itself is not modified.\n- url, method, version, upload_data: only cast to void or read (method is compared via strcmp) \u2014 not reassigned.\n- upload_data_size: cast to void ((void) upload_data_size;) \u2014 not modified.\n- req_cls (void **): the code reads and writes *req_cls (NULL == *req_cls and *req_cls = (void *)&marker). Writing the object pointed to is allowed by the rule; the pointer parameter req_cls itself is not reassigned.\n\nOther expressions (casts like (void *) body_dyn) concern non-parameter objects and do not modify any function parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
