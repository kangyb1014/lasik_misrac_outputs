  "explanation": "I reported all control expressions present in the function: the two runtime if-statements and the compile-time #if/#else/#endif branch. Other parts of the function are not controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3: variable declarations/initializers (e.g. static int marker = 0), (void) casts for unused parameters, function calls and assignments (MHD_create_response_from_buffer[_static], MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response), and return statements are not control expressions that could be invariant under Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements in the function beyond the listed fragments, so no additional control expressions need investigation for invariance."
