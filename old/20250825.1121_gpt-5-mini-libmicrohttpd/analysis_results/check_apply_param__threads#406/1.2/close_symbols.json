  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about language extensions we must inspect any symbols whose definitions might use compiler extensions (inline asm, GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin uses, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, zero-length arrays, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, etc.) and any types used in parameter/format operations. Explanations: \n\n- tool_params (definition and type of member 'threads'): The type or declaration of tool_params.threads may use typedefs or nonstandard constructs (bit-fields, anonymous structs/unions, compiler-specific attributes). We must see its definition to ensure no language extensions are used in the type or member declaration. \n\n- num_threads (declaration and type): The global/local variable num_threads type must be checked for typedefs or attributes (e.g., __attribute__((aligned)), unusual integer types). Also needed to confirm format-specifier compatibility (not an extension issue per se, but ensures correct analysis). \n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count (definition): The body or prototype of this function may contain extensions (inline asm, compiler builtins, attributes, nonstandard linkage). The call in the target function occurs twice, so its implementation must be inspected. \n\n- detect_process_cpu_core_count (definition): Called by get_process_cpu_core_count per the call graph; its implementation may hold the platform-specific detection logic and likely the place where extensions (syscalls, inline asm, platform macros) appear. \n\n- get_cpu_core_count (definition): Likewise, its implementation may use platform-specific or compiler-specific constructs; it is directly called in the target and may contain extensions. \n\n- detect_cpu_core_count (definition): Implementation detail of get_cpu_core_count; must be inspected for extensions. \n\n- print_all_cores_used (definition): The function invoked for a message may itself use extensions (e.g., nonstandard IO, attributes). Its definition should be checked. \n\n- stdio declarations / include (printf, fprintf, stderr): Although standard, the actual included headers or locally redefined macros could hide nonstandard macros or wrappers. Inspect the <stdio.h> inclusion or the declarations used in this translation unit to ensure printf/fprintf/stderr are standard and not implemented using compiler extensions or replaced by macros that use extensions.\n\nProviding these symbol definitions allows the next agent to inspect the actual implementations and type declarations for any compiler-specific language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
