  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code contains only standard ISO C constructs: a static function definition, void parameter list, if statements, return, assignments, and calls to standard library I/O functions (fprintf, printf) and to other functions (get_process_cpu_core_count, get_cpu_core_count, print_all_cores_used). There are no uses of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_* functions, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler (asm), Microsoft-specific keywords, or other vendor-specific language extensions. Adjacent string literal concatenation is standard C, and repeated function calls are normal code behavior. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions)."
