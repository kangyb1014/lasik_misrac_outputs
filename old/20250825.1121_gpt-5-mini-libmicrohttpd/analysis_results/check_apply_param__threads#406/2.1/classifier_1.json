  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if-block is reachable when num_threads equals the detected CPU core count (for example, tool_params.threads == 4 and get_cpu_core_count() == 4), so the printf and print_all_cores_used() can execute. The code would only be unreachable if, by program invariants not shown here, get_cpu_core_count() could never equal num_threads for any execution (e.g. get_cpu_core_count() is guaranteed always different), but no such invariant is evident in the fragment."
