  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in general: the conditional return prevents execution only when tool_params.threads equals zero at runtime, so the subsequent code is reachable for other values. This does not inherently create unreachable code. A violation would occur if tool_params.threads is a compile-time constant known to be zero (for example, a #define or a const integer optimized as constant), making the code after the return provably unreachable; in that specific case Rule 2.1 would be violated."
