  "explanation": "For MISRA unreachable-code analysis we must know which branches/returns can actually occur at runtime. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- tool_params (definition and all initialization sites that assign tool_params.threads): The initial if (0 == tool_params.threads) return; makes the entire body conditional on tool_params.threads. To determine whether the return can ever be taken (and thus whether the rest of the function is unreachable) you must inspect the type, possible value range and all code paths that initialize or modify tool_params.threads (e.g. command-line parsing, default initializers).\n\n- num_threads (definition): num_threads is assigned from tool_params.threads and then used in comparisons. Its type and any constraints (signed/unsigned width, static initialization, volatile, atomic) can affect comparisons and reachability decisions.\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count(): The first conditional compares get_process_cpu_core_count() < num_threads and also prints its return value. To know whether that branch can ever be true (or is always false making the fprintf unreachable) you must see the implementation and possible return values/side effects of this function.\n\n- get_cpu_core_count(): The equality test get_cpu_core_count() == num_threads controls the second branch that calls print_all_cores_used(). You need the implementation and return-value contract to determine if that equality can occur (or is impossible, making that branch unreachable).\n\n- detect_process_cpu_core_count(): get_process_cpu_core_count() calls this; if the behavior or return-range depends on detect_process_cpu_core_count() internals, those must be inspected to fully determine reachability of the first branch.\n\n- detect_cpu_core_count(): get_cpu_core_count() calls this; similarly required if get_cpu_core_count() is just a wrapper and the actual return-range logic lives here.\n\n- print_all_cores_used(): If the second branch is reachable, this call is executed; to decide whether any code inside print_all_cores_used() is unreachable (or whether the call is effectively a no-op making its presence irrelevant) you need its definition.\n\n(Also note: standard IO functions like printf/fprintf and stderr are not needed to decide reachability of these branches \u2014 only the values and control-flow produced by the listed symbols are required.)"
