  "explanation": "No function in the provided code fragments takes parameters, so there are no function parameters to be modified (Rule 17.8). Specifically:\n- check_apply_param__threads(void): has no parameters; it only reads global tool_params.threads and assigns to the global num_threads. Reading/modifying globals or local statics is not covered by Rule 17.8 (which concerns function parameters).\n- get_process_cpu_core_count(void), get_cpu_core_count(void), print_all_cores_used(void): all are parameterless and therefore cannot violate the rule. Their modifications are to local static variables or perform I/O, not to function parameters or pointer parameters.\n- The uses of fprintf/printf pass values and string literals; they do not modify any caller-supplied function parameter.\n\nNo other parameter-bearing functions are present in the provided snippets; therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 based on the supplied code."
