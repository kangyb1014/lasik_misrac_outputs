This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Provide the definitions/types of these symbols because they are referenced (directly or indirectly) by check_apply_param__threads and could contain or trigger uses of <string.h> functions or influence how string functions would be invoked:\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count: Called directly by the target. Its implementation might call string.h routines or manipulate buffers used by the target's logic.\n- get_cpu_core_count: Called directly by the target. Its implementation might call string.h routines or return values that cause different code paths in callees that use string functions.\n- print_all_cores_used: Called directly by the target. This function is likely to format or build strings; its body must be inspected for any use of string.h functions (strcpy, strcat, strlen, etc.).\n- detect_process_cpu_core_count: Callee of get_process_cpu_core_count. If the getter forwards work here, any string handling would appear in this implementation.\n- detect_cpu_core_count: Callee of get_cpu_core_count. Same reason as above \u2014 the low-level detection routine may use string handling.\n- tool_params (type and .threads member): The target reads tool_params.threads; knowing its type (signed/unsigned width) is necessary to be sure any conversions/formatting do not cause buffer misuse when interacting with other routines.\n- num_threads: The global/local variable assigned from tool_params.threads and later printed; its type is needed to check any formatting/printing interactions and to follow data flow into callees.\n\nCollecting these symbols (implementations and type declarations) lets the next analyst determine whether any string.h functions are used in the call chain reachable from check_apply_param__threads and whether any such uses could access out-of-bounds memory."
