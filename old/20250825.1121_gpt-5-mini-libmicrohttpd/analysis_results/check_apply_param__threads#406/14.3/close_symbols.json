  "explanation": "tool_params: Need the struct declaration and semantics of its 'threads' member to determine whether tool_params.threads can vary at run-time or is effectively invariant (e.g. const or never written after compile). This decides if the first if (0 == tool_params.threads) is an invariant controlling expression.\ncode that sets/initializes tool_params.threads (option parsing / initialization): The places that assign tool_params.threads (command-line parsing, defaults) are required to know whether threads can change before or during check_apply_param__threads, and whether its value is fixed for the program execution.\nnum_threads: Need the declaration and storage-class/qualifiers of the global (or file-scope) num_threads to know if it can be modified asynchronously or elsewhere (affecting invariance) and to check whether its value is constant within the function.\nget_process_cpu_core_count: The full definition/implementation is required to know whether its return value can vary at run-time (reads dynamic system state, depends on affinity changes, uses cached value, is deterministic), and whether repeated calls in the function are invariant.\ndetect_process_cpu_core_count: This helper implementation may reveal whether the process-specific core count is computed once, cached, or can change; needed to judge invariance of get_process_cpu_core_count.\nget_cpu_core_count: The definition is required to determine whether the system CPU core count can change at run-time or is cached/constant; this affects whether the equality test with num_threads can be an invariant.\ndetect_cpu_core_count: The detector implementation may show caching, static initialization, or dynamic queries \u2014 relevant to decide if get_cpu_core_count() is invariant.\nany globals accessed by the CPU-count functions (caches/flags): If the CPU-count functions read/write global cache variables or flags, those globals determine whether their return values are invariant; include their declarations and update sites to assess variability.\n\nRationale: MISRA\u2019s \"controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" requires knowledge of whether the operands in each if() can take different values at run-time. The listed symbols are the program objects and functions that determine those operand values, so their definitions/usages are necessary to decide if the controlling expressions in check_apply_param__threads are truly invariant."
