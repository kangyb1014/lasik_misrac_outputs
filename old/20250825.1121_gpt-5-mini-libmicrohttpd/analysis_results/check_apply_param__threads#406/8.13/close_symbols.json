  "explanation": "For the MISRA rule about pointing to const-qualified types, we must examine every symbol in the function that involves pointer types or might hide pointer members. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- tool_params (definition/type): check the type of tool_params and its member threads. If tool_params contains pointer members, their const-qualification must be examined. Also confirm threads is an integer (not a pointer) so no missing const applies.\n\n- num_threads (declaration/type): verify its type (likely unsigned int). If num_threads were a pointer, MISRA const requirements would apply; confirming it is a non-pointer avoids false positives.\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count (prototype/return type): its prototype/return type must be known (e.g., unsigned int). It does not appear to return a pointer, but confirm it does not return pointer-to-non-const that should be const.\n\n- get_cpu_core_count (prototype/return type): same rationale as above; ensure it does not return pointer types requiring const.\n\n- print_all_cores_used (prototype): confirm its signature takes no pointer parameters (or that any pointer parameters are const-qualified where required). It is called without args here but its declaration is still needed for full analysis.\n\n- fprintf (prototype, from <stdio.h>): fprintf takes a FILE * and a const char * format. We need the standard prototype to confirm the format argument is const-qualified and the FILE * parameter is non-const (because I/O functions modify stream state) so MISRA expectations are met/justified.\n\n- printf (prototype, from <stdio.h>): same as fprintf for format string const qualification.\n\n- stderr (extern FILE* from <stdio.h>): confirm the type is FILE * (non-const). MISRA might flag use of non-const pointers that could be const-qualified; knowledge that stderr is a mutable stream (FILE *) justifies it not being const.\n\n- FILE (type definition): to understand whether FILE* points to mutable state (and thus should not be const) we need the FILE type declaration (or at least the semantic that FILE represents a mutable I/O object).\n\nCollecting these definitions/prototypes lets the analyzer determine whether any pointer used or returned in this function could/should be const-qualified according to the MISRA rule, and whether any apparent non-const usage is required by the standard library or by the actual types involved."
