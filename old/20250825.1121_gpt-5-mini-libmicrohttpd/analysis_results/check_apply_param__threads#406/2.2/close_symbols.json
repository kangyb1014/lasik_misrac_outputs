Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "tool_params: required to know possible values and initialization of tool_params.threads (if it is always 0 or can be non\u2011zero). If threads is effectively constant 0 the whole function becomes dead; otherwise branches may execute.\n\nnum_threads: required to determine whether the local/global variable assignment (num_threads = tool_params.threads) is used later; if the assignment has no observable effect elsewhere it could be dead.\n\nget_process_cpu_core_count: central to both the < comparison and the warning message decision. We must know its return semantics, determinism and whether it has side effects (observable state changes) so that calls cannot be removed without changing behavior.\n\ndetect_process_cpu_core_count: get_process_cpu_core_count calls this symbol (per call graph). Its implementation may perform detection with side effects or update cached state; that affects whether repeated calls or removal would change program behavior.\n\nget_cpu_core_count: used in the equality test and controls the printf + print_all_cores_used path. We must know its semantics/determinism and side effects to decide if that branch (and its calls) can be removed.\n\ndetect_cpu_core_count: get_cpu_core_count delegates to this; its behavior (caching, side effects, I/O) can affect return values and whether calls are observable.\n\nprint_all_cores_used: called when the equality holds. Its side effects (printing, state inspection, logging, modifying state) determine whether that call is dead; must be inspected.\n\nfprintf, printf, stderr: standard I/O calls and the stderr stream are observable side effects. Include them so the analysis knows the function performs output (which is not dead) and to confirm whether they can be treated as no\u2011ops in this build/configuration."
