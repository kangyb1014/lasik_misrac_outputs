  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_apply_param__threads:\n```c\nstatic void\ncheck_apply_param__threads (void)\n{\n  if (0 == tool_params.threads)\n    return;\n\n  num_threads = tool_params.threads;\n\n  if (get_process_cpu_core_count () < num_threads)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The requested number of threads (%u) is \"\n             \"higher than the number of detected available CPU cores (%u).\\n\",\n             num_threads, get_process_cpu_core_count ());\n    fprintf (stderr, \"This decreases the performance. \"\n             \"Consider using fewer threads.\\n\");\n  }\n  if (get_cpu_core_count () == num_threads)\n  {\n    printf (\"The requested number of threads is equal to the number of \"\n            \"detected CPU cores.\\n\");\n    print_all_cores_used ();\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function check_apply_param__threads:\nstatic struct PerfRepl_parameters tool_params = {\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0,\n  0\n}\n...\nstatic unsigned int num_threads = 0\n...\nstatic unsigned int\nget_process_cpu_core_count (void)\n{\n  static unsigned int proc_num_cpu_cores = 0;\n  if (0 == proc_num_cpu_cores)\n    proc_num_cpu_cores = detect_process_cpu_core_count ();\n  return proc_num_cpu_cores;\n}\n...\nstatic unsigned int\ndetect_process_cpu_core_count (void)\n{\n  unsigned int num_proc_cpu_cores;\n  unsigned int sys_cpu_cores;\n  int res;\n\n  sys_cpu_cores = get_cpu_core_count ();\n  res = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count ();\n  if (0 > res)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Cannot detect the number of logical CPU cores available \"\n             \"for this process.\\n\");\n    if (1 != sys_cpu_cores)\n      printf (\"Assuming all %u system logical CPU cores are available to run \"\n              \"threads of this process.\\n\", sys_cpu_cores);\n    else\n      printf (\"Assuming single logical CPU core available for this process.\\n\");\n    num_proc_cpu_cores = sys_cpu_cores;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    printf (\"Detected %d logical CPU core%s available to run threads \"\n            \"of this process.\\n\", res, (1 == res) ?

  "scenario": "No violation. The calls to get_process_cpu_core_count() produce values used in the conditional and in the fprintf format argument, so they are not operations whose removal would leave program behaviour unchanged. The first call may have side effects (initial detection/printing) and the second supplies the numeric value for the warning message; neither is dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
