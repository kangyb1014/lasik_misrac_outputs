The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "tool_params \u2014 needed to know the type and semantics of tool_params.threads (is it an integer type, signed/unsigned, volatile, or has side effects on access). The MISRA rule depends on knowing whether values used as loop counters/conditions are objects modified elsewhere.\n\nnum_threads \u2014 the target function assigns to this global; we must know its type and whether it is used or modified inside any callee (a for-loop body called from here must not modify the loop counter). If callees access/modify num_threads, that can create a MISRA violation.\n\nget_process_cpu_core_count \u2014 called directly from the target function; any for-loops inside this function (or their loop counters/side effects) are part of the behaviour invoked by the target function and must be checked for the three clauses and for modification of objects used in the loop body.\n\ndetect_process_cpu_core_count \u2014 callee of get_process_cpu_core_count (per the call graph). Because the behaviour of called functions is part of the for-loop body semantics, nested callees must be inspected for for-loops and for modifications of loop counters or objects used in the controlling expressions.\n\nget_cpu_core_count \u2014 directly called by the target and also reachable through detect_process_cpu_core_count; its implementation must be checked for any for-loops and for use/modification of objects that interact with loops in callers.\n\ndetect_cpu_core_count \u2014 callee of get_cpu_core_count; include to inspect nested loops or side effects that could affect loop well-formedness in the call chain.\n\nprint_all_cores_used \u2014 called when cpu count equals requested threads; any for-loops inside this function are executed from the target function and thus must be checked against the MISRA for-loop requirements.\n\n(Notes: standard I/O functions like fprintf/printf and the symbol stderr are not required for MISRA for-loop conformance checking unless their implementations contain relevant for-loops or they modify objects used as loop counters; typical library declarations are not needed. The listed symbols cover all callees reachable from the target function per the static call graph and the global objects the target manipulates.)"
