  "explanation": "I identified all controlling expressions in this function: the three if statements and the conditional (ternary) expression in the return. These are the only places where control flow depends on a controlling expression; therefore they are the only candidates for Rule 14.3 (invariant controlling expressions). Other fragments (function signature, assignments such as tool_params.medium = ! 0;, fprintf calls, returns of constant enum values, braces, and other statements) are not controlling expressions and thus do not need investigation under Rule 14.3. There are no loops or other conditional constructs in this function beyond the four reported expressions."
