  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C: a static function returning an enum, use of const char*, calls to fprintf (standard library), member accesses (tool_params.*), character-literal comparison ( '-' == param_name[1] ), the conditional operator (?:), array indexing, and the logical-not expression (!0) which yields a standard integer value. There are no compiler-specific tokens or extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, #pragma with implementation-defined handlers, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific language extensions documented as compiler extensions. Note: the identifier process_param__medium contains a double underscore, which may be reserved by the implementation per the C standard, but that is a naming-reservation issue rather than use of a compiler language extension and therefore is not flagged here under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (which concerns explicit compiler language extensions)."
