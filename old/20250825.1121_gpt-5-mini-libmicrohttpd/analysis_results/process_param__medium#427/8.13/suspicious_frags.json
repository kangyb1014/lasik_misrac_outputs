  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in the function is the parameter 'const char *param_name', which is already const-qualified as required by the rule. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-type members of tool_params in the shown code that could be made const. The string literals used in fprintf are not pointer variables declared in the function. The use of param_name[1] and passing param_name to fprintf do not indicate a pointer that should be more const-qualified under Rule 8.13. Therefore no code fragments here need to be investigated for missing const qualification of pointers."
