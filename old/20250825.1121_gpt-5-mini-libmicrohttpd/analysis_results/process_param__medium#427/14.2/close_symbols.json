The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n- tool_params (object) and its definition (type/structure) including members: empty, tiny, large, medium\n  - You must know the exact declaration and types of these members (e.g. int, bool, volatile, bitfield) to determine whether accesses to them have side effects or whether modifying them would violate the \u2018\u2018single loop counter\u2019\u2019 / \u2018\u2018no other object modified in the loop body\u2019\u2019 constraints if a for loop were introduced or if code is transformed. If any member is volatile, or a macro, or its access triggers side effects, that changes the MISRA for-loop analysis.\n\n- param_name (function parameter) \u2014 its declared type (const char *)\n  - The code indexes param_name[1] and compares it to '-'. Knowing the declared type confirms that indexing is valid and has no hidden side effects (e.g. if param_name were a macro or a special type). This matters when reasoning about expressions used in loop clauses (they must have no persistent side effects).\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result and the symbolic values: PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR\n  - To determine whether return expressions are simple value returns or macros/functions with side effects, you need the definitions. If any of these are macros that expand to expressions with side effects, that could affect clause semantics under MISRA.\n\n- fprintf (declaration/prototype) and any macro wrapper that might replace it\n  - The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of a for-loop body as including any functions called within it. If this function (or a future variant) contained a for loop that called fprintf, you need to know whether fprintf is a normal library function or redefined/macroed to something with additional side effects that could modify loop-control objects.\n\n- stderr (symbol) and its type (FILE *)\n  - As with fprintf, confirm stderr is the standard FILE* object and not a macro or object with special behaviour; this ensures calls using it do not implicitly modify objects that would be relevant to a for-loop well-formedness check.\n\nNote: process_param__medium itself contains no for loop. The above symbols are the minimal relevant declarations/definitions required to judge whether any expressions in this function (or calls it performs) could introduce side effects or hidden modifications relevant to MISRA\u2019s for-loop requirements. If you also want to analyze callers or callees for for-loops that invoke this function, include their definitions/callees as well."
