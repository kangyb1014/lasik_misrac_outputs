  "explanation": "No code fragments modify the function parameter param_name. The parameter is only read: used in fprintf calls and indexed as param_name[1] for comparison; these are permitted (reading the object pointed to is allowed, and the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified \u2014 though here only reads occur). There are no assignments to param_name, no increments/decrements (e.g. param_name++, param_name += ...), and it is not passed by address to allow modification of the pointer itself. The assignment tool_params.medium = ! 0 modifies a global structure member, not the function parameter, so it is not relevant to Rule 17.8. Therefore no fragments in this function require investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
