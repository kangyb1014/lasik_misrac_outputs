The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Brief justification for each symbol (only those necessary to determine MISRA C \"well-formed for\" violations for the target function):\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2\n  - The target function is a trivial wrapper that simply calls this function. Any for-loop behaviour that could violate the rule will occur in this callee (or its callees). You must have the function body/prototype to inspect its for statements and any loops inside functions it calls.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3\n  - It is a transitive callee (appears in the static call graph of MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2). The MISRA rule counts the behaviour of functions called within a for-loop body; loops inside this function (or its use of loop counters/control flags) can affect compliance. Include its definition/prototype and body.\n\n- __builtin_unreachable\n  - Appears in the call graph of MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2. Although a compiler builtin, its presence can affect control-flow reasoning (dead paths, loop exits). Include knowledge of its use sites so you can reason whether it appears inside loop bodies or alters loop behaviour.\n\n- MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE\n  - A macro/constant passed as an argument from the target into the callee(s). If any for loops in the callee use this value as a loop bound or loop-counter initializer/step, its value is required to decide whether the loop clauses meet MISRA requirements (e.g., single loop counter, bounds derived from objects modified in the loop body).\n\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5\n  - A macro/enum constant passed into the callee(s). Its value or usage might change control flow or select code paths that contain for loops; include it to determine which code paths (and associated loops) are exercised.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - The type of the connection parameter \u2014 callee implementations may inspect or modify fields of this structure inside loop bodies, or use its fields as loop counters or flags. You need the struct definition to see whether any fields used as loop counters/flags are modified in loop bodies, which affects MISRA compliance.\n\n- uint8_t\n  - The digest parameter type; knowing the exact type (from stdint.h) matters if callee code uses array indexing, loop counters derived from sizeof/digest size, or performs arithmetic that affects loop counters/conditions. Include the typedef so numeric widths and array sizes are clear.\n\nNotes and scope guidance:\n- The target function itself contains no for loop; therefore the primary analysis must inspect MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 and its callees. Provide the full source/bodies (or at least the control-flow/loop parts) of those functions and the listed macros/types so the next agent can check each for-loop against the MISRA clauses (initialization expression, condition side-effects and use of only loop counter/flags, increment expression, single unmodified loop counter, and that functions called from the loop body do not modify loop counters or other objects disallowed by the rule)."
