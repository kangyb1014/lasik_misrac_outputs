  "explanation": "- MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2: The target function simply forwards all arguments to this function. You must inspect its body to find any use of memcmp (or other string-comparison patterns) that could violate the MISRA rule.\n- MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3: MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 calls this function (per the static call graph). Any memcmp use that actually performs comparisons may be in this downstream function, so it must be analyzed as well.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of the standard memcmp function to compare null-terminated strings. You need to locate calls to memcmp and examine their arguments and size parameters to decide if memcmp is being (mis)used on C strings.\n- strlen: Code often uses strlen to compute the size argument passed to memcmp when comparing strings. If strlen (or similar) is used to form the length argument, that is evidence of memcmp being applied to null-terminated strings and is relevant to the rule.\n- struct MHD_Connection: The connection object may supply buffers or pointers (username, realm, internal buffers) whose provenance affects whether compared data are null-terminated strings. Inspecting its definition can show whether arguments passed into memcmp are strings.\n- MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE: The target passes this size into the downstream call. Knowing its value and use sites helps determine whether memcmp is being used on fixed binary digest buffers (which is appropriate) versus string lengths.\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: The algorithm constant is forwarded to downstream functions and may change code paths (e.g., choosing string vs binary comparison). You need it to understand which comparison logic is exercised.\n\nAnalyzing these symbols lets the next agent find all memcmp usages reachable from the target, determine what is being compared (binary digest bytes vs null-terminated strings), and conclude whether the MISRA rule is violated."
