  "explanation": "- MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 (definition): The target function only forwards its arguments to this callee. Any controlling expressions (if/for/while/switch/do-while) that could be invariant will live in the body of this function, so its source is required to determine MISRA C compliance.\\n- MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3 (definition): The static call graph shows the second-level callee is invoked from MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2. An invariant controlling expression could exist there, so its body must be examined as part of the call chain.\\n- MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE (macro/constant): The target passes this constant as a length parameter. If any loop or conditional in the callees uses that length, knowing whether it is a compile\u2011time invariant or an integer constant expression is necessary to decide if the controlling expression is invariant and whether any declared exceptions apply.\\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5 (macro/enum value): This algorithm constant is forwarded to the callee(s) and may select branches or loops. Its definition (constant vs. computed) and possible values are needed to determine if resulting controlling expressions are invariant.\\n- struct MHD_Connection (type/definition): Callees may read fields from the connection to form controlling expressions. The structure layout and relevant field semantics are required to know whether a controlling expression depends on runtime data or is effectively invariant.\\n- __builtin_unreachable (builtin usage site): It appears in the callee according to the static call graph; its use can indicate intentionally unreachable code paths or assumptions that affect control flow analysis. The site and surrounding code must be inspected to judge whether any controlling expressions are invariant or masked by unreachable code."
