  "explanation": "Other pointer parameters do not need investigation: realm and username are already const-qualified (const char *), and digest is declared const (const uint8_t digest[MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE]) so they conform to Rule 8.13. Non-pointer parameters (unsigned int nonce_timeout, the integer return type) are not relevant to pointer const-qualification. The macro MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE and the algorithm constant MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5 are not pointer types and therefore not subject to Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameter in this function that is not const-qualified is the connection parameter; the call passing that parameter is included so callers/callees can be inspected to determine whether connection could safely be const-qualified."
