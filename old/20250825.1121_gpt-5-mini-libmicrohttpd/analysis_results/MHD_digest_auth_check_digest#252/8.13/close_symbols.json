  "explanation": "- MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 (declaration/prototype): The target simply forwards its pointer arguments to this function. To decide whether the target's pointer parameters should be const-qualified (or whether it illegally discards const), you must know the exact parameter types of MHD_digest_auth_check_digest2 (e.g., whether it takes struct MHD_Connection * vs const struct MHD_Connection *, const char * vs char *, const uint8_t * vs uint8_t *). If the callee requires non-const, the target cannot safely tighten its parameter to const; if the callee already uses const, the target could and should declare const where appropriate. - MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3 (declaration/prototype): The static call graph shows digest2 forwards to digest3. Even if digest2\u2019s prototype is non-const, the deeper callee(s) may determine whether the data are actually modified. You need the prototype(s) of downstream callees (digest3) to determine whether const qualification is possible throughout the call chain. - struct MHD_Connection (type/definition): To reason whether the connection pointer could/should be a pointer-to-const, you must know what MHD_Connection contains (whether it models mutable state that must be modified). The struct definition shows whether treating the pointed-to object as immutable is appropriate. - MHD_MD5_DIGEST_SIZE (macro/definition): The digest parameter is declared as an array sized by this macro; include its definition to confirm the exact declared type and dimensionality. While size does not affect const qualification directly, the exact declaration helps confirm the digest parameter type that is being forwarded. - MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5 (macro/enum/definition): Included because it is one of the forwarded arguments and may indicate the algorithm/type semantics used by downstream functions; not directly about constness, but useful to inspect callee prototypes/overloads that may change pointer constness based on algorithm selection."
