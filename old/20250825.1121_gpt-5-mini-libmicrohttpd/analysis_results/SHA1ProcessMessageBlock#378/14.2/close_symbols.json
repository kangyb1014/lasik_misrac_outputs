The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) SHA1CircularShift: This function (or macro) is called inside the loop bodies. MISRA's requirement treats the behaviour of the loop body as including called functions, so we must inspect SHA1CircularShift's implementation/signature to ensure it has no persistent side effects, does not modify the loop counter 'i' (directly or indirectly), and does not modify any object that is used in the for-loop second/third clauses. If SHA1CircularShift is a macro, its macro expansion is required (macro body can contain side-effects).  \n\n2) struct SHA1Context: The loop bodies access members of the context (message_block, intermediate_hash, message_block_index). We need the struct definition to confirm the types/qualifiers (e.g. volatile) and to ensure there is no aliasing or unusual semantics that could cause the loop counter or loop-clause objects to be modified implicitly by writes to these members or by functions that take a pointer to the context. Knowing the layout also helps verify that no object used in the for-loop clauses is modified by the loop body.  \n\nNo other external functions are called in the loop bodies and the loop control expressions use only the local loop counter 'i', so no additional symbols are required for determining compliance with the cited MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule."
