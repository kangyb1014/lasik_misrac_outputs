This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- struct SHA1Context: Essential to check array types and sizes. The target indexes context->message_block at i*4 + 0..3 for i in 0..15 and writes/reads context->intermediate_hash[0..4]; to prove no out-of-bounds access you must know whether message_block is an array (and its length) or a pointer, and the exact sizes of message_block and intermediate_hash members.\n- SHA1CircularShift: The target calls this function repeatedly. Its signature and definition are needed to ensure it has no side effects that could cause out-of-bounds memory accesses (and to confirm it does not call any <string.h> functions). Also check its parameter expectations (valid shift counts).\n- SHA1PadMessage and SHA1Input: They are direct callers of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (from the call graph). To fully assess whether any string.h usage in the overall SHA1 processing chain could lead to accesses beyond object bounds (e.g., they may populate context->message_block using memcpy/memset/str*), inspect these functions for string.h calls and for how they allocate/fill the buffers passed into SHA1ProcessMessageBlock.\n- SHA1Result and ws_get_accept_value: These are callers of the callers (per the graph). Include them only to trace upward if SHA1PadMessage or SHA1Input are thin wrappers or rely on externally supplied buffers; they may help identify usages of string.h that affect the buffers processed by SHA1ProcessMessageBlock.\n- Macros/constants defining sizes (e.g. block/message/hash sizes): If the struct uses symbolic constants for buffer sizes, you need their values to validate that the indexing in SHA1ProcessMessageBlock is within bounds.\n- stdint typedefs (uint32_t): Provide the exact type definitions to confirm width and behavior of shifts/bitwise ops (not directly a string.h concern but required for complete static analysis).\n\nThese symbols let the next analyst determine (1) whether SHA1ProcessMessageBlock itself uses any <string.h> functions (it does not) and (2) whether any string.h calls elsewhere in the SHA1 call chain manipulate the buffers that SHA1ProcessMessageBlock indexes, potentially creating out-of-bounds conditions."
