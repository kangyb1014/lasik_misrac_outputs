Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for a dead-code (MISRA) analysis of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock:\n\n- SHA1CircularShift: This function is called repeatedly in the target. To decide whether the calls (and the computed temp/W values that depend on it) are necessary or have side effects, you must inspect SHA1CircularShift's implementation (is it pure or does it modify global state?). If it has no side effects and its results are never used, those calls could be dead; if it has side effects, they are not dead.\n\n- struct SHA1Context: The shape and semantics of this struct (fields message_block, intermediate_hash[], message_block_index types and aliases) are required to determine whether writes performed by SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (populating W[], updating intermediate_hash[], setting message_block_index = 0) affect program behaviour elsewhere. You must know sizes, signed/unsignedness, and whether fields alias other memory or are volatile.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage: A direct caller of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (per the static call graph). To decide if SHA1ProcessMessageBlock is reachable/used (and thus not dead code globally), examine SHA1PadMessage's control flow: under what conditions does it call SHA1ProcessMessageBlock, and are those conditions reachable from higher-level code?\n\n- SHA1Input: Another direct caller. Same rationale as for SHA1PadMessage \u2014 its control flow and calling conditions determine whether SHA1ProcessMessageBlock is actually invoked at runtime.\n\n- SHA1Result: Caller of SHA1PadMessage (per the call graph). Inspecting SHA1Result shows whether the higher-level SHA-1 API actually ends up invoking SHA1PadMessage -> SHA1ProcessMessageBlock in normal use (e.g., producing a digest), which is necessary to determine if removal of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock would affect behaviour.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value: Caller of SHA1Input (per the call graph). Tracing this path shows a concrete usage scenario (websocket accept value computation) and helps determine real-world reachability of the SHA1 processing code.\n\n- main (or other program entry points that may call ws_get_accept_value): To prove that the entire call chain is reachable from program start (and thus that SHA1ProcessMessageBlock is not dead), you need at least one program entry point that eventually leads to ws_get_accept_value (or demonstrate that ws_get_accept_value itself is invoked in normal operation). If no entry point reaches these callers, the function may effectively be dead code.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any operations inside SHA1ProcessMessageBlock are dead you must know (a) whether the called helper SHA1CircularShift has side effects, (b) the exact structure and usage of SHA1Context fields that are written, and (c) whether callers (and their callers up to program entry) actually invoke this function in reachable execution paths. Include the listed symbols and their definitions/implementations when performing the MISRA dead-code analysis."
