UINT64_MAX % 16 == 15, and within the loop digit comes from toxdigitvalue(*) and is constrained by the loop condition (digit >= 0) to the valid hex-digit range 0..15, so the comparison is always true when evaluated. Removing that comparison would not change program behaviour, so this executed operation constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The reporter\u2019s conclusion depends on an unstated/unspecified property of toxdigitvalue(). The code only guarantees (via the loop condition) that digit >= 0; it does not, in the shown fragment, prove digit <= 15. While it is true that UINT64_MAX % 16 == 15 and that a typical toxdigitvalue() implementation used for hex digits returns values in 0..15 (making the comparison always true in that particular project), that semantic guarantee is not present in the posted code. Under a strict MISRA review you may only mark an expression as dead if the project as a whole proves it can never affect behaviour. Given only this function, the sub\u2011expression ((uint64_t) digit <= (UINT64_MAX % 16)) is not provably redundant (because digit could legally be \u2265 16 if toxdigitvalue had a different contract), so the report as stated is not correct. If, however, the project-wide specification of toxdigitvalue() explicitly constrains returned values to 0..15, then the comparison would be redundant and could be reported as dead code."
