  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct given the code shown. The calls to strchr(args, '=') and strchr(args, '&') (and the later uses of string-handling helpers that expect NUL-terminated strings) assume that the object pointed to by args is a properly NUL-terminated string. The function only checks args != NULL and args[0] != '\\0' (i.e. non-empty), which does not guarantee that a terminating '\\0' exists later in the object. If a caller passes a buffer that is not NUL-terminated or args points near the end of an object without a terminator, strchr will scan past the object bounds and thus can cause an out-of-bounds access, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n\nThis conclusion depends on whether there is an external, guaranteed precondition (a documented and enforced contract) that args is always a NUL-terminated string. If such a guarantee exists and is part of the API contract, the code is acceptable. Absent that guarantee in the surrounding code or API documentation, the use of strchr here is unsafe with respect to Rule 21.17. A correct remediation would be to ensure callers always provide a NUL-terminated string (document and enforce the contract), or change the code to use bounded operations (e.g., memchr with a known length) or to accept and propagate an explicit length so searches cannot read past the object bounds."
