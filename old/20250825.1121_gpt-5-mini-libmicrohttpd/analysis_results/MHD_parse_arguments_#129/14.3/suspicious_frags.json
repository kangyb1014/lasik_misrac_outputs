  "explanation": "I have listed all controlling expressions (loop headers and conditional tests) in the provided code that should be inspected for potential invariant behaviour per MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Other code fragments need not be investigated for this rule because they are not controlling expressions (they are assignments, function-call statements, string/character operations, or comments) or because the controlling expressions that use variables (args, p, equals, amper) are modified within the loop or depend on runtime results (strchr, callback return values), so they are not statically invariant. The listed fragments are the relevant control points where an invariant controlling expression could occur and thus warrant inspection."
