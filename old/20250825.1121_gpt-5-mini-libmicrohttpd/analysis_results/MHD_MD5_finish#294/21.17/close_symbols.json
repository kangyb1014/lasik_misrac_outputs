  "explanation": "For a MISRA C analysis of potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds use of string.h functions in MHD_MD5_finish you must know the sizes, types and conditional compilation that determine the pointer ranges and the lengths passed to memset/memcpy and to the internal put/write helpers:\n\n- struct Md5Ctx: defines ctx->buffer, ctx->count and ctx->H and sizeof(struct Md5Ctx). Needed to check that writes to ctx->buffer (via memset, _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE and md5_transform) and the final memset(ctx,0,...) are within the object bounds.\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE: the block size in bytes used in the memset lengths and in the buffer boundary logic (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have, etc.). Essential to compute how many bytes are written/cleared.\n- MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD: number of bytes reserved for the length field (used to decide padding and the second memset size). Affects the second memset length and block space check.\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS: used to compute the pointer passed to _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE (ctx->buffer + MD5_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS - 2). Needed to ensure the 8\u2011byte length write lands inside ctx->buffer.\n- MD5_DIGEST_SIZE: number of digest bytes (used as memcpy length and prototype in the function signature). Required to verify memcpy(digest, alig_dgst, MD5_DIGEST_SIZE) and to ensure caller buffer size matches.\n- MD5_DIGEST_SIZE_WORDS: size (in words) of the temporary aligned digest array alig_dgst[]. Needed to confirm alig_dgst storage is large enough for the writes via _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE.\n- MD5_BYTES_IN_WORD: used in pointer arithmetic when writing digest via _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE; needed to check offsets into the digest buffer are inside bounds.\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE: implementation/behavior of this macro/function (how many bytes it writes and whether it uses aligned accesses). Needed to ensure its write of num_bits into ctx->buffer does not overflow the buffer.\n- _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE: implementation/behavior (how it writes 32\u2011bit words into destination). Required to verify the aligned temporary and direct writes into digest do not exceed destination sizes or violate alignment assumptions.\n- _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE_UNALIGNED: conditional compilation symbol that changes which code path is compiled. Necessary to know which code paths (memcpy vs direct _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE into digest) are active.\n- _MHD_UINT32_ALIGN: alignment constant used to decide whether to use the aligned temporary buffer + memcpy path. Needed to determine whether memcpy is actually executed and whether the alignment test is correct.\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: conditional compilation flag that alters branching and may force the memcpy path. Required to know which branches are compiled and therefore which string.h calls occur.\n- md5_transform: callee that processes ctx->buffer; its behavior (assumed to read/write MD5_BLOCK_SIZE bytes) matters to confirm that prior memset/padding left a full block and that md5_transform does not rely on extra hidden buffer space.\n- memset / memcpy: the standard functions being checked by the MISRA rule. Their semantics (destination pointer and size arguments computed above) are what must be proven to be in\u2011bounds.\n\nWith these symbols you can compute exact byte counts, pointer targets and which branches compile/run, and thus determine whether any memset/memcpy call can access beyond the referenced objects."
