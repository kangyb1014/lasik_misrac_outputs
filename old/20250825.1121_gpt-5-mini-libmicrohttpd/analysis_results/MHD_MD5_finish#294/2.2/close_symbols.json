  "explanation": "For a sound MISRA-C dead-code analysis of MHD_MD5_finish you must be able to determine which branches and assignments can actually affect program behaviour (and which are removable). Each listed symbol influences control flow, side-effects, sizes, or alignment checks in the function:\n\n- struct Md5Ctx: provides the layout and sizes of fields used by the function; needed to tell whether writes/zeroing are observable and to compute sizeof(struct Md5Ctx).\n- Md5Ctx.count: used to compute bytes_have and num_bits. Whether different values are possible determines reachability of the padding branch (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have < MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD).\n- Md5Ctx.buffer: pointer/array storing partial blocks and final-length placement; needed to know whether writes (padding, length insertion) and md5_transform input are observable.\n- Md5Ctx.H: internal state array written/read and used to produce digest; required to determine if later stores/copies are necessary (affects dead-code decision).\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE: determines block arithmetic and the condition that triggers processing of an extra block; essential to know if that branch can occur.\n- MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD: size of length field appended to final block; used in the branch condition and padding size calculations.\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS: used to compute the location passed to _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE (indexing into buffer); needed to ensure correct placement and side-effects.\n- MD5_DIGEST_SIZE: size used for allocations/copies (memcpy) and to decide if digest copy is a no-op; required to assess if memcpy/remove would change behaviour.\n- MD5_DIGEST_SIZE_WORDS: used to size the temporary aligned digest buffer (alig_dgst[]). If this buffer is never used the aligned-path could be dead.\n- MD5_BYTES_IN_WORD: used when writing digest words to digest[]; affects pointer arithmetic/overlaps and whether writes are redundant.\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE: performs the little-endian length write. Must be known to see if its call has side-effects that cannot be removed.\n- md5_transform: does the core compression; must be considered for side-effects and to determine whether earlier padding/zeroing/memset calls are required. If md5_transform has hidden side-effects removal could break behaviour.\n- _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE: writes 32-bit words in little-endian; its semantics determine whether the aligned/unaligned write-paths are equivalent and therefore whether one path is dead.\n- _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE_UNALIGNED: preprocessor symbol that disables the aligned/unaligned branching; whether it is defined changes compile-time control flow and can render one branch unreachable or dead.\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: affects conditional compilation and whether the code merges the two write-paths; needed to see if one branch is omitted and thus whether the other is necessary.\n- _MHD_UINT32_ALIGN: alignment value used in the runtime alignment test ((uintptr_t) digest) % _MHD_UINT32_ALIGN \u2014 required to decide whether the aligned temporary-copy branch can ever execute for callers' digest pointer alignments.\n- memset: standard function used for zeroing buffer and ctx; must be considered since zeroing ctx at the end could be classified as dead if removing it does not affect observable behaviour (depends on visibility of ctx after call).\n- memcpy: used to copy the aligned temporary digest into the unaligned destination; must be known to decide if that copy is redundant with the direct writes.\n- sizeof(struct Md5Ctx): used in the final memset size; needed to determine if that erase is required or removable.\n- uintptr_t: type used in the alignment test; needed to reason about the arithmetic and alignment result on target platforms.\n\nWith these symbols you can determine: (a) whether the extra-block padding branch is ever taken for reachable ctx->count values, (b) whether the aligned-temp-copy branch is ever used (compile-time macros and runtime alignment), (c) whether the final ctx zeroing or intermediate memsets/memcpy are observable (have side-effects) or removable. Without them you cannot conclude whether particular executed operations are dead code under MISRA C rule (dead code = executed but removable without changing program behaviour)."
