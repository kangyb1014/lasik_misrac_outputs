  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_MD5_finish (or any functions it calls) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp for null-terminated strings, the analyzer must know any direct or indirect uses of memcmp and the context in which byte/ string comparisons or copies occur. The listed symbols are required for that analysis for the following reasons:\n\n- memcmp: The specific Standard Library function restricted by the MISRA rule \u2014 must be checked for direct usage in MHD_MD5_finish and in any callees/macros it invokes.\n- memcpy: Present in MHD_MD5_finish; must be distinguished from memcmp and reviewed to ensure no string-comparison semantics are implemented via copy/compare patterns.\n- memset: Used in MHD_MD5_finish for padding/zeroing; included to fully understand buffer handling and whether any zero-terminated string semantics are involved.\n- md5_transform: A direct callee; its implementation must be inspected to ensure it (or deeper callees) do not call memcmp or otherwise compare null-terminated strings.\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE: A direct callee/macro used to write the length; its implementation could hide memory operations (including memcmp) and affects final buffer contents.\n- _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE and _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE_UNALIGNED: Macros used to store digest words; their definitions must be checked for any memory comparisons or string assumptions.\n- struct Md5Ctx (definition: members count, buffer, H): Needed to understand types and semantics of ctx->buffer and ctx->H (are they byte buffers, words, aligned?), which affects whether any memory operations could be treating data as C strings.\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE, MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD, MD5_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS, MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, MD5_DIGEST_SIZE_WORDS, MD5_BYTES_IN_WORD: Constants control buffer sizes, offsets and padding logic \u2014 required to verify that operations act on raw bytes/binary blocks (not null-terminated strings) and to rule out accidental use of memcmp for C strings.\n- _MHD_UINT32_ALIGN and MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: Compile-time macros that change which code path is taken (temporary aligned buffer + memcpy vs direct writes). Different paths must be checked for memcmp or string comparisons.\n- uint8_t, uint32_t, uint64_t, uintptr_t (type definitions): Type sizes and alignment matter when reasoning about pointer casts, buffer accesses and whether memory operations could be (mis)used for C-string comparisons.\n\nIn short, include the above symbols so the next agent can (1) search for any usage of memcmp in the target and its callees/macros, (2) understand buffering/alignment/size logic that would indicate whether operations work on raw binary blocks or C-style null-terminated strings, and (3) evaluate different conditional compilation paths that might introduce forbidden memcmp usage."
