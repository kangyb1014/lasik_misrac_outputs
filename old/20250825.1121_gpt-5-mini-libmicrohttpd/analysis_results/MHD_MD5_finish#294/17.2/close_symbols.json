  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_MD5_finish can call itself directly or indirectly we must inspect all functions it invokes (transitively) and any helpers used in the function that could introduce calls back to MHD_MD5_finish. The listed symbols are the minimal set to examine:\n\n- md5_transform: Direct callee of MHD_MD5_finish. Any call chain that leads back to MHD_MD5_finish would have to go through md5_transform, so its implementation must be inspected for calls to MHD_MD5_finish or to other functions that could reach MHD_MD5_finish.\n\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE: Direct callee used to write the 64-bit length. Although the static graph shows no callees, its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not call MHD_MD5_finish (or call other functions that do).\n\n- __builtin_rotateleft32: Callee of md5_transform (a compiler builtin). Include it to confirm it does not perform any indirect call back into program functions (in practice builtins do not, but documenting it closes the callee chain).\n\n- _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE: Macro/inline/function used to write 32-bit words into digest in several conditional branches. Its definition must be checked because macros or helper functions could (in theory) expand/implement calls that lead back to MHD_MD5_finish.\n\n- memcpy and memset: Standard library routines used by MHD_MD5_finish. Although in normal environments these will not call user functions, their use should be acknowledged and their usage verified (e.g., if replaced by project-specific wrappers that could call back).\n\nInspecting the bodies (or macro expansions) of these symbols is sufficient to confirm there is no path from MHD_MD5_finish through its callees that returns to MHD_MD5_finish, which would constitute direct or indirect recursion under the MISRA C rule."
