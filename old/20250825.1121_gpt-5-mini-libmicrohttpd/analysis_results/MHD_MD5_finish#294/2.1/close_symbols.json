  "explanation": "- struct Md5Ctx: The structure layout (types and sizes of count, buffer and H) is needed to determine the effects of pointer arithmetic, indexing (bytes_have), where the length is written, and the final memset size \u2014 all affect whether code paths execute or are reachable.\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE: Used in several runtime computations and the key condition (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have < MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD). Its value affects whether the branch that calls md5_transform and resets bytes_have is taken.\n- MD5_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD: Participates in the branch condition that decides whether the current block is completed and processed; its value therefore affects reachability of that entire if-branch and subsequent code.\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS: Used in the pointer passed to _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE; needed to know the pointer arithmetic and whether that write is inside buffer bounds (affects correctness and reachability reasoning if out-of-bounds would cause undefined behavior).\n- MD5_DIGEST_SIZE: Size used for the final memcpy and for the digest array; needed to reason about allocation/sizes and whether the memcpy branch is meaningful.\n- MD5_DIGEST_SIZE_WORDS: Used to size the temporary aligned digest array (alig_dgst); affects whether that local array declaration is valid and whether the aligned-copy branch is possible.\n- MD5_BYTES_IN_WORD: Used to compute offsets into the digest buffer for _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE; needed to reason about addresses used and the alignment/branch logic.\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_LE_SAFE: The callee invoked to write the 64-bit length; its definition may be a macro that expands differently on some platforms (possibly empty or doing unusual things). Knowing its behavior is necessary to decide reachability/side-effects of code around that call.\n- _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE: Macro/function used to store 32-bit words into the digest; its semantics matter for the two alternative branches (aligned temporary + memcpy vs direct writes) and for whether either branch is empty/optimized away.\n- _MHD_PUT_32BIT_LE_UNALIGNED: Compile-time macro that selects which of the code variants is compiled. Its definition determines which conditional blocks exist in the compiled function and therefore which code could be unreachable.\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: Compile-time macro that also changes the conditional structure around the alignment test and branches; required to know which branches are present and reachable in the compiled build.\n- _MHD_UINT32_ALIGN: The alignment constant used in the runtime alignment check (0 != ((uintptr_t)digest) % _MHD_UINT32_ALIGN). Its value (and the alignment of digest at runtime) determines which branch of the alignment-related if is taken; necessary to assess reachability of the aligned-copy branch.\n- md5_transform: This callee is invoked inside branches. Its definition is required because if it had non-returning behavior (e.g., longjmp/noreturn) or side-effects that alter control flow, that would change reachability of subsequent code in MHD_MD5_finish.\n- memset: Standard library function used in multiple places (padding the buffer, clearing ctx); include to confirm it is a normal returning function (i.e., does not affect reachability) and to reason about its sizes/arguments.\n- memcpy: Used for copying the aligned temporary digest into the user buffer; its presence is required to reason about whether the aligned-copy branch is meaningful and reachable.\n\nThese symbols (definitions and compile-time flags) are the minimal additional information needed to determine which conditional and compile-time branches in MHD_MD5_finish are actually present and reachable so that the MISRA C rule about unreachable code can be evaluated accurately."
