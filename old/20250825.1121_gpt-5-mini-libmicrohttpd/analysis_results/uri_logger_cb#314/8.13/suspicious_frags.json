  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const where appropriate or involve objects that must be modifiable by design. Specifically:\n- The 'uri' parameter in uri_logger_cb is already const-qualified.\n- 'buf' in callback is an output/destination buffer that must be writable, so it should not be const.\n- The return value that carries allocated memory is a pointer to newly allocated storage that the caller is expected to manipulate (allocate/free/modify), so const-qualifying that pointer is not necessarily appropriate.\n- The cast of size values to ssize_t and the arithmetic on pos/size_to_copy are unrelated to pointer const qualification.\nTherefore no additional fragments beyond those listed require inspection for Rule 8.13."
