  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA C const-pointer analysis:\n\n1) malloc: You must know the allocation API signature because it determines the type (void *) returned and typical mutability expectations of dynamically allocated memory. Whether the pointer can or should be const depends partly on how the allocated object is intended to be used.\n\n2) gettimeofday: Its prototype shows that it writes into the provided struct timeval via a non-const pointer parameter. Because gettimeofday modifies *tv, the pointer tv within uri_logger_cb cannot be const-qualified at the point it is passed to gettimeofday.\n\n3) struct timeval: The actual definition (fields and types) is needed to determine whether its contents are mutable and whether any of its fields are meant to remain constant; this helps decide if the pointer could be const-qualified after construction or must remain mutable because callers or library APIs write into it.\n\n4) Callback type / registration prototype: uri_logger_cb implements a callback required by some API. The declared callback type in that API defines whether cls and the return type must be non-const (the API may require void * for cls or void * return). If the API signature forces non-const, the function cannot use const-qualified pointers even if local analysis might allow it.\n\n5) All callers of uri_logger_cb: To apply the MISRA rule \u201cpointer should point to const whenever possible\u201d you must see how the returned pointer is used by its callers. If callers only read the pointed-to data, a const-qualified return (or returning pointer-to-const) might be possible; if callers modify or free the object, it must be a non-const pointer.\n\n6) free()/ownership contract or documentation: Knowing who is expected to free or mutate the returned buffer (ownership and lifecycle) is necessary to judge whether the pointer should be const. If the contract expects the caller to modify or free the object, const qualification is inappropriate. Conversely, if the object is immutable after creation and only read, const could be applied.\n\nCollecting these symbols (prototypes, type definitions, callers, and ownership documentation) is sufficient to determine whether any pointer in uri_logger_cb can or should be made a pointer-to-const under the MISRA rule."
