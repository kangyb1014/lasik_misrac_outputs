  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs (static function, void* return and parameter types, malloc, sizeof, NULL, pointer comparison, return) and a POSIX library call (gettimeofday). None of the following extension kinds appear and thus do not need investigation for Rule 1.2: GCC/Clang attributes or builtins (e.g. __attribute__, __builtin_*, __extension__), inline assembly, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, processor-specific intrinsics, or other compiler-specific keywords. The (void) casting of unused parameters is a standard C idiom to suppress warnings, not a compiler extension. Note: gettimeofday is a POSIX library function (platform-specific), but it is a library API, not a compiler language extension; if portability or MISRA library restrictions are a concern those should be checked under other MISRA rules, not Rule 1.2."
