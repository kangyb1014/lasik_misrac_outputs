  "explanation": "- malloc: Its declaration/implementation must be inspected to see if the compiler provides it as a built-in or with compiler-specific attributes or extensions (e.g. __builtin_malloc, non\u2011standard attributes). If malloc is a compiler builtin, that could be a language extension relevant to the MISRA rule.  \n- gettimeofday: This is not part of ISO C; its presence could indicate use of POSIX APIs. We need the symbol/declaration to determine whether gettimeofday is provided by the compiler as an extension or only by the platform C library (i.e. not a compiler language extension).  \n- struct timeval: The function allocates and returns a pointer to this structure; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not rely on any compiler language extensions (for example, non\u2011standard field declarations, unnamed/anonymous members that some compilers treat as extensions).  \n- NULL: The macro/definition of NULL should be checked (it can be defined using compiler\u2011specific tokens in some toolchains) to ensure it is standard and not a compiler extension.  \n- size_t: Used in the malloc prototype; its typedef/definition should be examined because some toolchains may provide non\u2011standard typedefs or compiler\u2011specific aliases (or treat related builtins specially).  \n\nThese symbols cover the external declarations and types referenced by the target function; inspecting their definitions or how the compiler supplies them is necessary to decide whether the code relies on compiler language extensions (the subject of the MISRA rule)."
