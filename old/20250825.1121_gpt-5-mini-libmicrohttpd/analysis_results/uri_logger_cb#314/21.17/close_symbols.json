  "explanation": "- malloc: The function calls malloc. To prove no string.h function is used you must inspect malloc's declaration/definition (or any macro wrapper) in the translation unit or linked headers to ensure it does not expand to or call memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc. (some environments provide wrappers/macros around allocation).\n- gettimeofday: The function calls gettimeofday. Verify its declaration or any macro wrapper to ensure it is not implemented as or expanded to a call that uses string-handling functions.\n- struct timeval: sizeof(struct timeval) is used to compute the allocation size. The definition is required to confirm sizeof is well-formed and that no hidden string operations are involved (and to rule out any unusual macro redefinitions of the type name).\n- NULL: NULL is used; inspect its definition only to ensure it is not a macro that expands to an expression that could invoke string functions.\n\nNote: The parameters cls and uri are unused in this function, so their types/definitions are not needed for determining violations of the string-handling rule in this function (unless macros elsewhere reference them). The listed symbols are sufficient to check whether any of the called/used entities could hide or expand to uses of the string.h functions named by the MISRA rule."
