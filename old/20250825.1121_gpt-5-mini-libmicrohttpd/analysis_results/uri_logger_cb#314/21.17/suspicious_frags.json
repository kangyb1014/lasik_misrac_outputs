  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) and accesses beyond the bounds of objects passed to them. The provided function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions and does not perform any string or memory-copy/compare/concatenation operations. The uses of malloc and gettimeofday operate on the allocated object within its allocated size and do not involve string handling; the (void) casts silence unused-parameter warnings and are not related to string operations. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and nothing needs to be investigated for that rule."
