  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function appear to be direct or indirect recursive and thus do not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Reasoning:\n- The function body contains only calls to malloc and gettimeofday; neither call invokes user-defined callbacks nor references uri_logger_cb, so there is no direct call to itself.\n- There are no function-pointer dereferences or calls in the function body that could cause indirect recursion (no calls like fp(...)).\n- The parameters cls and uri are unused (explicitly cast to void), so they cannot carry a function pointer that might cause an indirect call into uri_logger_cb.\n- There are no global or static variables accessed that could hold a function pointer invoking this function.\n- The function does not spawn threads or register callbacks that could later re-enter this function.\n\nGiven the above, nothing in this fragment suggests direct or indirect self-calls; therefore no suspicious fragments are reported."
