  "explanation": "- malloc: The target function calls malloc. To prove there is no indirect recursion you must examine malloc's definition / static call graph (or any project-specific allocator wrapper that resolves to malloc) to ensure malloc does not (directly or indirectly) call uri_logger_cb.\n- gettimeofday: The target function calls gettimeofday. You must examine gettimeofday's definition / static call graph (or any project-specific time function wrapper that resolves to it) to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call uri_logger_cb.\n\nNote: uri_logger_cb does not call any function pointers or other project functions directly, so the only transitive call paths to inspect start from these two calls. If your build uses replacement/wrapper functions (e.g., project-specific allocation or time APIs that map to different symbols), include those wrapper symbols' call graphs as well."
