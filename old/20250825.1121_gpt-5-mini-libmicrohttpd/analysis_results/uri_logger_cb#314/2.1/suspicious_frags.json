  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the provided function. Every statement can be executed in normal control flow:\n- The allocation line (struct timeval *tv = malloc(...)) is executed on every call.\n- The (void) cls and (void) uri lines are no-op evaluations used to suppress unused-parameter warnings; they are reachable and executed (they evaluate their operands and discard the result).\n- The conditional if (NULL != tv) gettimeofday(tv, NULL); is reachable; whether its body executes depends on the runtime result of malloc, which is valid behavior and not unreachable code.\n- The return tv; is the final statement and is reachable on all code paths.\nThere is no code after the return, no always-false conditional that makes following statements unreachable, and no other constructs that create dead/unreachable code. Therefore no fragments require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
