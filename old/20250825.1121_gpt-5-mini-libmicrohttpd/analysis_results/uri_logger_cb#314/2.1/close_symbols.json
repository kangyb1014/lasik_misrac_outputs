  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is needed for unreachable-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- malloc (project/prototype/definition): The analysis must know the actual behaviour/prototype/attributes of malloc in this project (can it return NULL, does it have attributes such as noreturn, or is it replaced by a wrapper that aborts on failure). If malloc is guaranteed non-NULL or is noreturn on failure, the condition (NULL != tv) or subsequent code paths may be provably always/never taken, creating or removing unreachable branches.\n\n- gettimeofday (project/prototype/definition): The real declaration/definition (or macro) is needed to see if it has attributes (e.g. noreturn) or side effects that affect reachability. If gettimeofday never returns (or is redirected to a function that does not return), the following return statement would be unreachable.\n\n- struct timeval (type definition): The sizeof(struct timeval) must be resolvable to ensure malloc invocation is well-formed in this translation unit. While not usually affecting control flow, an incomplete or unusual definition could change compilation or be accompanied by project-specific behaviours that influence reachability reasoning.\n\n- NULL macro definition: The exact definition of NULL in this project (macro) is required to ensure the pointer comparison semantics are standard and to determine whether the comparison (NULL != tv) is meaningful or could be optimized away by project-specific macro definitions.\n\n- All callers of uri_logger_cb (from the project static call graph): MISRA's prohibition on unreachable code applies to code that is never reachable from any entry point. To decide whether the function body itself (or any part of it) is unreachable in the project, we must know if uri_logger_cb is invoked anywhere in the project; include the list of callers from the static call graph.\n\n- Any project-specific macros/wrappers that replace or alias malloc or gettimeofday (in this TU or globally): Projects sometimes #define or inline-wrap standard functions. Such replacements can change semantics (e.g. always return non-NULL, abort on error, add noreturn), which directly affects whether branches in this function are reachable. Include any such definitions visible in the translation unit or globally.\n\nInclude these concrete symbol definitions (prototypes/macros/type definitions and the caller list) in the next-agent prompt so it can determine whether any branch or the function itself is provably unreachable."
