  "explanation": "- malloc: The target function calls malloc. To prove the function does not (directly or indirectly) use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings you must inspect malloc and any wrapper/implementation it maps to (macro or replacement function) to ensure it does not call memcmp or otherwise perform string comparisons.\n- gettimeofday: The function calls gettimeofday. Its implementation (or any wrapper/macro used in this build) must be checked for any use of memcmp on NUL-terminated strings; include its prototype/definition.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule under inspection refers directly to memcmp. You must have the memcmp symbol/definition (or any alias/wrapper) available so you can detect any uses (direct or indirect) in the call tree reachable from uri_logger_cb.\n- struct timeval: The target allocates sizeof(struct timeval) and passes a struct timeval* to gettimeofday. You need the type definition to confirm the allocation size and how the buffer is used (ensures no accidental treatment as a string buffer leading to memcmp on character arrays).\n- NULL: NULL is used in the function and may be a macro that could expand to something unexpected in some environments; include its definition to rule out any hidden behavior.\n\nNote: The above list is minimal for proving that uri_logger_cb does not violate the memcmp-on-strings MISRA rule. In practice you should also inspect any build-time wrappers, libc substitutes, or static inline functions/macros that replace the listed symbols, and any other functions in the static call graph if present."
