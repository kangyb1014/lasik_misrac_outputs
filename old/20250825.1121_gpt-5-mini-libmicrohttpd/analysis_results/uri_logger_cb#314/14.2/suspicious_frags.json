First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the form and contents of for loops (first/second/third clauses, single loop counter, side-effects in the test or iteration expressions, and modifications inside the loop body or called functions). Since uri_logger_cb contains no for loop and no macros or inline constructs that expand to a for loop, there are no code fragments in this function that are relevant to Rule 14.2 and thus nothing to investigate under that rule. Other constructs in the function (malloc, gettimeofday, unused-parameter casts, NULL checks, returning the allocated pointer) are unrelated to the requirements of Rule 14.2."
