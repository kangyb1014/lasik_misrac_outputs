Removing it does not change the program behaviour, so it is an executed operation whose removal would not affect behaviour \u2014 i.e. dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Although commonly used to suppress unused-parameter warnings, the statement itself qualifies as dead code.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function uri_logger_cb:\nenum MHD_AuthType type\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. While the statement \u201c(void) uri;\u201d is an expression statement that has no side effects and whose removal would not change program behaviour in the functional sense, the idiom is commonly used to document and intentionally suppress unused-parameter warnings. MISRA\u2019s intent in prohibiting dead code is to eliminate genuinely redundant, unneeded operations that should not be present in a production project; MISRA tooling and guidance treat explicit casts-to-void used to mark parameters as intentionally unused as an acceptable way to record intent and silence warnings. In short, this cast-to-void is an intentional unused-parameter annotation and is not considered a violation of Rule 2.2 in normal MISRA practice. If a project\u2019s interpretation of Rule 2.2 is stricter, this could be treated as a justified deviation, but the agent A\u2019s blanket claim that the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
