Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of uri_logger_cb.\n```c\nstatic void *\nuri_logger_cb (void *cls,\n               const char *uri)\n{\n  struct timeval *tv = malloc (sizeof (struct timeval));\n  (void) cls; /* Unused.

  "explanation": "The statement \u201c(void) cls;\u201d is an expression statement that is executed at runtime but has no observable effect (it merely evaluates and discards the parameter). Removing that statement would not change the program\u2019s behaviour, so by the literal wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 it is dead code. The same applies to \u201c(void) uri;\u201d. Note: although this idiom is commonly used to suppress compiler warnings about unused parameters and is often accepted in practice, it nonetheless matches the rule\u2019s definition of dead code unless an explicit project-approved justification or exemption is provided."
