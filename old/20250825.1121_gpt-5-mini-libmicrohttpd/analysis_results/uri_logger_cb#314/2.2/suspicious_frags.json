  "explanation": "The other operations in the function are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA Rule 2.2: allocating memory with malloc and returning the pointer is observable behavior (the caller receives the pointer), the conditional check (if (NULL != tv)) prevents a potential NULL dereference and affects control flow, and gettimeofday(tv, NULL) writes observable state into the allocated object that is returned to the caller. These statements therefore affect program behaviour and should be investigated for correctness but are not dead code. The only operations that are no-ops (and whose removal would not change program behaviour) are the explicit void-casts of the unused parameters, which are listed above."
