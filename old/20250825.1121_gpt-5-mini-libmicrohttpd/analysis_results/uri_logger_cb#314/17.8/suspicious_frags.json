  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The parameters are: 'void *cls' and 'const char *uri'. The lines '(void) cls;' and '(void) uri;' merely cast the parameters to void to suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not alter the parameter values. There are no assignments to 'cls' or 'uri' (e.g. 'cls = ...' or 'uri = ...'), nor any operations that rebind those pointer variables. The only pointer that is assigned and returned is the local variable 'struct timeval *tv' (allocated with malloc and passed to gettimeofday), which is not a function parameter. Therefore no fragments violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no further investigation is required."
