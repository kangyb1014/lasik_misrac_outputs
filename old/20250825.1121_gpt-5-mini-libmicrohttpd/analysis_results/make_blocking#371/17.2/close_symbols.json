  "explanation": "To determine whether make_blocking participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect all functions that can call it and the transitive callees those functions invoke: \n- send_all: It is a direct caller of make_blocking (per the call graph). Analyze send_all to see whether it calls any functions that could eventually call make_blocking, forming an indirect cycle.\n- run_usock: It is another direct caller of make_blocking and itself calls multiple functions. Its body must be checked for call paths that return to make_blocking (either directly or via other functions).\n- ws_send_frame: Appears in the call graph as called by run_usock and as a caller of send_all. Inspecting ws_send_frame is necessary because it could call send_all (or others) and produce a cycle back to make_blocking.\n- ws_receive_frame: Called by run_usock; it might call ws_send_frame, send_all, or other functions that lead back to make_blocking. Include it to cover those transitive paths.\n- MHD_upgrade_action: Called by run_usock; include it because it could call back into run_usock, send_all, or other functions that eventually invoke make_blocking, creating indirect recursion.\n\nNote: low-level system calls used inside make_blocking (abort, fcntl, ioctlsocket) are irrelevant to the recursion/MISRA rule and are omitted. The listed symbols are the minimal additional program-level functions needed to verify whether any call path leads from make_blocking back to itself."
