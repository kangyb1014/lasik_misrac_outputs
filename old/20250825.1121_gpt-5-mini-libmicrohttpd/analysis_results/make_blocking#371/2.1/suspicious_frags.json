  "explanation": "I only flagged code regions that are conditionally compiled out given the provided project-level macros. In the additional code you supplied MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS is defined and there are no definitions for _WIN32, __CYGWIN__ or SIZEOF_SIZE_T; therefore the alternative preprocessor branches guarded by those macros are compile-time excluded and should be investigated as potentially unreachable. Other parts of the code were not flagged because they are in the active compilation path or are reachable depending on runtime data (for example: branches that depend on values read from the socket, mutex lock/unlock/error handling, normal loops and conditionals). Runtime-dependent branches are not compile-time unreachable and thus do not need to be reported here for MISRA Rule 2.1 investigation based on the provided macro set."
