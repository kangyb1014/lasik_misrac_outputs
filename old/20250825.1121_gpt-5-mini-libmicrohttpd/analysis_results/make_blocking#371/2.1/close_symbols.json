  "explanation": "For determining whether make_blocking contains unreachable code you must know both which lines are actually compiled and whether they can ever execute at run time. The required symbols are:\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS: controls the #if branch. If defined, the POSIX branch is compiled; if not, that branch is absent (the other branch or nothing might be compiled). Necessary to decide which source lines exist in the translation unit (compile\u2011time reachability).\n\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: controls the #elif branch. Same reason as above: whether the Winsock branch is present in the compiled code.\n\n- O_NONBLOCK: the bitmask used in the runtime test ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags). Its numeric value (and whether it can be zero) affects whether the inner conditional can be true or is provably always false (compile\u2011time / constant propagation implications for reachability of the inner fcntl+abort path).\n\n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL: constants used with fcntl. Needed to understand the meaning of fcntl calls and whether any of these could be resolved to constant expressions that make code unreachable.\n\n- FIONBIO: constant used with ioctlsocket in the Winsock branch; required to reason about that branch's semantics and whether that code can be reached or is a no\u2011op.\n\n- fcntl: the POSIX runtime function used to read/set flags. Its runtime behaviour (possible return values, error conditions, side effects) is required to decide whether the inner conditional and the abort() call can actually be reached.\n\n- ioctlsocket: the Winsock runtime function called in the Winsock branch; needed to determine whether that branch can fail/execute and thus whether the abort() there is reachable.\n\n- abort: called in error cases. To decide whether statements lead to program termination (and thus whether subsequent code is unreachable after a call) the semantics of abort must be known (standard, but include it explicitly).\n\n- MHD_socket: the typedef / underlying type for fd. On some platforms this may affect which API (fcntl vs ioctlsocket) is appropriate; also relevant to whether the compiled code can even compile/execute on the target platform.\n\n- send_all, run_usock, ws_send_frame, ws_receive_frame: callers (from the static call graph). To decide whether the entire function body is unreachable in the project you must check whether any compiled code calls make_blocking. Those caller functions (and the conditional compilation that surrounds them, if any) are needed to establish cross\u2011translation unit / project reachability of make_blocking.\n\nIn short: the platform/build macros determine which branch is present at compile time; the constants and API functions determine whether runtime conditionals can ever be true (and thus whether inner statements are reachable); the callers determine whether the function itself is ever invoked in the built project. These symbols are the minimal set required to decide if any statements in make_blocking are unreachable under MISRA's \"no unreachable code\" rule."
