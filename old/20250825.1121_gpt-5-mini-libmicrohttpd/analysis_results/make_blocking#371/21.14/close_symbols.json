  "explanation": "For deciding whether make_blocking violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you need: \n\n- memcmp: the exact symbol the MISRA rule targets \u2014 must be inspected project\u2011wide to see any uses in the target or in reachable functions.\n\n- send_all, run_usock, ws_send_frame, ws_receive_frame, MHD_upgrade_action: callers and nearby functions from the static call graph. Even if make_blocking itself does not call memcmp, a complete compliance check should inspect functions in the call chain (callers and closely related callees) for prohibited memcmp usage or wrappers that might compare C strings with memcmp.\n\n- fcntl, ioctlsocket, abort, O_NONBLOCK, F_GETFL, F_SETFL, FIONBIO, MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS, MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS, MHD_socket: symbols and macros used directly by make_blocking. They are required to fully understand the implementation, conditional compilation, and platform variations of make_blocking so you can confidently determine that make_blocking itself does not perform any string comparisons with memcmp (these symbols are not directly related to the memcmp rule but are necessary context for the function under analysis)."
