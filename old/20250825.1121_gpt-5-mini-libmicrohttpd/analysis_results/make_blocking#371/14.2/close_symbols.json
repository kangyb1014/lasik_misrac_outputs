The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed for MISRA 'well-formed for' analysis of make_blocking:\n\n- fcntl: Called by make_blocking; must be checked for side effects (it modifies file descriptor flags). If a caller uses a loop counter that could be affected by fcntl (or if fcntl has side-effects on objects visible to a loop), that matters for clause 2/3. Also needed to confirm fcntl does not modify loop counters.\n\n- ioctlsocket: Windows equivalent of fcntl called by make_blocking; same reasons as fcntl (possible side-effects on objects passed in). Required to reason about side-effects when make_blocking is invoked inside a for loop in callers.\n\n- abort: Called by make_blocking on error paths. Its behaviour (terminating the program) is relevant to understand whether control flow inside any for loop calling make_blocking can have side-effects that affect loop well-formedness.\n\n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK, FIONBIO: Macros/constants used to compute/modify socket flags. Needed to confirm which object(s) are modified (socket flag fields) and to ensure these are not loop counters or objects used as loop control in callers.\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS, MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: Conditional-compilation macros determine which code path is compiled. To analyze the concrete code seen by a build (and thus whether any for-loop interactions exist), the agent must know which of these macros is defined.\n\n- MHD_socket: The type of fd; knowing whether this is an integer, SOCKET, or some wrapper helps determine what objects make_blocking modifies (e.g., kernel FD state vs user-visible object) and whether those could be loop counters in callers.\n\n- send_all, run_usock, ws_send_frame: These are callers (send_all and run_usock directly call make_blocking; ws_send_frame calls send_all). MISRA's text includes the behaviour of functions called within a for-loop body, and conversely a caller may contain for loops whose bodies call make_blocking. To decide whether make_blocking causes violation of the 'for' rule in contexts where it is invoked inside a for loop, the caller code must be examined for loop counters and for whether make_blocking modifies those objects or has side-effects relevant to clauses 2\u20134.\n\nIn short: include the direct/indirect callers so any for-loops that invoke make_blocking can be inspected, include the system calls and macros used inside make_blocking to determine its side-effects and which objects it modifies, and include the conditional macros and socket type to know the exact compiled path and affected objects."
