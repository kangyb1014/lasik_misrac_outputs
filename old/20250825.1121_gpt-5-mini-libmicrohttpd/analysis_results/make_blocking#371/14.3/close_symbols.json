  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why it is needed to decide if any controlling expression is invariant):\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS\n  - Determines which compile-time branch is selected. The preprocessor #if/#elif are compile\u2011time controls; the analyzer must know which branch is active to see which runtime controlling expressions exist.\n\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS\n  - Same as above: selects the Windows path. If this is defined the only runtime controlling expression to check is the ioctlsocket call; if not defined the POSIX path is compiled.\n\n- fcntl\n  - The value of the local variable flags comes directly from fcntl(fd, F_GETFL). To determine whether expressions that use flags (e.g. \"-1 == flags\" and \"(flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags\") can be invariant, the analyzer must treat fcntl as an external function whose return behavior (possibly variable at runtime) is known or conservatively modeled. If fcntl were a constant/macro or provably constant in the build, the controlling expressions could become invariant.\n\n- F_GETFL\n  - Argument to fcntl that determines which value is requested. Its meaning can affect whether fcntl is expected to return varying values; include it to map fcntl semantics in the target environment.\n\n- F_SETFL\n  - Used in the second fcntl call; needed to reason about whether the fcntl(F_SETFL, ...) call can return a constant error code (which would make a following conditional invariant) or whether it can vary at runtime.\n\n- O_NONBLOCK\n  - Appears in the bitwise expression (flags & ~O_NONBLOCK). If O_NONBLOCK has a special value (for example 0) this expression can simplify to a compile\u2011time invariant ((flags & ~0) == flags). The exact numeric value/definition is required to decide whether the controlling expression can be reduced to an invariant.\n\n- ioctlsocket\n  - In the Windows branch the controlling expression is (0 != ioctlsocket(...)). The analyzer must know that ioctlsocket is an external API that returns a runtime result (and what semantics/return values it has). If ioctlsocket were a constant macro or otherwise provably constant, the expression could be invariant.\n\n- FIONBIO\n  - Argument to ioctlsocket, affects the call and its semantics; if FIONBIO had a value that made ioctlsocket a no-op or otherwise provably constant in this build, the controlling expression could become invariant.\n\n- MHD_socket\n  - Type/typedef of the fd parameter can influence which API is actually used (POSIX int descriptor vs Windows SOCKET) and whether the calls to fcntl/ioctlsocket are well\u2011formed. Knowing the type is needed to determine whether the calls are mapped to runtime APIs (variable results) or to some compile\u2011time constant/macro.\n\nNotes:\n- abort is not required to decide invariance of the controlling expressions \u2014 it is just the consequence when a condition holds. The important symbols are the external functions/macros that produce the values used in the controlling expressions and the compile\u2011time selection macros that determine which expressions exist in the compiled code.\n- The analyzer should treat external functions (fcntl, ioctlsocket) conservatively as producing non\u2011invariant results unless project headers/links prove them constant in the build. Likewise, check numeric definitions of O_NONBLOCK and FIONBIO to see if they cause boolean reductions to invariants."
