  "explanation": "I selected all controlling expressions in the function (preprocessor conditionals and C if-statements) because Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions. The remaining lines (variable declarations/assignments, calls to fcntl/ioctlsocket, abort(), #endif, function header/closing brace) are not controlling expressions or are dependent on runtime results and so do not by themselves indicate an invariant controlling expression that would violate Rule 14.3. The listed fragments should be investigated to determine whether any of those controlling expressions are effectively constant in the build or at runtime."
