  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d we must know whether the parameter fd is an object that can be (or appears to be) modified by operations in make_blocking. The listed symbols are needed for that determination: \n\n- MHD_socket: the typedef/definition of MHD_socket is required to know whether fd is an integer/scalar or a pointer type. The rule treats pointer parameters differently (the object pointed-to may be modified but the pointer itself shall not). Knowing the actual type is essential.\n- fcntl: the prototype/definition of fcntl is required to verify whether it takes fd by value (normal case: int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ...)) or by pointer/indirect reference. If fcntl accepted a pointer to fd or otherwise modified the caller's fd variable, that would violate the rule. Confirming the signature shows it does not modify the parameter variable.\n- ioctlsocket: similarly, the prototype for ioctlsocket (e.g. SOCKET ioctlsocket(SOCKET s, long cmd, u_long *argp) on Windows) is needed to confirm the socket parameter is passed by value and not modified by the call.\n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK, FIONBIO: these macros/constants determine which fcntl/ioctlsocket commands/flags are used. While they do not themselves modify fd, they are necessary to confirm the calls are standard flag/command values (and to rule out some exotic macro that could expand into code that modifies fd).\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS and MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: the conditional-compilation macros determine which branch of the function is compiled. To conclude whether fd is modified in the built configuration, the analyzer must know which branch applies.\n- abort: the declaration of abort is not directly related to modifying fd, but including it lets the analyzer see that the function calls abort on error rather than attempting to assign to fd or perform other side effects on the parameter.\n\nWith the above symbols (type of fd and the exact prototypes/definitions of the called functions and macros), an analyzer can determine whether any operation in make_blocking writes to the parameter variable fd itself (which would breach MISRA), or only uses fd as a by-value argument or modifies objects pointed to by pointer parameters (which is allowed)."
