  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The parameter fd is not modified in this function: there are no assignments to fd, no increments/decrements, and its address is never taken (no &fd). fd is passed by value to fcntl/ioctlsocket, which does not modify the parameter variable itself. The only objects modified via pointers are local variables (flags in the WINSOCK branch), which is permitted because Rule 17.8 allows modification of the object pointed to by a pointer parameter \u2014 and here no pointer parameter is involved. Therefore no code fragments require investigation for Rule 17.8."
