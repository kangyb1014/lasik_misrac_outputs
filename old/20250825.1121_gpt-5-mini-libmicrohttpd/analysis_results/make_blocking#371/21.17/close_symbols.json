  "explanation": "For a MISRA C string-handling violation check we must be sure the target function does not (directly or indirectly, via inlined/wrapper implementations) call any of the <string.h> functions or otherwise perform out-of-bounds memory/string accesses. The symbols below are needed to make that determination and why:\n\n- fcntl: The function called in the POSIX branch. We must inspect its declaration/definition (or any project wrapper with the same name) to ensure it is not an in-project function that calls string.h functions or performs string/ buffer operations that could go out-of-bounds.\n\n- ioctlsocket: The function called in the Winsock branch. Same rationale as fcntl: verify there is no in-project wrapper/inline implementation that uses string.h functions.\n\n- abort: Called on error paths. Inspecting its declaration/possible project wrapper ensures it is the standard abort (no project string operations) or else identify any project-specific behavior that would matter for the MISRA rule.\n\n- MHD_socket: The typedef of the fd parameter. Knowing its actual type (int, SOCKET, etc.) is necessary to match the correct platform API (fcntl vs ioctlsocket) and to detect any project wrappers/overloads that might use string functions.\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS and MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: These compile-time macros determine which branch of make_blocking is compiled. To know which code path to analyze (and therefore which functions/macros matter), you must know which of these is defined in the build.\n\n- O_NONBLOCK, F_GETFL, F_SETFL, FIONBIO: These macros/constants are used in bitwise/IOCTL operations in the function. Their definitions (from system or project headers) must be checked to ensure they are simple integer constants and not defined via any macros that expand to expressions or helper functions that use string.h operations.\n\n- <fcntl.h> (or the platform header that declares fcntl and the F_* macros): The header-level declarations and any inline macros/wrappers must be inspected to ensure there are no hidden string operations introduced by project-specific headers.\n\n- <winsock2.h> (or the platform header that declares ioctlsocket and FIONBIO): Same rationale as <fcntl.h> but for the Winsock path.\n\n- <stdlib.h> (abort prototype): Confirms abort is the standard library function; if the project provides its own abort wrapper, that wrapper must be inspected for string operations.\n\nNote: The target function body itself contains no direct calls to functions from <string.h>. The symbols above are needed to rule out indirect uses (project wrappers, inline replacements, macro expansions) or to determine which branch is compiled so that a reviewer can limit the analysis to the relevant platform path."
