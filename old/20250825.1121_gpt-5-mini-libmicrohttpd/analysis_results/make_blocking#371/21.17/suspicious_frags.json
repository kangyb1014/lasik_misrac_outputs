  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions are present in the provided code. The function make_blocking only calls fcntl, ioctlsocket and abort and manipulates integer flag variables (bitwise operations and assignment). There are no character buffers, pointer-to-char parameters, or calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn or any other string-handling routine that could access beyond object bounds. The conditional compilation covers POSIX and WinSock APIs but neither branch uses string functions. Therefore Rule 21.17 (bounds accesses via <string.h> functions) is not applicable and there are no suspicious fragments to report."
