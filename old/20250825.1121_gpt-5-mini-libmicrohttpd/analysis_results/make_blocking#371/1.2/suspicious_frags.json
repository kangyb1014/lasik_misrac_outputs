  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragments present are plain, standard-C constructs: a static function definition, preprocessor conditional compilation (#if defined / #elif / #endif), typedef use (MHD_socket as int), local variable declarations, standard casts ((int) FIONBIO), calls to platform/library functions (fcntl, ioctlsocket, abort), integer/bitwise operations, and macro symbols (F_GETFL, O_NONBLOCK, F_SETFL, FIONBIO). None of these are compiler-specific language extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions, __extension__ or other compiler-only keywords/constructs. The use of POSIX vs WinSock API identifiers (fcntl/FIONBIO/ioctlsocket) reflects platform-specific APIs, not language extensions; they are conditional on macros and therefore outside the scope of MISRA C Rule 1.2 (which targets compiler language extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2."
