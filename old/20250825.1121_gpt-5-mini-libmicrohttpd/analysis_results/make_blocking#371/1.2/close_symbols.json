  "explanation": "To determine whether make_blocking uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule about language extensions), the analyzer needs the definitions and origins of all platform/type/function/macros used in the function:\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS, MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: conditional-compilation macros control which API is compiled. Knowing how these are defined (or which is active) is required to know which code path to inspect for extensions.\n\n- MHD_socket: typedef for the socket parameter \u2014 its underlying type (e.g. int, SOCKET, uintptr_t) may reveal nonstandard typedefs or compiler-specific types.\n\n- fcntl: POSIX system call used in the POSIX branch. The analyzer must know whether this is a standard library/POSIX API or implemented via compiler-specific extension.\n\n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK: macros used with fcntl. Their definitions (from system headers) are needed to ensure they are normal macros/constants and not compiler-specific language extensions.\n\n- abort: standard C library function. Confirming it is the standard abort (stdlib.h) rules out use of nonstandard extension.\n\n- ioctlsocket: Windows/WinSock API used in the Winsock branch. Its origin (winsock headers) must be checked \u2014 it's a platform API, not a C language extension, but the analyzer must see that no compiler-specific construct is hidden behind it.\n\n- FIONBIO: macro used with ioctlsocket; its definition must be inspected (type/expansion) to ensure no extension is involved.\n\n- <fcntl.h>, <winsock2.h>, <stdlib.h>: headers where the above symbols/macros are defined. The analyzer should consult these headers to see whether any of the referenced identifiers rely on compiler-specific extensions (for example compiler-supplied nonstandard macros, attributes, or language extensions) or are standard POSIX/Win32/C library items.\n\nCollectively these symbols (and their header definitions) let the next agent determine whether any of the identifiers or their usages rely on compiler language extensions rather than standard C or documented platform APIs."
