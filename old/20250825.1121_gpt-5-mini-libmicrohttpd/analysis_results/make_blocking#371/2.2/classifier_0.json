The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of make_blocking:\n```c\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function make_blocking:\n#define MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS 1\n...\ntypedef int MHD_socket\n...\nstatic void\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock,\n          const char *buf,\n          size_t len)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t off;\n\n  make_blocking (sock);\n  for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n    ret = send (sock,\n                &buf[off],\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n                len - off,\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n                (int) (len - off),\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n                0);\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n      break;\n  }\n}\n...\nstatic void *\nrun_usock (void *cls)\n{\n  struct MyData *md = cls;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = md->urh;\n  char buf[128];\n  ssize_t got;\n\n  make_blocking (md->sock);\n  /* start by sending extra data MHD may have already read, if any */\n  if (0 != md->extra_in_size)\n  {\n    send_all (md->sock,\n              md->extra_in,\n              md->extra_in_size);\n    free (md->extra_in);\n  }\n  /* now echo in a loop */\n  while (1)\n  {\n    got = recv (md->sock,\n                buf,\n                sizeof (buf),\n                0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n      break;\n    send_all (md->sock,\n              buf,\n              (size_t) got);\n  }\n  free (md);\n  MHD_upgrade_action (urh,\n                      MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE);\n  return NULL;\n}\n...\nstatic ssize_t\nws_send_frame (MHD_socket sock, const char *msg, size_t length)\n{\n  unsigned char *response;\n  unsigned char frame[10];\n  unsigned char idx_first_rdata;\n  size_t idx_response;\n  size_t output;\n  MHD_socket isock;\n  size_t i;\n\n  frame[0] = (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME);\n  if (length <= 125)\n  {\n    frame[1] = length & 0x7F;\n    idx_first_rdata = 2;\n  }\n#if SIZEOF_SIZE_T > 4\n  else if (0xFFFF < length)\n  {\n    frame[1] = 127;\n    frame[2] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 56) & 0xFF);\n    frame[3] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 48) & 0xFF);\n    frame[4] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 40) & 0xFF);\n    frame[5] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 32) & 0xFF);\n    frame[6] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 24) & 0xFF);\n    frame[7] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 16) & 0xFF);\n    frame[8] = (unsigned char) ((length >> 8) & 0xFF);\n    frame[9] = (unsigned char) (length & 0xFF);\n    idx_first_rdata = 10;\n  }\n#endif /* SIZEOF_SIZE_T > 4 */\n  else\n  {\n    frame[1] = 126;\n    frame[2] = (length >> 8) & 0xFF;\n    frame[3] = length & 0xFF;\n    idx_first_rdata = 4;\n  }\n  idx_response = 0;\n  response = malloc (idx_first_rdata + length + 1);\n  if (NULL == response)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < idx_first_rdata; i++)\n  {\n    response[i] = frame[i];\n    idx_response++;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < length; i++)\n  {\n    response[idx_response] = (unsigned char) msg[i];\n    idx_response++;\n  }\n  response[idx_response] = '\\0';\n  output = 0;\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)\n  {\n    isock = CLIENT_SOCKS[i];\n    if ((isock != MHD_INVALID_SOCKET) && (isock != sock))\n    {\n      output += send_all (isock, response, idx_response);\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_unlock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  free (response);\n  return (ssize_t) output;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\noutput += send_all (isock, response, idx_response);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No violation of Rule 2.2. The call to send_all(...) performs observable side-effects (sends data on a socket and frees memory elsewhere), so removing the call would change program behaviour. Note: the provided code shows an inconsistency \u2014 send_all is defined as returning void but its value is used in the expression 'output += send_all(...)', which is a separate correctness/compile-time issue (type/return-value mismatch) and should be fixed. This is not a dead-code violation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
