The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I limited the reported fragments to operations that appear superfluous or inconsistent in the provided code and therefore warrant investigation for potential dead code. Other fragments were not reported because they perform observable effects that are necessary for correct behaviour and thus are unlikely to be dead code: \n\n- The make_blocking implementation (both POSIX and Winsock branches) changes socket blocking mode via system calls; removing these calls would change I/O timing and behaviour, so they must be investigated for correctness but are not obviously dead. \n\n- The send_all loop performs actual send calls and handles partial sends, errors (including EAGAIN), and loop termination; those assignments and control-flow statements affect behaviour (progress of off, error handling) and are not removable without changing semantics. \n\n- The ws_send_frame construction of the WebSocket frame header (frame[0], frame[1], and the multi-byte length branches) and the loops that copy header and payload into the response buffer are necessary to build correct frames; the index updates (idx_response increments, and payload copy loop) are required for correct sizing and cannot be simply removed. \n\n- The mutex lock/unlock and abort() calls affect concurrency and error handling and are not dead. \n\n- The free() calls release allocated memory and are required to avoid leaks; they are not dead code. \n\nThe three fragments reported above are the parts that appear to be executed yet unnecessary or inconsistent in the given snippets (extra byte allocated/terminated but not sent, and use of send_all's return value while the provided send_all definition is void), so they should be investigated further for compliance with MISRA C Rule 2.2."
