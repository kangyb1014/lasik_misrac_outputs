  "suspicious_frags": [
    "  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();"
  ],
  "explanation": "Only the ioctlsocket call passes the address of a local non-const object (&flags) and thus is the only pointer usage that could raise concern under Rule 8.13. The POSIX branch uses fcntl with value returns and integer flags passed/returned by value (no pointer-to-non-const is involved). The function parameter MHD_socket fd is not a pointer in this code. abort() calls do not involve pointers. Therefore no other fragments require investigation for Rule 8.13."
