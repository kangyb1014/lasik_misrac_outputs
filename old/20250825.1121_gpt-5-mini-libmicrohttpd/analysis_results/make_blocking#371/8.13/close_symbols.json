  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for MISRA C rule analysis:\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS / MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: determine which compilation branch is active. The presence/absence of pointer usage and whether ioctlsocket or fcntl is exercised depends on these build macros.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef): determine whether the parameter fd is an integer type or a pointer type. If MHD_socket were a pointer type, MISRA const-qualified-pointer concerns could apply to the fd parameter itself.\n\n- fcntl (function prototype): fcntl is a varargs API whose parameter types depend on the command. The prototype (and documentation of how F_GETFL/F_SETFL are used) is required to show whether any pointer is passed to fcntl in these uses (and thus whether a const qualification could be applied).\n\n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK (macros): needed to know which fcntl commands and argument forms are invoked. For F_GETFL/F_SETFL the third argument is an integer (not a pointer) in typical POSIX usage; verifying these macros and their documented semantics proves no pointer is expected/used here.\n\n- ioctlsocket (function prototype): this shows the exact parameter types for the Winsock path. ioctlsocket takes a pointer (u_long *) for the FIONBIO case; the prototype/documentation is needed to determine whether that pointer is used for output (i.e., must be non-const) or could be const-qualified.\n\n- FIONBIO (macro): identifies the particular ioctlsocket command in use; combined with ioctlsocket prototype/doc tells whether the argument is an in/out pointer.\n\n- u_long / unsigned long (type definition): to match the type expected by ioctlsocket (u_long *) and to check whether the local variable type (unsigned long flags) matches the expected non-const pointer type. This confirms whether the &flags argument is compatible and whether it can be const-qualified.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine all pointer usages in make_blocking, whether any pointer parameters could be declared to point to const-qualified types, and whether the external APIs actually require non-const pointers (thus showing whether the code violates the MISRA rule)."
