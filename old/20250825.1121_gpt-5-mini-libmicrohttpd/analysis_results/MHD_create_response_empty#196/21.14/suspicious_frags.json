  "explanation": "No use of the standard library function memcmp (directly or via macros) is present in the provided code fragments. The function MHD_create_response_empty and the related macros only call calloc, free and pthread_mutex_init (via MHD_calloc_ and MHD_mutex_init_), and perform integer/pointer assignments and checks; there are no string operations or comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no candidates that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the supplied code. If additional source files or macros that expand to memcmp exist elsewhere, they must be provided to allow further inspection."
