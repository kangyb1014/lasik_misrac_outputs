  "explanation": "The only language-compiler extension present is the use of the GCC attribute syntax (__attribute__((visibility(\"default\")))) in the _MHD_EXTERN macro definition; this is documented as a compiler extension. Other code fragments do not use compiler-specific language extensions: MHD_calloc_ expands to the standard C library calloc, the explicit cast of the calloc result is standard C (not a compiler extension), MHD_mutex_init_ expands to a call to the POSIX pthread_mutex_init function (a platform API, not a compiler language extension), and the rest are plain C constructs (structs, enums, function definition, return, if, NULL, free). Therefore those other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
