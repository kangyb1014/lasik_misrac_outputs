  "explanation": "- MHD_upgrade_action: uh_cb directly calls MHD_upgrade_action. To determine whether uh_cb is involved in a call cycle (indirect recursion) we must inspect MHD_upgrade_action's implementation and its call graph to see if it (directly or indirectly) calls back into uh_cb or into any function that eventually reaches uh_cb.\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: The static call graph shows MHD_upgrade_action calls MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_. Any callee of MHD_upgrade_action could continue the call chain that leads back to uh_cb; therefore this symbol (and its callees) must be examined for calls that could close the cycle.\n- run_usock: uh_cb launches run_usock in a new thread (pthread_create(&pt, NULL, &run_usock, ws)). The provided call graph also shows run_usock as a caller of MHD_upgrade_action, so run_usock could participate in a cycle that returns to uh_cb (for example via MHD_upgrade_action \u2192 ... \u2192 run_usock \u2192 ... \u2192 uh_cb). To detect indirect recursion involving threads, run_usock and its callees must be analyzed."
