  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The lines like (void) cls; are an explicit, conventional way to \u201cuse\u201d an otherwise-unused parameter to suppress compiler diagnostics. Although they produce no runtime effect, they are purposeful: they affect the program\u2019s diagnostic/build behaviour (they prevent unused\u2011parameter warnings) and document intent. MISRA\u2019s prohibition on dead code targets operations that are executed but truly have no purpose and could be removed without any effect on the program (including its intended diagnostics/contract). Casting a parameter to void is a recognised technique to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and is not treated as dead code in practice, so the reported Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
