Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For assessing MISRA C \"well-formed for loop\" requirements you must know exactly which objects appear in the three clauses and whether any of those objects (or any objects used by called code) have side effects or are modified inside the loop body. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS\n  - The second clause of the for is \"i < MAX_CLIENTS\". You must confirm MAX_CLIENTS is an immutable compile-time constant (or at least not modified by any code reachable from the loop body) and that its definition does not expand to an expression with side effects. If MAX_CLIENTS were modifiable or a macro with side effects this could violate clause 2.\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS (declaration/definition)\n  - The loop body writes to CLIENT_SOCKS[i]. You must inspect CLIENT_SOCKS to determine whether it is a plain array/object or a macro/function-like construct (which could introduce side effects or hidden function calls). Also verify its storage class (volatile, shared, etc.) or aliasing properties that might make its use in the loop body affect the legitimacy of the second/third clause.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET\n  - Used in the conditional test inside the loop body (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET == CLIENT_SOCKS[i]). Its definition must be checked to ensure it is a simple constant and not a macro with side effects (which would affect the determination of whether the loop body has additional observable behaviour affecting the clauses).\n\n- MHD_NO\n  - Assigned to sock_overflow inside the loop body. Confirm MHD_NO is a simple constant (no side effects) and that the assignment does not implicitly trigger other behaviour. This helps ensure there are no unexpected modifications to objects referenced in the loop clauses.\n\n- struct WsData (definition, incl. member 'sock')\n  - The loop body stores ws->sock into CLIENT_SOCKS[i]. You need the WsData definition to know the type/representation of ws->sock and to check for possible aliasing or side effects (e.g., if sock is a macro or accessor that invokes code). Also ensures ws->sock is not the loop counter or otherwise linked to loop-control semantics.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef)\n  - The type of CLIENT_SOCKS elements and ws->sock. Knowing the underlying type ensures assignments are simple value stores and not function-like constructs or volatile special objects that could be treated as having side effects relevant to clause 2/3.\n\nNotes: you should also inspect any macro expansions for the above symbols (especially CLIENT_SOCKS, MAX_CLIENTS, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET, MHD_NO) to ensure none expands into expressions with hidden function calls or side effects. There are no function calls inside the for body in the shown code, but if any of the above symbols are macros that expand to function calls, those would need to be examined as part of the loop-body behaviour per the MISRA requirement."
