  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if uh_cb modifies any of its parameters (MISRA: a function parameter shall not be modified).\n\n- struct WsData: Needed to see the type and layout of ws->sock (the assignment ws->sock = sock). Confirms that this write targets ws storage, not an alias of a parameter, and that no hidden side-effect modifies the parameter variable.\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS: Declaration/type of the global array written to (CLIENT_SOCKS[i] = ws->sock). Required to confirm this write does not alias or otherwise modify any parameter variable.\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS: Loop bound constant used with CLIENT_SOCKS. Needed to ensure the loop cannot write out-of-bounds into storage that might overlap parameter storage (aliasing/overflow concerns).\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: Value used to detect free slot in CLIENT_SOCKS. Required to understand the control flow that leads to writes into CLIENT_SOCKS (and thus to reason about possible aliasing or unintended writes affecting parameters).\n\n- MUTEX: The mutex object used with pthread_mutex_lock/unlock. Needed to ensure the lock/unlock macros/functions are not implemented in a way that could modify parameter variables (e.g. via macro expansion that rebinds identifiers), and to reason about concurrency/aliasing around CLIENT_SOCKS updates.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: The symbol called when sock_overflow is true. Crucial to inspect its definition or macro expansion: if it is a macro it could expand into code that assigns to its argument (e.g. 'urh = ...'), which would directly modify the parameter variable urh in uh_cb and thus violate MISRA. Even if a function, check prototype semantics.\n\n- MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE: The constant passed to MHD_upgrade_action. Needed to inspect any macro/function overloading or macro expansions of MHD_upgrade_action that depend on this value and might cause different expansions that could modify parameters.\n\n- MHD_socket: Typedef of the socket parameter 'sock' and of ws->sock. Needed to verify types are non-aliased scalar types (so assignment copies value only) and to rule out exotic definitions (e.g. macro that expands to an lvalue that could alias a parameter).\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: Definition of the urh type. Required to determine whether passing urh into MHD_upgrade_action could have side effects on the urh parameter variable (e.g. if MHD_upgrade_action is a macro that does assignments involving the type or name), and to confirm no aliasing between urh and other storage.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: The macros/values used to set sock_overflow. Included to ensure these are simple constants (no side-effecting macros) so assignment sock_overflow = MHD_NO cannot modify parameters.\n\n- run_usock: Prototype/definition of the thread function passed to pthread_create. Included to confirm that passing ws to the new thread does not cause any macro expansions or code in the current function that would modify parameters, and to check that run_usock is not a macro that could alter caller parameter variables via expansion.\n\nIn summary, the primary risk for violating the MISRA rule in uh_cb would be any macro-like symbol (especially MHD_upgrade_action) that expands to code assigning to an identifier passed as an argument (e.g. urh), or any unexpected aliasing/overflow that makes writes in uh_cb target parameter storage. The listed symbols are those necessary to inspect to rule out those possibilities."
