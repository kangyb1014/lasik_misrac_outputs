  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" you must know the exact types and usage of pointers passed, stored or forwarded by uh_cb. Brief rationale for each symbol:\n\n- struct WsData: The function allocates and passes a struct WsData * (ws) to a worker thread and stores members (sock, urh). You must see its definition to determine which members are pointers and whether they should be const-qualified.\n\n- run_usock: The worker function is started with pthread_create(&pt, NULL, &run_usock, ws). You must examine run_usock's prototype/definition to know whether it mutates the object pointed to by ws or could accept a pointer-to-const; pthread_create requires a void * argument but run_usock's actual signature and use determine whether ws (and its pointed members) should be const.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: uh_cb receives urh and forwards it to MHD_upgrade_action and stores it in the WsData. Knowing the structure/type lets you decide if urh should be const-qualified.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: You must see its prototype to know whether it takes a pointer to const or non-const MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (i.e., whether passing urh as non-const is required or could be const).\n\n- MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE: Include the action constant so the analyzer can confirm how MHD_upgrade_action is intended to be used (and whether that API mutates urh).\n\n- MHD socket type (typedef MHD_socket): CLIENT_SOCKS and ws->sock are of this type. You need the typedef to know if it is a pointer type (and thus subject to const qualification) or an integer-like type (not applicable for const-pointer rule).\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: uh_cb receives a pointer to struct MHD_Connection (con) but does not use it. To decide if con could be const, you need the connection type and the API signature requirements.\n\n- upgrade-callback function type / prototype used to register uh_cb (libmicrohttpd API signature): The callback signature required by the library may mandate non-const parameters (so the function cannot change parameter constness). You must compare uh_cb's parameters against the official callback prototype to know whether parameters could be declared const.\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS: The global array is written here (CLIENT_SOCKS[i] = ws->sock). You need its declaration/type to determine if its element type is a pointer type that should be const or a non-pointer type (so unaffected by the rule).\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS: Size/usage of CLIENT_SOCKS array; needed to understand the array element type and indexing but mainly included so the analyzer can locate the CLIENT_SOCKS declaration in context.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: Its type/value helps classify MHD_socket and whether comparisons/assignments involve pointer types.\n\n- MUTEX (declaration/type): The code takes &MUTEX and passes it to pthread_mutex_lock/unlock. Knowing the type (likely pthread_mutex_t) is useful to confirm that &MUTEX is not a pointer-to-data that could be const-qualified in this context.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions/prototypes/macros) allows the next analyzer to determine where pointers exist, whether they are actually pointer types (versus integer handles), whether API contracts require mutable pointers, and therefore whether any pointer parameters or variables in uh_cb could or should be const-qualified per MISRA C."
