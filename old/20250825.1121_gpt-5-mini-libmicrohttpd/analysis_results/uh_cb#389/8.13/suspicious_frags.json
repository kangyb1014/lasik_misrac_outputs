  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the code were reviewed and do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either already use const where appropriate or the pointed-to object is intentionally modified (so const qualification would be incorrect):\n\n- extra_in is already declared as const char *.\n- The local buffer 'unsigned char buf[2048]' is written by recv(), so the buffer pointer cannot be const.\n- 'struct WsData *ws' is used to store and later modify socket/state and is freed; its pointee is mutated, so const would be inappropriate.\n- 'text' and 'msg' are allocated and written to (text via snprintf; msg is freed and its contents are consumed), so those pointers cannot be const-qualified.\n- The MHD_upgrade_action implementation clearly inspects and transitions connection/urh state (reads/writes fields such as urh->was_closed and performs shutdown/marking), therefore its urh parameter and callers that forward urh must use a non-const pointer.\n- CLIENT_SOCKS is an array of socket values (not pointer-to-object types) and so is not relevant to this rule.\n\nThe fragments reported above are the places where pointer parameters or stored pointer members appear not to be const-qualified in contexts where const qualification may be possible (or at least warrant verification). Other pointer occurrences were excluded for the reasons stated."
