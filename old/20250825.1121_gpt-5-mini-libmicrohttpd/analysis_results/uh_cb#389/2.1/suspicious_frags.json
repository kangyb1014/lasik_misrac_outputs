  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are potential sources of unreachable-code issues or need inspection for reachability: explicit abort() calls (noreturn), early returns, unconditional breaks from loops, and conditional compilation regions (#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT) that can render code not compiled/inaccessible in some builds. Also included are sections where control flows out of loops via break/return after resource allocation (malloc/free) and the branch handling of frame types (text vs close) where other opcode paths may leave resources unhandled \u2014 these warrant review for possible unreachable or effectively-unreachable sequences.\n\nOther code fragments were not selected because they are straightforward, obviously reachable statements or simple variable initializations and (void) casts used to silence unused-parameter warnings; simple assignments (e.g., ws->sock = sock; ws->urh = urh; memset (ws, 0, ...); CLIENT_SOCKS[i] = ws->sock;) and the switch/case structure in MHD_upgrade_action are ordinary control constructs whose reachable/non-reachable status depends on the fragments already listed. The for-loops themselves are standard iterations and were only included where a break/return (which affects reachability) occurs. Comments and function signatures are not relevant to reachability and were therefore not included."
