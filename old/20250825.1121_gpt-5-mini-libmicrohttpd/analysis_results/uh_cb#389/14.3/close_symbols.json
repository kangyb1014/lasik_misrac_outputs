  "explanation": "Each listed symbol affects a controlling expression in uh_cb or provides the constant semantics needed to decide whether those expressions can be invariant: \n\n- malloc: The if (NULL == ws) controlling expression depends on whether malloc can return NULL here. Knowledge of malloc semantics/override is required to judge invariance.\n\n- NULL: The null constant representation and any project-specific redefinition/macros affect evaluation of (NULL == ws).\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock: The if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock(&MUTEX)) test depends on the return behavior of pthread_mutex_lock (0 on success, non\u2011zero on error). If its return value is effectively constant in this build, the expression could be invariant.\n\n- MUTEX: The mutex instance passed to pthread_mutex_lock can influence whether the lock call always succeeds/fails (e.g., if it is an alias to a special object or if locks are stubbed out). Its definition/initialization is therefore needed.\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS: The for loop controlling expression i < MAX_CLIENTS depends on the numeric value and type of MAX_CLIENTS (including if it can be zero or a compile-time constant that makes the loop empty/invariant).\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS: The loop body tests CLIENT_SOCKS[i] against MHD_INVALID_SOCKET; the array\u2019s type, linkage, and initialization determine whether that comparison can be invariant for all i (making the loop behave invariantly).\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: The constant used in the comparison with CLIENT_SOCKS[i]; its value and type (and any project redefinition) affect whether the equality test is invariant.\n\n- MHD_YES / MHD_NO: These macros/defines are used to initialize and change sock_overflow and later tested by if (sock_overflow). Their exact values (non\u2011zero/zero) and semantics are needed to decide if that controlling expression is invariant.\n\n- pthread_create: The if (0 != pthread_create(...)) test depends on pthread_create\u2019s return semantics; if it is effectively constant (stubbed or platform specific) the controlling expression could be invariant.\n\n(Other functions called or types used in the body \u2014 memset, free, abort, pthread_detach, MHD_upgrade_action, run_usock, struct WsData, etc. \u2014 do not themselves form controlling expressions whose invariance needs evaluation, so they are omitted.)"
