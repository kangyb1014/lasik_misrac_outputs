  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no occurrences of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragments. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or built-ins such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, __asm__, __declspec, or GNU nested functions are used.\n- All type usage (pthread_t, pthread_mutex_t, ssize_t, MHD_socket) and macros (PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET, MHD_YES/MHD_NO) are from POSIX or the project library API, not language extensions.\n- Variadic function declaration (ellipsis in MHD_upgrade_action) and use of standard library functions (snprintf, malloc, free, memset, recv, shutdown) are standard C/POSIX features, not compiler extensions.\n- Pointer conversions between void* and object pointers, function pointer usage with pthread_create, and the static/extern declarations are standard C.\n\nBecause Rule 1.2 requires reporting only explicit compiler-documented language extensions, and none are present in the shown code, there are no suspicious fragments to report. If you want, I can re-scan for potential portability issues (e.g. reliance on POSIX types/APIs or use of snprintf(NULL, 0, ...) on platforms that may not support that idiom), but those are library/behavior concerns rather than compiler language extensions."
