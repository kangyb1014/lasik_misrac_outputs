  "explanation": "- struct WsData: The memset call uses sizeof(struct WsData) and malloc allocates sizeof(struct WsData). To determine whether memset(ws, 0, sizeof(struct WsData)) writes only inside the allocated object, the full definition of struct WsData is required (including any flexible-array members, embedded arrays, or macros that affect its size). If WsData contains a flexible array or fields that imply a required larger allocation, the current allocation/memset could be too small or incomplete.\n\n- malloc (declaration / semantics): To confirm that ws is allocated with exactly sizeof(struct WsData) bytes and that malloc returns a pointer suitable for memset of that size, the allocator semantics are relevant (standard prototype and behavior). This also documents that ws is not NULL (the code checks for NULL, but the allocation size and pointer type must match the object being zeroed).\n\n- memset (declaration from <string.h>): The MISRA rule targets string.h functions; the specific behavior and parameter types of memset (pointer, int, size_t) must be known to reason about whether the third argument (sizeof(struct WsData)) could cause out-of-bounds writes given the pointer returned by malloc.\n\n- free (declaration / semantics): Although free is not directly a string function, it is used on ws when socket overflow occurs. Knowing free semantics helps verify that the code does not use ws after free in this function and that no stray writes via memset/free interplay cause UB. (It also documents that ws lifetime is controlled locally in this branch.)\n\n- run_usock (function prototype): ws is passed to a newly created thread which may assume ws has additional trailing storage or different layout. To be sure the allocation and memset performed in uh_cb are correct for the object as used by the worker, the worker\u2019s prototype/expectation of the WsData object must be known (e.g., if run_usock expects a larger buffer or performs writes beyond sizeof(struct WsData), that would be relevant to overall safety even if not a direct string.h misuse in uh_cb)."
