  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I inspected the provided uh_cb function and the related code fragments (run_usock, MHD_upgrade_action, MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_, struct WsData). There is no use of the standard library function memcmp anywhere in the supplied code. The string/byte operations present are memset (initialization), recv, snprintf (formatting), and free/malloc; none of these represent memcmp-based comparisons of null-terminated strings. Comparisons present (e.g. CLIENT_SOCKS[i] == ws->sock, checks for NULL, integer/enum comparisons) do not use memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation for Rule 21.14. Note: functions called but not defined here (ws_receive_frame, ws_send_frame, and other MHD_* helpers) are outside the supplied code and could potentially use memcmp internally; those functions should be checked separately if their sources are available. Otherwise, within the supplied codebase fragments, no memcmp usage comparing null-terminated strings was found."
