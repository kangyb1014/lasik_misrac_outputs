  "explanation": "run_usock: uh_cb spawns a new thread that runs run_usock(ws). Any use of memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings inside run_usock (or its transitive callees) would make the overall behaviour attributable to uh_cb; the analyser must inspect run_usock source.\n\nMHD_upgrade_action: uh_cb calls this function directly when rejecting a socket. MHD_upgrade_action itself (or functions it calls) might use memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings, so its implementation must be examined.\n\nMHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: This symbol is called by MHD_upgrade_action (per the call graph). If memcmp is used here on null\u2011terminated strings, that usage is reachable from uh_cb via MHD_upgrade_action and must be checked.\n\nmemcmp: The MISRA rule is specifically about use of the Standard Library memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings. The analyser must check all occurrences/usages of memcmp in the code reachable from uh_cb (directly or transitively) to determine whether any compare operations are applied to C strings.\n\nstruct WsData: uh_cb allocates and passes a pointer to a WsData instance to the worker thread (run_usock). The structure definition is needed to see which fields are strings or byte buffers and how they are used by run_usock or other callees (to determine whether memcmp might be comparing null\u2011terminated strings).\n\nstruct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: uh_cb passes urh to MHD_upgrade_action and stores it in WsData. Its definition and related accessors are needed to determine whether any string data reachable through this handle is compared with memcmp in MHD_* code paths.\n\nNote: To fully determine compliance, the analyser should also fetch the source (or prototypes) of any other transitive callees of run_usock, MHD_upgrade_action and MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ (i.e., any function they call) so that all uses of memcmp reachable from uh_cb are examined."
