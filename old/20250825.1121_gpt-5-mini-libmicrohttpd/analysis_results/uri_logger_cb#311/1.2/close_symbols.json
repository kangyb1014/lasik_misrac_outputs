    "malloc (declaration typically in <stdlib.h>)",
    "gettimeofday (declaration typically in <sys/time.h>, POSIX)",
    "struct timeval (definition typically in <sys/time.h>)",

  ],
  "explanation": "You must inspect these symbols to decide whether the function uses any compiler language extensions (the MISRA rule). Reasons:\n\n- malloc: The call to malloc could be relying on an implicit function declaration (historic K&R behavior) or on a macro/wrapper that embeds compiler-specific attributes or extensions. To determine whether any nonstandard/extension behavior is used you need the actual malloc declaration/definition visible in the translation unit (normally from <stdlib.h>).\n\n- gettimeofday: This is a library (POSIX) function, not a core C language construct. Confirming its declaration is necessary to detect whether the code relies on implicit declarations (a language-extension behavior in some compilers or language modes) or on a compiler-specific variant/attribute. Also some platforms may provide gettimeofday as an extension; knowing its declaration lets you judge if a compiler-specific form is being used.\n\n- struct timeval: sizeof(struct timeval) requires the type to be complete. You need the actual struct timeval definition to confirm the code is valid and to ensure no compiler-specific or nonstandard definition (e.g., implemented via an extension) is being used.\n\n- struct timezone: present in the gettimeofday prototype; including it ensures you can fully examine the gettimeofday declaration and decide whether any platform-specific/extension usage appears in the prototype.\n\n- NULL: The code uses NULL; its definition (macro) can vary across platforms and could be implemented in a way that relies on compiler extensions. Inspecting the macro definition ensures NULL is the standard macro and not a compiler-specific extension.\n\nIn short: these symbols cover the external declarations/macros/types the function depends on. Inspecting them lets you detect implicit declarations or nonstandard/extension definitions (the only cases that would violate the MISRA prohibition on language extensions)."
