  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide whether uri_logger_cb contains dead code:\n\n- malloc\n  - The function allocates memory and returns the pointer. Determining whether the malloc call (and the allocation it performs) is dead requires knowing malloc semantics and whether callers use / rely on the allocated memory or its side effects on the heap state. If the allocation is observed (used/freed), removal would change behaviour; if not observed, it may be dead.\n\n- gettimeofday\n  - gettimeofday reads the system clock and writes into the allocated buffer. It has observable side effects (time observation and writes to *tv). Because MISRA notes timing can affect behaviour, removal of this call could change timed behaviour even if the returned pointer is unused. You must know whether gettimeofday has observable effects in the project context.\n\n- struct timeval\n  - sizeof(struct timeval) is used for allocation and gettimeofday writes into this object. The type definition (size/layout) is needed to confirm the allocation size is correct and to reason about how gettimeofday populates fields that callers might read (thus determining if the write is observable).\n\n- NULL\n  - The NULL check governs whether gettimeofday is called. Understanding the precise NULL definition (and any project redefinitions) is required to reason about the condition and whether gettimeofday can run.\n\n- free (and any deallocator of the returned pointer)\n  - To determine whether the allocation has an effect beyond the function, you must know whether any caller eventually frees or otherwise observes the allocated object. If callers free or inspect the object, the allocation is not dead; if nothing ever frees or inspects it, the allocation and possibly gettimeofday call could be dead.\n\n- All direct callers of uri_logger_cb (each caller function name and the exact call sites)\n  - The fundamental question for \"dead code\" is whether the function (and its internal operations) influence program behaviour. If there are no callers, or all callers ignore the return value and the timing side-effect is irrelevant, the function (or parts of it) may be dead. Analyzing each caller and how it uses the returned pointer (or whether it ignores the call entirely) is essential.\n\n- Any functions that dereference or otherwise use the returned struct timeval (field accesses, printing, comparisons)\n  - Even if a caller exists, it may or may not use the timeval contents. Any downstream uses that read fields produced by gettimeofday make the gettimeofday write observable (so not dead). Include those symbols to trace observability.\n\n- Project-provided replacement for malloc (custom allocator, if any)\n  - Some projects override malloc with wrappers that have additional observable behaviour (logging, interrupts, side effects). If such overrides exist, the call cannot be assumed innocuous; you must inspect the replacement symbol to decide whether the call is dead.\n\n- C language semantics of the void-cast expression statements ((void)cls; (void)uri;)\n  - The (void)expr; statements are executed but are no-ops when expr has no side effects. Determining whether they constitute dead code requires knowing the language semantics: these discard values and have no side effects (unless expr has side effects). Including this symbol (the semantic rule) lets the analyzer conclude these statements are dead/no-op if cls and uri have no side effects.\n\nNote: The static call graph should provide the list of direct callers and their use-sites\u2014include those function symbols and any downstream consumers/freers of the returned pointer when preparing the next analysis prompt."
