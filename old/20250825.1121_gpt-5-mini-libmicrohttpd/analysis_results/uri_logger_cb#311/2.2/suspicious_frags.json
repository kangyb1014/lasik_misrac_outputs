  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs should NOT be investigated for Rule 2.2 (dead code):\n- \"struct timeval *tv = malloc (sizeof (struct timeval));\" allocates memory; removing it would change program behaviour (no allocation, different return and side-effects), so it is not dead.\n- \"if (NULL != tv)\\n    gettimeofday (tv, NULL);\" invokes gettimeofday only when allocation succeeded; gettimeofday has side effects (fills the buffer) so its execution affects behaviour and is not dead.\n- \"return tv;\" returns the allocated pointer; removing the return would change observable behaviour.\n- The function signature and the static function itself cannot be assumed unused from this fragment alone; a static function that is never called is unreachable (note 2) not dead, so it should not be flagged here without whole-project analysis.\n- The comment lines and the struct/timeval type usage are non-executable or necessary declarations and are not dead code.\nNo other executed operations in this function are no-op operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour."
