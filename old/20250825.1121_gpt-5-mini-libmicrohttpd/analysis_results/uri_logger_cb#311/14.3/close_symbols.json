  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression if (NULL != tv) is invariant you must know whether tv can ever be NULL at runtime. That depends on: (1) malloc: whether the allocation function can return NULL in this build (standard malloc can fail and return NULL, but some projects replace malloc with wrappers that never return NULL or annotate it as returns_nonnull). You need the actual function symbol, its prototype, and any attributes/wrappers/replacements to determine if the call can ever produce NULL. (2) NULL: how NULL is defined in this translation unit (e.g. ((void*)0) vs 0) to ensure the pointer comparison is a genuine runtime pointer test and not folded by some unusual macro. (3) struct timeval: sizeof(struct timeval) is the size passed to malloc; if that sizeof could be zero (implementation/extension), malloc(0) has implementation-defined behavior (may return NULL or non-NULL), which affects whether the condition can vary. With these symbols you can determine if (NULL != tv) can be true or false at runtime (and thus whether the controlling expression is invariant)."
