The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",
  "close_symbols": [],
  "explanation": "No additional external symbols are required. The MISRA rule in question concerns the syntactic and semantic well-formedness of for statements that appear in the target function. The body of uri_logger_cb contains no for loop, so there is nothing in this function that can violate the rule. Therefore inspecting only the target function source is sufficient to determine compliance.\n\nNotes (for completeness):\n- Some might argue that functions called from inside a for loop must also be inspected because \"the behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\" That is only relevant if uri_logger_cb itself contained a for statement that called other functions. It does not, so the implementations or declarations of malloc, gettimeofday, struct timeval or NULL (stdlib/sys/time headers) do not affect whether uri_logger_cb violates the MISRA for-loop rule.\n\nIf you still want to expand the analysis to called functions (not required here), the relevant symbols would be: malloc, gettimeofday, and the definition of struct timeval. These would be needed only to inspect their bodies for for-loops in case uri_logger_cb contained a for-loop invoking them; they are not required to assess the present function."
