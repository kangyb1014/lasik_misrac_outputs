  "scenario": "The parameter 'cls' is declared as 'void *cls' but is unused and not modified in the function; it could be declared as 'const void *cls'. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointed-to type should be const-qualified whenever possible, so this declaration violates the rule (unless a non-const API requirement prevents making it const)."
