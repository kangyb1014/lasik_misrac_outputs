  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment only casts the unused parameter to void to suppress a compiler warning; it does not dereference or use the pointer. Rule 8.13 would be violated if a function accepted a pointer to data that it does not modify but declared it without const (for example: static void *f(void *p) where p is only read \u2014 it should be const void *p). In the presented fragment there is no evidence that cls should be const, so the rule is not violated."
