  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they already satisfy the const-qualification requirement or cannot reasonably be made const. Specifically: the parameter const char *uri is already const-qualified; the (void) uri; statement is only suppressing an unused-parameter warning and does not affect qualification; the local object referenced by tv (struct timeval *tv) is passed to gettimeofday which modifies the pointed-to object, so it cannot be const-qualified; the malloc(sizeof(struct timeval)) usage and the NULL check are standard and do not indicate a missed opportunity to use const. Therefore only the listed fragments (the function return type, the non-const cls parameter and its suppression, and the non-const return) warrant further investigation for possible use of const qualification."
