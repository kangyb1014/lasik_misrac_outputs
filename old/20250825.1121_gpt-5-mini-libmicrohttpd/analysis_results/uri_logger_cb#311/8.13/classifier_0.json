  "scenario": "Not violated in this fragment. The return type 'void *' by itself does not breach Rule 8.13 \u2014 whether a pointer should be const-qualified depends on the object\u2019s intent. In the full function, a freshly malloc'd struct timeval (mutable) is returned, so a non-const pointer is appropriate. A concrete violation scenario would be: if the function actually returned a pointer to read\u2011only data (for example a pointer to a string literal or to a statically allocated const struct timeval) but was declared to return 'void *' instead of 'const void *' (or 'const struct timeval *'), then Rule 8.13 would be violated."
