  "explanation": "malloc: Verify its prototype/definition (normally from <stdlib.h>) to confirm it does not take or modify any of the function parameters (and to understand its return semantics so tv can be NULL). gettimeofday: Verify its prototype/definition (normally from <sys/time.h>) to ensure it does not accept or modify uri or cls (it only writes to the local tv pointer) and to exclude the possibility that it is a macro that might reference outer symbols. struct timeval: The type definition is needed to confirm that tv is an object distinct from the parameters (so calls that write into tv cannot be considered modifications of function parameters). NULL: Check the definition of NULL (macro/constant) used in the comparison to ensure it has the expected semantics. These symbols are the external items referenced by the function; confirming their declarations/definitions is necessary to prove that no called routine or macro could be modifying the function parameters (cls, uri) and thus violating the MISRA rule."
