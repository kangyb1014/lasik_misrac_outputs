  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The statements (void) cls; and (void) uri; are solely used to suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not assign to or otherwise modify the parameters. There are no assignments to cls or uri, nor are they passed to functions that would modify the pointer themselves. The only pointer that is allocated and modified is the local variable tv (malloc, then gettimeofday writes to *tv), which is not a function parameter. Therefore, no code fragments need investigation for potential violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
