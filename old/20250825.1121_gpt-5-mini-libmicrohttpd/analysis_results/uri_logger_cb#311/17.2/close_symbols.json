  "explanation": "MISRA rule: \"Functions shall not call themselves, either directly or indirectly.\" To determine whether uri_logger_cb violates this rule you must inspect every function it calls to see if any path returns to uri_logger_cb. The symbols listed are required for that analysis:\n\n- malloc: uri_logger_cb calls malloc. You must examine malloc's implementation and its call-graph to determine whether malloc (directly or indirectly) can call back into uri_logger_cb. Many malloc implementations may call other allocator routines or user hooks that could invoke application callbacks.\n\n- gettimeofday: uri_logger_cb calls gettimeofday. You must inspect gettimeofday's implementation and its call-graph for any possible indirect path back to uri_logger_cb (for example, via user-provided time hooks or signal handlers that might call application code).\n\n- __malloc_hook (or any malloc wrapper/hook used in the build, e.g. malloc_hook, __wrap_malloc, malloc@GLIBC_*): Allocators are frequently overridden or instrumented. If the build uses wrappers or hooks, those symbols are potential callees of code that may call application functions. Include the actual hook/wrapper symbols present in your build so their call-graphs can be analyzed.\n\n- Any functions called (directly or indirectly) by malloc and gettimeofday (i.e. the full call-graph rooted at malloc and gettimeofday): The recursion check requires the full transitive closure of calls starting from the functions invoked by uri_logger_cb. List and analyze every function reachable from malloc and gettimeofday to see if any path reaches uri_logger_cb.\n\nNote: No other symbols in uri_logger_cb (struct timeval, unused parameters cls/uri) can create call edges, so they are not required for recursion analysis. The primary effort is to resolve the actual implementations/wrappers/hooks for malloc and gettimeofday and their transitive callees."
