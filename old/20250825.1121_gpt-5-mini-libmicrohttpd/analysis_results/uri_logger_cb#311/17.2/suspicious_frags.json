  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function uri_logger_cb does not call itself directly. It only calls malloc and gettimeofday, which are standard library functions and will not indirectly call back into user-defined functions in this translation unit. There are no function-pointer invocations, no callbacks passed in via cls or uri (both are unused), and no other local or static functions are invoked that could form an indirect recursion chain. Therefore there is no evidence of direct or indirect self-calls requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
