  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the provided function. Every statement can be executed in some runtime scenario: the malloc call and the (void) casts for cls and uri are always executed when the function is entered; the gettimeofday call is executed when malloc succeeds (tv != NULL) and is skipped when malloc fails \u2014 this is a reachable alternative path, not unreachable code; the return tv; statement is the function exit and there are no statements following it that would be unreachable. Thus there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in this snippet."
