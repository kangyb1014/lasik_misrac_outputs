  "explanation": "To determine whether any part of uri_logger_cb is statically unreachable you must know the behavior and declarations of the external symbols that affect control flow and the condition in the function:\n\n- malloc (or its project-specific wrapper/macro): The if (NULL != tv) branch and the subsequent return depend on the value returned by malloc. If the project replaces malloc with a wrapper that never returns (e.g., aborts on failure) or guaranteed-to-return-non-NULL allocation routine, the conditional becomes constant and either the code after malloc or one branch of the if may be unreachable. Therefore the exact implementation/signature and any attributes (for example, noreturn) or #define replacements are required.\n\n- gettimeofday: If gettimeofday is declared or defined with attributes that affect control flow (for example, marked noreturn in this build or replaced by a macro that does not return), then the code after that call (the return statement in the path where tv != NULL) could be unreachable. The prototype/attributes are needed to decide reachability.\n\n- struct timeval (definition): sizeof(struct timeval) is used as the malloc size. If struct timeval were an incomplete type or had sizeof == 0 in the translation unit (or if the project relies on unusual platform definitions), malloc(0) semantics may lead to implementation-defined returns (NULL or non-NULL), changing the truth value of the if and therefore reachability. Knowing the actual definition and resulting sizeof is necessary.\n\n- NULL (macro/definition): The code compares tv to NULL. Although rarely an issue, a project could redefine NULL in a way that affects the comparison semantics in a non-standard build; the exact definition ensures the condition is evaluated as intended and helps rule out a constant-folded compare that would make code unreachable.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their declarations, attributes, and any project-specific replacements) lets an analyzer decide whether any branch or statement in uri_logger_cb is provably unreachable for the MISRA C rule check."
