  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code. The function contains: (1) a malloc of a struct timeval, (2) two (void) casts to mark cls and uri as unused, (3) a gettimeofday call, and (4) return of tv. There are no string operations or comparisons (no memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or similar) and no usage of the uri pointer other than casting it to void. Therefore there are no code fragments that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings)."
