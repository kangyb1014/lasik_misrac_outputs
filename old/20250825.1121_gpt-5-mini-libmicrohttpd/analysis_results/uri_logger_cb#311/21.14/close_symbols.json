  "explanation": "malloc \u2014 The target function calls malloc; to prove the function does not (directly or indirectly) use memcmp on null-terminated strings the analyzer must inspect the implementation or model of malloc to ensure it does not call memcmp on any char* string. gettimeofday \u2014 The target function calls gettimeofday; the same reasoning applies: the analyzer must inspect gettimeofday (or its model) to ensure it does not call memcmp on null-terminated strings. memcmp \u2014 This is the specific Standard Library function restricted by the MISRA rule; the analyzer needs the memcmp symbol/signature to detect any direct uses in the target function or any callees and to recognize calls or aliases to it. struct timeval \u2014 The function allocates and returns a struct timeval pointer; the definition is needed to parse/understand the allocation size and to fully type-check the function when building a call/alias model (helps ensure no hidden string comparisons are performed on members). NULL \u2014 The macro appears in the code (NULL != tv) and is part of parsing/semantic analysis; including it ensures the analyzer can correctly interpret null-pointer checks and any comparisons that might involve pointer-to-char values."
