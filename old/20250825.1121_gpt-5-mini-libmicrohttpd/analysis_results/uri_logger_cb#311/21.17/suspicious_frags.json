  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> string-handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in the fragment. The code only calls malloc and gettimeofday and casts unused parameters to void; none of these involve copying or scanning string buffers or performing pointer arithmetic on string objects that could produce out-of-bounds accesses covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The allocation uses sizeof(struct timeval), which matches the object returned; returning the allocated pointer (possibly NULL) and treating uri as unused are not related to the string-handling rule. Therefore there are no fragments here that require investigation under Rule 21.17."
