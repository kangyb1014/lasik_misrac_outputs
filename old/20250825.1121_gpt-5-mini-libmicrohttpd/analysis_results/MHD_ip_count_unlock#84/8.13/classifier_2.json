  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function takes struct MHD_Daemon *daemon and passes &daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex to MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, an operation that modifies the mutex state (and thus the pointed-to object). Because the function needs to modify a member of the structure (unlock the mutex), the pointer cannot reasonably be const-qualified. The mhd_assert only reads a field, but that does not make the whole pointer eligible for const. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated."
