  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies the parameter variable 'daemon' itself. Details:\n- The expression mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master); only reads a member (daemon->master) for comparison and does not assign to the parameter variable. Even if mhd_assert is a macro, it is expected to evaluate the expression, not to reassign the parameter.\n- The call MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex); takes the address of a member and passes it to a function. Passing &daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex may allow that function to modify the pointed-to object (allowed by Rule 17.8), but it does not modify the pointer parameter variable 'daemon' itself.\n- The (void) daemon; statement merely suppresses unused-parameter warnings and does not modify the parameter.\n- There are no assignments to 'daemon' (no reassignments, no increment/decrement of the pointer variable). Therefore, no fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
