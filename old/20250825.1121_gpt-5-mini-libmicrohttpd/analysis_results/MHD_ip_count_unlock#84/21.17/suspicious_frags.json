  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in this function. The code only contains an assertion (mhd_assert), a conditional call to a mutex-unlock helper (MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex)), and a void cast to suppress unused-parameter warnings. None of these involve string handling or pointer/length-based buffer operations that could access beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
