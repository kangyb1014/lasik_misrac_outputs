  "explanation": "No other code fragments use compiler-specific language extensions. The target function and its body use only standard C constructs and standard types (size_t, uint64_t, UINT64_MAX), ordinary casts, and control flow (do/while). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_... intrinsics, typeof, statement-expressions ({: ... :}), vendor-specific pragmas, or other nonstandard keywords in the provided code. Therefore, aside from the single flagged fragment, no other parts need investigation for Rule 1.2."
