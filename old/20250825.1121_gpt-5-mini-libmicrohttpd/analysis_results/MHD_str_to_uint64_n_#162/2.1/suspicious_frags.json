  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the supplied function. Reasoning: \n\n- The initial guard (if (! str || ! maxlen || ! out_val || ! isasciidigit (str[0])) return 0;) is a deliberate early-exit for invalid inputs; it does not create unreachable code elsewhere \u2014 it simply prevents execution for invalid arguments.\n- The function uses a do { ... } while ((i < maxlen) && isasciidigit(str[i])); loop. Because the precondition requires isasciidigit(str[0]) and maxlen != 0, the loop body is reachable (executes at least once). The loop condition prevents further iterations when i reaches maxlen or a non-digit is encountered, so there are no hidden paths that make code paths unreachable.\n- All return statements are reachable under some input conditions (early return on invalid input or overflow, final return of processed length). There is no code placed after an unconditional return that would be unreachable.\n- The overflow-check branch (return 0;) and the final assignment *out_val = res; are both reachable depending on inputs; neither is dead code.\n- The helper isasciidigit function is a simple predicate and is used in reachable checks; it itself contains no unreachable statements.\n\nGiven these points, there are no code fragments in the provided code that appear to be unreachable; therefore no fragments need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
