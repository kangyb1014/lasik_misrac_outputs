  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided target function and the related isasciidigit implementation contain no calls to memcmp, no wrapper/alias of memcmp, and no other bulk memory comparison operations that could be interpreted as using memcmp. All character tests are performed via single-character comparisons (e.g. isasciidigit uses c >= '0' && c <= '9'), and the code parses digits and performs arithmetic\u2014there are no string-to-string comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need to be investigated for Rule 21.14."
