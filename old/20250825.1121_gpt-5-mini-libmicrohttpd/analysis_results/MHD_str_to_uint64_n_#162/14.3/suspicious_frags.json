  "explanation": "I identified all controlling statements in the function for Rule 14.3 review: the initial guard if, the overflow-check if, and the do-while loop condition. All other lines are simple assignments, arithmetic, increments (e.g. res = 0; i = 0; res *= 10; res += ...; i++;), the return statements, or the isasciidigit helper definition (a simple range test) \u2014 none of these are controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3. There are no other selection or iteration controlling expressions in the provided code, so no additional fragments need investigation under Rule 14.3."
