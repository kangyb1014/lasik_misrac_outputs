  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any function parameter variables. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameters are str (const char *), and out_val (uint64_t *). There is no assignment to str or out_val anywhere in the function (no pointer reassignment, no pointer arithmetic that updates the parameter). The function only indexes str (str[i]) and casts its character value; indexing and casting do not modify the pointer parameter itself.\n- The value stored via the pointer parameter is *out_val = res; this modifies the object pointed to by out_val, which is permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The pointer variable out_val itself is not changed.\n- The scalar parameter maxlen is only read (tested and compared), not assigned to or modified.\n- The helper isasciidigit(char c) takes its argument by value and does not modify the caller's parameter.\n- All other assignments update local variables (res, i, digit), not any of the function parameters.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that should be investigated for potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
