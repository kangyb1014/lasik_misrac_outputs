  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C's 'no unreachable code' rule you must know which conditions or called routines can forcibly terminate or otherwise make code after them impossible to reach, and which compile-time macros remove code paths. Briefly, why each symbol is needed:\n\n- mhd_assert: The assertion macro may expand to code that aborts, longjmps, or otherwise does not return. Its definition (no-op vs terminating) directly affects whether the following statements are potentially unreachable. You need its exact expansion/implementation to judge reachability.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: This compile-time macro controls whether the two TLS-related mhd_assert() calls are present. If HTTPS_SUPPORT is not defined those asserts are absent, affecting whether any code is conditionally unreachable. You need to know its value or how it is set.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS: Used inside the mhd_assert conditions; if MHD_USE_TLS is a compile-time constant or macro that makes the asserted expression always true/false, that can create (un)reachable code. Its definition/usage influences reachability reasoning of the asserts.\n\n- MHD_TLS_CONN_INIT and MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS: These constants are compared against c->tls_state in the asserts. If one or both are equal to other compile-time constants or have particular values that make assertions tautologies or contradictions, that affects reachability analysis.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_INIT: Compared with c->state via mhd_assert. If this value or the initialization of c->state forces the assertion to be always true/false, it can produce unreachable code paths. Need its definition.\n\n- MHD_CONN_KEEPALIVE_UNKOWN and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ: These constants are assigned to fields. While assignments themselves don't create unreachable code, their definitions may be macros with side effects or expand to constructs that affect control flow in some implementations; include them to be certain no surprise macros alter reachability.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The layout (presence and types of fields used: daemon, tls_state, state, keepalive, event_loop_info, rq, rp, write_buffer, read_buffer, pool, etc.) is needed to verify that any expressions used in asserts or assignments are well-formed and whether some fields are const/volatile or have attributes that affect control flow (e.g., volatile reads or traps). Also to know if any fields are macros or accessors that could be functions.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: The daemon sub-structure is used (options, pool_size). You need its definition to know whether options is a compile-time constant, whether pool_size is constant/zero (which could make allocation size zero and lead to platform-specific behavior), and whether accessors are plain fields or macros/function calls that could affect flow.\n\n- MHD_pool_allocate: This callee is invoked to allocate the read buffer. You must know whether it can return normally, return NULL, or be annotated as noreturn/abort/longjmp. If it never returns normally (e.g., terminates on failure or is a macro that longjmps), subsequent assignments (c->read_buffer_size = read_buf_size;) could be unreachable. Its prototype/definition and any attributes are required.\n\n(Other standard library routines used here, e.g. memset, are assumed to behave normally and do not affect reachability in typical implementations; they need no special treatment for this rule unless they are replaced by project macros.)"
