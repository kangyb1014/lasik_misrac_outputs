Other lines in the function are simple scalar initializations or enum/state assignments (e.g. keepalive, event_loop_info, various size/offset integer assignments, read_buf_size calculation, c->state assertion) that do not involve pointer types and thus are not relevant to the requirement that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
