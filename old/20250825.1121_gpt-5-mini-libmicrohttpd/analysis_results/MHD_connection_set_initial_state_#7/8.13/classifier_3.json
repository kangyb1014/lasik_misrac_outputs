  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: memset(&c->rp, 0, sizeof(c->rp)) passes the address of a non-const object to memset which intends to modify that object. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified when they can be, but here the target must be modifiable, so using a non-const pointer is correct. (A violation would occur if c->rp were const-qualified and the code cast away const to call memset.)"
