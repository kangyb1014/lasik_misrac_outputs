  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The parameter is declared as struct MHD_Connection *c and the function modifies members of *c (e.g. c->keepalive, c->event_loop_info, c->read_buffer, etc.). Because the pointed-to object is intentionally modified, declaring the pointer as pointer-to-const would be inappropriate. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated."
