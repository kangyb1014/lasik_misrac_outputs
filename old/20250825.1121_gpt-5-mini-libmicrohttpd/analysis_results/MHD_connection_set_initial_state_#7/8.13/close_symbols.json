  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Connection (full declaration)\n   - Required because the MISRA rule you are checking applies to the pointer member declarations themselves. To decide whether e.g. c->read_buffer or c->write_buffer should be const-qualified you must know the exact declared type of those members (char * vs const char *, void * vs const void *, etc.) and any other pointer members shown in the function.\n\n2) struct MHD_Daemon (full declaration)\n   - The function reads c->daemon->pool_size and uses c->daemon->options in assertions. Knowing the daemon struct is needed to confirm types (pool_size type) and to see whether daemon provides any API semantics that imply the buffer must be mutable (for example if daemon fields point into shared mutable storage).\n\n3) prototype and semantics of MHD_pool_allocate (signature and whether it returns const-qualified pointer)\n   - The target function assigns c->read_buffer from MHD_pool_allocate; to determine whether the pointer should be const-qualified you must know what type that function returns (void *, char *, const void *, etc.) and the intended mutability of the returned memory (is it writable buffer memory or a pointer into read-only storage). If MHD_pool_allocate already returns a non-const pointer (void *), that affects whether c->read_buffer can be const.\n\n4) declaration/type of the pool object (the type of c->pool, e.g. MHD_Pool)\n   - The pool type and its semantics (is it an allocator that hands out mutable buffers, or does it hand out pointers into shared/immutable memory) determine whether allocations must be mutable. This is required to assess whether the pointer can be const-qualified.\n\n5) implementation of MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (and any other functions that allocate or reassign c->read_buffer / c->write_buffer)\n   - The call graph shows other functions (e.g. MHD_connection_alloc_memory_) that also call MHD_pool_allocate or otherwise touch these members. If other code assigns, reallocates or writes into these buffers, the pointer cannot be const. You need the implementations to see whether the buffers are ever modified.\n\n6) implementations (or prototypes) of all functions that read from or write to c->read_buffer and c->write_buffer (every function that uses those members)\n   - The key MISRA determination is whether the pointed-to object is ever modified. If any function writes into the memory referenced by these pointers (via the pointer itself or passes it to APIs that write), then the pointer type must be non-const. To conclude this, you must inspect all call sites that dereference or pass those members to mutating APIs. Provide those function bodies or at least their prototypes and documentation indicating mutating behavior.\n\nNotes:\n- Integer constants and state macros used only for assertions (MHD_USE_TLS, MHD_TLS_CONN_INIT, MHD_CONNECTION_INIT, MHD_CONN_KEEPALIVE_UNKOWN, MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ) do not affect pointer const-qualification and are not required for this particular MISRA check.\n- If you cannot inspect every caller that touches c->read_buffer/c->write_buffer, the conservative MISRA-compliant decision is to keep the pointers non-const; therefore obtaining the listed symbols is necessary to make a definitive determination."
