  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: &c->rp is a pointer to the member rp within struct MHD_Connection and sizeof(c->rp) yields the compile\u2011time size of that member, so memset writes only to that member\u2019s storage. This does not access beyond the bounds of the object referenced by the pointer parameter. (A potential logic bug\u2014clearing the pointer instead of the memory it points to\u2014would not be an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access and thus not a Rule 21.17 violation.)"
