  "explanation": "Only the calls to the standard <string.h> function memset appear in this function and thus are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. All other statements do not call any of the <string.h> functions listed by the rule (no memcpy, memmove, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn are present). The allocation call MHD_pool_allocate and assignments to buffer pointers/sizes are not calls to the standard string-handling functions and therefore are outside the scope of this rule; they may still require separate review for correctness, but they do not directly trigger Rule 21.17. Additionally, uses of sizeof(...) in the memset calls should be reviewed to ensure the referenced objects (&c->rq and &c->rp) are complete and that the computed size matches the actual storage meant to be initialized, which is why the memset calls were flagged for investigation."
