This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection (complete definition): The function calls memset(&c->rq, 0, sizeof(c->rq)) and memset(&c->rp, 0, sizeof(c->rp)). To determine whether those memset calls can write beyond the bounds of the referenced objects we must know the exact declarations and sizes of the members rq and rp and the layout of the MHD_Connection object (and whether any of these are flexible-array members or pointers). The full struct is therefore required.\n\n- declaration/definition of the types of c->rq and c->rp (if they are separate typedefs/structs): If rq/rp are instances of separate struct/typedefs, their internal definitions are needed to compute sizeof(c->rq) / sizeof(c->rp) and to confirm that the pointer passed to memset references an object of at least that size (i.e. ensure there is no mismatch between the object bounds and the size argument).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (complete definition): The function computes read_buf_size = c->daemon->pool_size / 2 and then calls MHD_pool_allocate with that size. To reason about any subsequent string/memory operations (and to ensure no indirect overflow concerns within this function), we need the type and semantic units of pool_size (its type/range) and to verify c->daemon is a valid pointer type and member offset relationships.\n\n- MHD_pool_allocate (prototype and allocation semantics): The call c->read_buffer = MHD_pool_allocate(c->pool, read_buf_size, false) allocates memory used by the connection. To judge whether any future string.h operations (or code in this function that might interact with the returned buffer) could access beyond the returned object's bounds, we need the allocation semantics: does it return a pointer to at least read_buf_size bytes, what alignment/limits exist, and how failure is signalled.\n\n- memset (prototype / standard semantics from <string.h>): To apply the MISRA rule we must confirm the semantics of memset used here (that it writes exactly the specified number of bytes starting at the supplied pointer). Including the standard prototype clarifies the type of the size parameter (size_t) and the expected behavior so we can verify the argument types and values used in the calls are appropriate.\n\n(These symbols together let the next analyst compute the actual object sizes and confirm that the sizeof(...) arguments and pointers passed to memset cannot cause out-of-bounds writes.)"
