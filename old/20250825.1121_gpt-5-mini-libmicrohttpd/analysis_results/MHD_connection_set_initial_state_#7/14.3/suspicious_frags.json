  "explanation": "No controlling statements are present in the function: there are no if, switch, for, while or do-while constructs whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The only apparent conditional-style expressions are the arguments to mhd_assert, but the provided macro definition (#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)) makes these calls no-ops (they do not expand to any controlling statement). Therefore there are no places in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 and no fragments require further investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
