  "explanation": "For determining whether this function violates MISRA C rule \u201cControlling expressions shall not be invariant\u201d, the analyzer must know any symbols that could introduce or affect control expressions inside the function (including via macro expansion) or determine invariance of expressions used by those controls. Explanations:\n\n- mhd_assert: Likely a macro; may expand to conditional code (if/abort/log) whose controlling expression is the asserted expression. The exact expansion is necessary to see whether it contains an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: Preprocessor macro that governs whether the TLS-related mhd_asserts are compiled. Knowing whether this is defined changes whether those potential control expressions exist.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS: Bitmask/flag used in the assert expressions. Needed to evaluate the asserted expression and whether it is invariant.\n\n- MHD_TLS_CONN_INIT, MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS: Constants compared to c->tls_state inside the asserts. Needed to assess whether the assert controlling expressions are invariant.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_INIT: Constant compared to c->state in an assert. Needed to see if that assert (and any control it expands to) contains an invariant expression.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition: fields used): The function reads/writes many fields (daemon, tls_state, state, keepalive, event_loop_info, rq, rp, write_buffer*, continue_message_write_offset, read_buffer_offset, read_buffer, read_buffer_size, pool). To judge invariance of any expression involving these fields (e.g., in mhd_assert expansions) we must know whether these fields are modifiable or constant at that point.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition: options, pool_size): The assert accesses c->daemon->options and the function uses c->daemon->pool_size to compute read_buf_size. To determine if those values (used in control expressions) can be invariant, their definitions and mutability must be known.\n\n- MHD_CONN_KEEPALIVE_UNKOWN: Value assigned to c->keepalive; included to determine whether any macro or assignment could hide control expressions (and to understand whether any of these values are compile-time constants relevant to invariance analysis).\n\n- MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ: Value assigned to c->event_loop_info; same reason as above.\n\n- MHD_pool_allocate (declaration/definition): Although shown as a function call, it could be a macro or inline that contains control statements; its prototype is also needed to confirm the call has no embedded controlling expressions that affect this function.\n\n- false (stdbool.h or project definition): Used as the third argument to MHD_pool_allocate; necessary to resolve whether it is a macro/constant and if it participates in any conditional macros/expansions.\n\n- memset (declaration): Standard library call; included for completeness so the analyzer can ignore any hidden control constructs. (Usually not necessary to flag a MISRA control expression here, but included so the environment is fully known.)\n\n- size_t (typedef): Used for read_buf_size; type information may be required by static analysis tools to reason about expressions and invariance.\n\nIn short: the crucial items are mhd_assert and all symbols it references (HTTPS_SUPPORT, MHD_USE_TLS, TLS constants, MHD_CONNECTION_INIT) plus the concrete struct definitions (MHD_Connection, MHD_Daemon) and MHD_pool_allocate definition to detect any hidden/expanded control statements whose controlling expressions might be invariant."
