  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to check the MISRA rule (parameter shall not be modified):\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - The function modifies many fields via the parameter (c->...), so the struct definition is needed to confirm these are member accesses (allowed) and not operations that reassign the parameter variable itself (for example via weird operator overloading macros). It also lets an analyzer confirm there is no hidden macro trickery on member names.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon\n  - The code uses c->daemon->options and c->daemon->pool_size. The daemon struct definition is required to ensure those expressions are plain member reads (no macros or side-effecting accessors) and cannot cause an assignment to the parameter 'c'.\n\n- MHD_pool_allocate (declaration/definition)\n  - This function/macro is called with c->pool and its implementation (or macro expansion) must be inspected to ensure it does not perform any assignment to the caller's parameter variable 'c' (e.g. via token-pasting macros or by using the identifier \"c\" inside the macro) or otherwise alter the pointer 'c' itself.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/definition)\n  - mhd_assert is used with expressions referencing c. If mhd_assert is a macro that expands into code that could assign to variables (or call handlers that mutate caller-scope variables), that expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not modify the parameter variable 'c'.\n\n- MHD_CONN_KEEPALIVE_UNKOWN, MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ, MHD_CONNECTION_INIT\n  - These identifiers may be macros or complex expressions; their definitions must be checked to ensure they are simple constants/enums and do not expand into code that could assign to 'c' or otherwise modify the parameter variable.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS, MHD_TLS_CONN_INIT, MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS\n  - These are used inside the mhd_assert expressions. Their definitions (macros/values) should be checked to ensure they are not macros that expand into code with side effects that could modify 'c'.\n\n- type/definition of c->pool (MHD pool type)\n  - Knowing the exact type and its semantics lets the analyzer determine whether passing c->pool into MHD_pool_allocate (or a macro) could indirectly cause reassignment of the parameter variable (for example via a macro that expects an lvalue and reassigns it).\n\nIn short: inspect the struct/type definitions and the macros/functions used so you can be certain all uses of \"c\" in the body are member accesses or reads, and that no called macro/function expansion or macro-defined constant can reassign the parameter variable itself."
