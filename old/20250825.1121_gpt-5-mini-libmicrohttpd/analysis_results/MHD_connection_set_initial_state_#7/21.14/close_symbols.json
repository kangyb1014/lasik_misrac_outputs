  "explanation": "MHD_pool_allocate \u2014 The target function calls this allocator. To determine if any memcmp call (that compares null\u2011terminated strings) is reachable from the target, inspect MHD_pool_allocate implementation and any functions it calls for uses of memcmp. If memcmp is used there to compare C strings, that would make the target function transitively involved. mhd_assert \u2014 The source uses the mhd_assert macro in the function body. The macro/implementation may expand to helper code (logging, diagnostics) that could call library functions (including memcmp). Inspecting its definition ensures no hidden memcmp string comparisons are introduced via assertions. struct MHD_Connection \u2014 The function writes to many fields of this structure (read_buffer, read_buffer_size, rq, rp, etc.). You must inspect the structure definition and any invariants/documentation to know whether read_buffer (or other fields) is intended/used as a null\u2011terminated string elsewhere; this affects whether a memcmp usage on those fields would be comparing null\u2011terminated strings. struct MHD_Daemon \u2014 The function reads daemon->pool_size and daemon->options. The daemon type and related code may contain helpers accessed from this call chain that use memcmp on strings; examine it to rule that out and to verify that pool_size semantics do not imply string semantics for buffers. MHD_pool (type / allocator context) \u2014 The pool object (c->pool) and any pool metadata/implementation can contain helper routines that might use memcmp on allocated buffers or names. Inspect the pool type/implementation to ensure no memcmp is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings when allocating or initializing buffers."
