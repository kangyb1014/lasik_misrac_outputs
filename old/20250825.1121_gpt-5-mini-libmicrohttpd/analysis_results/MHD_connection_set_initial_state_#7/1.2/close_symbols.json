  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions we must examine all symbols/macros/types that could hide or expand to extensions. For each listed symbol we need the source/declaration so the analyzing agent can inspect whether it uses nonstandard constructs (GCC/Clang/other compiler __attribute__, '__extension__', statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, zero-length arrays, unnamed fields, asm, inline asm, special pragmas, or other documented compiler extensions). Reasons per symbol:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): The function manipulates many fields (daemon, pool, rq, rp, read_buffer, etc.). The struct definition must be checked for nonstandard constructs (flexible/zero-length arrays, unnamed bit-fields, compiler-specific attributes on members, inline function members, or use of VLA in struct) that would be language extensions.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (full definition): c->daemon is accessed (options, pool_size). The daemon struct may contain extensions (bitfields, attributes) or macros that expand to compiler-specific constructs.\n\n- MHD_pool_allocate (declaration/definition/source): The call site passes arguments including false. The allocate routine or its prototype could be a macro, inline function, or use compiler attributes or extensions (e.g., GCC statement-expr, attribute((...)), or nonstandard parameter types). We must inspect its declaration and implementation for extensions.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/definition/source): The code uses mhd_assert with a multiline expression. mhd_assert may expand to complex macros that use compiler extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, __builtin_unreachable, __attribute__, inline asm). Inspecting its definition is required.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS, MHD_TLS_CONN_INIT, MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS, MHD_CONNECTION_INIT, MHD_CONN_KEEPALIVE_UNKOWN, MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ (macro/enum definitions): These constants/macros could be defined via extension constructs (e.g., as enum values with attributes, as macros that expand to GCC/Clang builtins, or as bit-field initializers using extensions). We must see their definitions to ensure they are plain C.\n\n- type and definition of c->pool (pool object/type used by MHD_pool_allocate): The pool object type might be an opaque pointer type or a struct that uses extensions (flexible array, attributes). Its definition is needed to determine if passing it or using it relies on extensions.\n\n- definition of false (stdbool.h or local boolean macro): The code uses false. The definition could be a macro or typedef that hides an extension; verifying it comes from standard <stdbool.h> or a compliant definition is necessary.\n\n- typedef/definition of size_t: size_t is used. Although standard, project may typedef it in a nonstandard way or via compiler-specific builtin; verifying its standard definition ensures no extension is in use.\n\n- memset (prototype or included header): While memset is standard C, if the project replaced it with a macro that expands to compiler builtins or extensions, that would matter. Confirming the prototype/definition ensures no extension is being invoked.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their declarations/definitions and, where applicable, implementation/source) lets the next agent inspect whether any of them \u2014 or the target function through their use \u2014 rely on compiler-specific language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
