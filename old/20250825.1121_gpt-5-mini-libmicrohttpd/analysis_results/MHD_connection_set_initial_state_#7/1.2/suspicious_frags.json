  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the given function. I inspected the entire snippet for known extensions that compilers document (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __extension__ tokens, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_* uses, __declspec, Microsoft-specific keywords, inline asm, exotic storage-classes, or other vendor-specific keywords). None are used.\n\nSpecific notes to justify not reporting fragments:\n- The backslash at the end of lines in the mhd_assert expressions is a standard preprocessor line-continuation and not a compiler extension.\n- Use of identifiers such as size_t, memset, and struct access (c->...) are standard C library and language features, not extensions.\n- The literal false passed to MHD_pool_allocate is not in itself a compiler extension; it is either the C99/C11 boolean false from <stdbool.h> or a project-defined macro/identifier, neither of which are compiler language extensions documented by vendors.\n- There are no uses of compiler-specific keywords (e.g., __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __builtin_*), no nested functions, no statement expressions, and no other vendor-specific constructs.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions)."
