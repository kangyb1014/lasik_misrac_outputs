  "explanation": "No loop controlling expressions in init_response_body_data are invariant. The function contains two for-loops: 1) for (filler_pos = 0; filler_pos < (body_dyn_size - (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(body_header) + MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(body_footer))); ++filler_pos) \u2014 the controlling expression depends on filler_pos which is incremented each iteration, so it is variant. 2) for (pos = 0; pos < body_dyn_size; ++pos) \u2014 the controlling expression depends on pos which is incremented each iteration, so it is variant. There are no while or do-while loops or other iteration statements with constant/invariant controlling expressions (e.g., while(1) or for(;;)). The if-conditionals (if (0 != body_dyn_size), if (NULL == body_dyn), if (tool_params.medium)) are not iteration controlling expressions relevant to MISRA C Rule 14.3 as scoped by the provided rule text and exceptions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
