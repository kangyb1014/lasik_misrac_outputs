  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA C rule about const-qualified pointers:\n\n- body_dyn\n  - Need the declaration and type (storage, linkage, and qualifications) of this global/extern variable to determine whether it is declared as char * or as a const-qualified pointer. The function writes into body_dyn (memcpy and element assignments); to decide if the pointer should be const-qualified (or intentionally non-const) we must inspect its original declaration and uses elsewhere.\n\n- body_dyn_size\n  - Need its declaration/type to confirm its signedness/size type and whether it is mutable. Also to see if it is a macro or variable and how allocation size is computed; indirectly relevant because whether body_dyn must be writable depends on how its size/usage is managed.\n\n- tool_params and tool_params.medium\n  - Need the definition/type of tool_params and the type of the medium member to know if tool_params is an object or a pointer and whether accessing medium involves any pointer indirection. If tool_params were actually a pointer expression (or a macro expanding to one) that would affect whether any pointer should or should not be const-qualified.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_\n  - This macro (or function) is used repeatedly to compute lengths of static string constants. Its definition is needed to ensure it does not perform casts that remove const qualification, or otherwise yield types that affect pointer constness when used with memcpy or indexing.\n\n- malloc\n  - The prototype/definition is needed to confirm return type (void *) and to check whether the code performs any casts that affect const qualification. MISRA concerns sometimes involve conversions between void * and other pointer types; the malloc signature and any project-specific replacement are needed.\n\n- memcpy\n  - The standard prototype has a const-qualified source parameter (const void *). To verify that the memcpy calls respect const qualification (source is const char[]; destination is non-const char *), we need the actual prototype in scope (or confirm standard prototype is used).\n\n- fprintf and stderr\n  - Their prototypes and declarations are required to confirm that passing the string literal to fprintf does not drop const qualification and that stderr is the standard FILE * (no unusual typedef that might affect constness). This is mainly to ensure no hidden pointer-qualification issues arise from I/O calls.\n\nThese symbols together let the next analyst determine whether any pointer used or assigned in init_response_body_data should instead be declared with a const qualifier (or whether it is correctly non-const because the function writes through it), and to detect any places where const qualification might be inadvertently discarded by macros, casts, or nonstandard function signatures."
