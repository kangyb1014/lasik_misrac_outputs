  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is about ensuring pointers point to const-qualified types when they do not need to modify the pointed-to objects. The code fragments selected are all places where a non-const char * is declared or used to receive or store data and thus should be reviewed to confirm that non-const is required. Other pointer-related fragments in the function do not need investigation: the string literals are declared with const-qualified arrays (they already comply), uses of those const arrays occur as read-only sources (e.g. memcpy source), and loop/index variables and arithmetic are not pointer-type qualifications. Therefore only the listed non-const pointer declaration/uses warrant inspection for potential missing const qualification."
