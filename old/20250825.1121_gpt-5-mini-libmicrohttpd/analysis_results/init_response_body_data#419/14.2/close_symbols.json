The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) body_dyn_size \u2014 the loop conditions use this global; to check MISRA rule 2/3 we must know its type and whether it can be modified (or is volatile/atomic) inside the loop body or by called code. If it can change as a side effect, the loops might violate the requirement that the second clause not use objects modified in the loop body.\\n\\n2) body_dyn \u2014 the loop bodies write into body_dyn[]. The analysis must confirm that body_dyn is not used in any loop header expressions (would violate rule 2/3) and whether writes to it have any aliasing or side effects that could affect header expressions.\\n\\n3) MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ \u2014 this macro/function is used repeatedly in the for-condition and in the modulo expression. You must see its definition to ensure it has no persistent side effects, returns a pure length value, and does not access/modify objects that are modified in the loop body (as MISRA forbids side effects in the second clause).\\n\\n4) tool_params.medium \u2014 selects which for-loop executes (text filler loop vs binary loop). Knowing its type and that it is not a loop control flag or modified inside the loop is necessary to choose the correct loop to analyze and to ensure no hidden loop-control interaction.\\n\\n5) body_filler \u2014 used in the body of the text-fill loop (indexing and used inside the modulo). The analyzer must confirm its size/definition (used by MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_) and that its use does not introduce side effects or dependency on objects modified inside the loop.\\n\\n6) body_header, body_footer \u2014 their lengths are used in computing the loop bound for filler_pos. Their sizes (as computed by MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_) must be known to verify the second-clause expression only depends on the loop counter and constants (and not on objects modified in the loop body).\\n\\nNote: local loop counters (pos, filler_pos) and the local static arrays themselves are present in the function source; the symbols above are the additional external/definition-level items required to determine whether the for loops meet the MISRA well-formedness constraints (no side effects in clauses, only the loop counter modified in the third clause, and no other objects modified in the loop body that are referenced in the loop header)."
