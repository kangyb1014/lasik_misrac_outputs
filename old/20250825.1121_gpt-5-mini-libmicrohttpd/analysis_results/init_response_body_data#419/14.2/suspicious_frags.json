  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only for-loop constructs are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (well-formed for loops). The two code fragments above are the only for statements in the function and therefore are the items that must be investigated for compliance (initialization clause, loop-test clause side-effects and object usage, and iteration clause modifying only the loop counter; single loop counter not modified in the loop body). Other parts of the function are not for statements and thus are not applicable to Rule 14.2: - Memory allocation (malloc) and its NULL check do not affect for-loop clause formation. - memcpy calls and the subsequent pos adjustments are not for statements. - Declarations of body_header/body_filler/body_footer and the macro MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ expand to constant-size computations; they are not loop constructs (they may be used by the loops, but they themselves are not for-statements). - The if/else structure and return statement are control flow but not for loops. - Assignments to body_dyn outside or after the loops (e.g. pos += filler_pos) are not for-loop headers or iteration expressions. Therefore only the two for-loop fragments listed need investigation under Rule 14.2."
