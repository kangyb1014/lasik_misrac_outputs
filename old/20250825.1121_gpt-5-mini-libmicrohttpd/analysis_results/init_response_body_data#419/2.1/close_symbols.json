  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in init_response_body_data is statically or effectively unreachable you must know which conditional/loop guards and initial values can ever take the values that enable or disable the code paths. The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- body_dyn_size: This global controls the outermost if (0 != body_dyn_size). If body_dyn_size is always 0 (or provably always non-zero) then large portions of the function are unreachable (or always reached). You must inspect its declaration and all assignments (in particular those performed before the call, e.g. in init_data) to decide reachability.\n\n- body_dyn: The function assigns to body_dyn via malloc. Knowing whether body_dyn is used/initialized elsewhere, and its declaration/type, helps determine whether later code (memcpy/loops filling body_dyn) is meaningful or optimized away by whole-program analysis. Also some projects may override allocation semantics via macros or wrappers affecting control flow.\n\n- tool_params: The medium field (tool_params.medium) determines which of the two mutually exclusive filling branches executes (HTML-like filler vs. binary filler). If tool_params.medium is a compile-time constant or is always one value at the call site, the other branch is unreachable. You must inspect the tool_params definition and initialization prior to the call.\n\n- init_data: init_data is the caller shown in the call graph. You need to examine init_data's implementation (and any functions it calls) to see how body_dyn_size and tool_params are initialized before init_response_body_data is invoked. Without examining init_data you cannot determine whether some branches are ever taken at run-time.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: This macro/function computes the lengths used in memcpy and the filler loop bounds. Its exact definition (e.g. does it include the terminating NUL or is it a compile-time sizeof-like macro) affects the loop bound arithmetic: it can make the filler loop iterate zero times or cause the subtraction in the loop bound to underflow/produce a large unsigned value, which changes whether that loop body is reachable. You must inspect its definition.\n\n- malloc: The path that handles allocation failure (NULL == body_dyn) immediately prints an error and returns. To judge whether the remainder of the function could be unreachable due to guaranteed allocation failure or a wrapper that longjmps/terminates, you need to know the actual malloc implementation or any project-specific wrapper/macro that replaces malloc.\n\n- fprintf (and stderr): The error-handling branch uses fprintf(stderr, ...). If fprintf is replaced by a macro or a function that does non-local control transfer (rare but possible in some embedded projects), the code following that call might be unreachable. Inspect fprintf/stderr definitions or replacements in the project.\n\n- memcpy: Included because the two memcpy calls and the filler loop are the main code inside the enabled branch. If memcpy is a macro/wrapper with side-effects (or annotated in a way that causes removal of subsequent code), it can affect reachability reasoning. Also understanding how the block is filled (memcpy lengths depend on MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_) is necessary to determine whether the filling loop executes.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any part of init_response_body_data is unreachable under MISRA C you must inspect the global variables that control flow (body_dyn_size, tool_params), the caller that sets them (init_data), the macros that compute string lengths (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_), and any replaced/wrapped standard functions (malloc, fprintf, memcpy) that could change control flow semantics. Reviewing these symbols\u2019 definitions and initializations will allow a sound determination of unreachable code."
