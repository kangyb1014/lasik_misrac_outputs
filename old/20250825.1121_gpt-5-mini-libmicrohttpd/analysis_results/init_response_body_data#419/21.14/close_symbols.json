  "explanation": "- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: This macro is used to compute lengths of the string literals (body_header, body_filler, body_footer). Its definition must be inspected to ensure it does not expand to or invoke memcmp (or any indirect string-comparison that would violate the MISRA rule). If it uses sizeof(expr)-1 it is safe; if it uses a function like strlen or other helpers, those helpers must be checked.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets use of the Standard Library memcmp on null-terminated strings. The global/function-level definition or any macro alias for memcmp must be checked to ensure no use (direct or via macro expansion) compares null-terminated strings in this translation unit or in the macros used here.\n- body_dyn_size: The code path (HTML-like vs binary) and how much of the static strings are copied depends on body_dyn_size. Knowing its value/type helps determine whether any string data created/used here are null-terminated and therefore whether a subsequent memcmp (or any comparison) would operate on null-terminated strings.\n- body_dyn: The allocated buffer and how it is filled (whether a terminating '\\0' is written) affect whether the data in it are null-terminated strings. To decide if memcmp would be used on null-terminated strings, the buffer contents and termination semantics must be known.\n- tool_params.medium: This flag selects the HTML-like branch (which copies and tiles string literals) versus the binary branch. Only the HTML-like branch produces data derived from null-terminated string literals, so this flag is necessary to know which code path is active for analysis of string comparisons.\n- memcpy: The function called in this routine is memcpy; its usage should be distinguished from memcmp. Confirming that memcpy (not memcmp) is used here rules out direct violations in this function, and confirms whether any length computations passed to memcpy rely on macros that might involve memcmp-like behavior."
