  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function uses memcpy for copying fixed-length string literals (with MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ to exclude the terminating NUL), and direct byte assignments for binary content. The macro MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ is defined using sizeof and does not perform any runtime string comparison. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
