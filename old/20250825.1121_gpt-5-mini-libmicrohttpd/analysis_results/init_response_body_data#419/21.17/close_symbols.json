  "explanation": "For a sound MISRA C analysis of possible out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses from the <string.h> functions in init_response_body_data the next agent must be able to determine the sizes and values used in the memcpy calls and the filler loop bounds and whether arithmetic can underflow/wrap. Each symbol is required for the following reason: \n\n- body_dyn_size: determines the number of bytes allocated (malloc(body_dyn_size)) and is used in the computation body_dyn_size - (len_header + len_footer). If body_dyn_size is smaller than header+footer the subtraction underflows (size_t wrap) and the filler loop will write far beyond the allocated buffer. You must know its type and possible value/range. \n\n- body_dyn: the destination buffer pointer. You need to know whether it actually points to an allocated object of size body_dyn_size (or is manipulated elsewhere) to decide if memcpy/memory writes are within bounds. \n\n- tool_params and tool_params.medium: the boolean/flag controls which branch executes (HTML-like path that uses memcpy and complex bounds arithmetic vs binary filler). The analysis must know which branch can run (or both) to check each code path for violations. \n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: this macro computes the lengths passed to memcpy and used in loop bounds and modulo operations. Its precise definition (e.g. sizeof(x)-1 or other) is required to compute the exact length arguments and to check that memcpy(dest, src, len) does not read beyond the source or write beyond the destination. \n\n- memcpy (from <string.h>): the standard function being judged by the MISRA rule. Its prototype/semantics (parameter types, size parameter interpretation) are needed to reason about the correctness of each call. \n\n- malloc (from <stdlib.h>): although not a string.h symbol, knowing its prototype and semantics is needed to verify that body_dyn receives an allocation of body_dyn_size bytes and to confirm the relationship between allocation size and subsequent memcpy/writes. \n\n- size_t: the integer type used for sizes and loop variables; required to reason about unsigned arithmetic, potential underflow/wraparound behavior in expressions such as body_dyn_size - (len_header + len_footer) and loop bounds. \n\n- init_data: the caller shown in the static call graph. init_data (and any other translation unit code that initializes body_dyn_size or tool_params) must be inspected to determine the possible runtime values of body_dyn_size and tool_params.medium prior to the call. Without knowing how these globals are set, you cannot conclude whether the subtraction/loops are safe.\n\n(Notes: The function-local static arrays body_header/body_filler/body_footer are present in the target function and therefore do not need to be listed as additional symbols. stderr/fprintf are not relevant to bounds checking of memcpy writes.)"
