  "explanation": "- vfprintf: You must inspect the library declaration of vfprintf (prototype/attributes) to ensure the function is a standard C library symbol and not declared with compiler-specific extensions (eg. GCC __attribute__ annotations or nonstandard linkage). Any extension in its declaration could imply use of a language extension in this translation unit.\n- fflush: Same reason as vfprintf \u2014 check the prototype/attributes of fflush in the implementation headers to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are used.\n- FILE: The FILE type is used via a cast ((FILE *) cls). Its definition comes from the implementation headers; you need to see how FILE is defined (typedef/structure) to confirm no implementation-specific/extension features are required or relied upon by the cast.\n- va_list: vfprintf is called with a va_list parameter; va_list\u2019s implementation may be a compiler builtin (e.g. __builtin_va_list) or otherwise use compiler-specific semantics. Inspecting va_list\u2019s definition is necessary to determine whether the code depends on a compiler extension.\n- _DEBUG: This conditional compilation macro controls whether fflush is called. You must know whether _DEBUG is a compiler-provided predefined macro (an implementation extension) or a project-defined macro, since reliance on compiler-predefined macros can constitute use of a language/compiler extension."
