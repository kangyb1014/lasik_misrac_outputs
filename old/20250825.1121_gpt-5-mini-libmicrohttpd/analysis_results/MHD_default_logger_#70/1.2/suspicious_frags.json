  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided fragment. The code only uses standard C constructs and library facilities: vfprintf, fflush, FILE, va_list and a simple cast (FILE *)cls. There are no GCC/MSVC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __declspec, __cdecl, anonymous structures/unions as extensions, or other implementation-only keywords. The #ifdef _DEBUG uses a macro name that may be predefined by a build environment or toolchain, but its use is a standard preprocessor conditional rather than a language extension; likewise the cast from void* to FILE* and use of va_list are standard C. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
