  "explanation": "Each symbol is needed to decide whether this function (MHD_default_logger_) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings:\n\n- vfprintf: The function directly calls vfprintf. To determine if the logger uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must examine vfprintf's implementation or specification. If the platform's vfprintf implementation uses memcmp on C-strings (format string or %s arguments) that could be relevant to the MISRA rule analysis.\n\n- fflush: Called conditionally under _DEBUG. Although it is unlikely to compare strings, the fflush implementation should be checked if library calls are considered in-scope for the rule.\n\n- FILE: The cls pointer is cast to (FILE *). Understanding the FILE type/layout and whether cls really refers to a FILE* (and how library functions treat that object) is necessary to see if any indirect call paths (through FILE operations) might use memcmp on C-strings.\n\n- va_list: The function forwards the va_list to vfprintf. To determine whether any string comparisons occur you must consider how the va_list is consumed by vfprintf (e.g., for %s arguments), so the va_list concept and its usage are relevant.\n\n- fm (const char * format string parameter): The format string is a C-string passed to vfprintf. The analysis must consider whether the format string itself or its parsing (by vfprintf) leads to memcmp usage.\n\n- cls (void * parameter cast to FILE *): The cast is central to how the function hands the object to vfprintf/fflush; verifying the correctness of that cast and how the resulting FILE* is used may reveal indirect string comparisons.\n\n- _DEBUG (preprocessor macro): Controls whether fflush is invoked. The presence/absence of the macro changes the call graph; to determine rule compliance in all build configurations you must consider both cases.\n\n- <stdio.h>: Declares vfprintf, fflush and FILE. For a complete analysis you need the standard declarations and any platform-specific macros or mappings that could redirect these calls to other library routines that might use memcmp.\n\n- <stdarg.h>: Declares va_list and the semantics of forwarding varargs to vfprintf. Understanding the varargs mechanism is necessary to see how string arguments are passed to vfprintf.\n\nNote: The MISRA C rule targets direct use of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings in the analyzed source. If you treat calls into the standard library as in-scope, you must inspect the implementations of vfprintf/fflush (and any intermediate wrappers) for usage of memcmp. If library internals are out-of-scope, the above symbols are sufficient to conclude that this source does not directly call memcmp."
