  "explanation": "The provided function contains no calls to memcmp nor any other code that compares strings bytewise. The only string-related identifier is the format string parameter 'fm' used with vfprintf, which does not perform string comparisons. There are no wrapper functions or macros in this fragment that could hide a memcmp call. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
