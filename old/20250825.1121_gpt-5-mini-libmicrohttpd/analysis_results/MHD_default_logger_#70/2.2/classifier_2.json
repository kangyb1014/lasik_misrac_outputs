  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_default_logger_:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_default_logger_ (void *cls,\n                     const char *fm,\n                     va_list ap)\n{\n  vfprintf ((FILE *) cls, fm, ap);\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n  fflush ((FILE *) cls);\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n  fflush ((FILE *) cls);\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fflush call is inside an #ifdef _DEBUG conditional, so it is compiled and executed only in debug builds. It is not unreachable and its removal could change observable behavior (output flushing/timing) in those builds, so it is not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
