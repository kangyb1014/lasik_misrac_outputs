  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to assess 'pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible':\n\n- vfprintf (prototype): vfprintf's first parameter type and const qualifiers determine whether the value produced by casting cls to (FILE *) is required to be a non-const FILE*. If vfprintf requires a non-const FILE*, cls cannot reasonably be a pointer-to-const without forcing a const discard/cast at the call site, which is relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\n- fflush (prototype): fflush likewise declares whether a non-const FILE* is required. Because fflush is called (conditionally), its parameter type affects whether cls can be declared as pointing to const.\n\n- FILE (typedef/struct definition): Knowing the concrete typedef/definition of FILE is necessary to determine if const qualification makes semantic sense for that type (e.g., whether FILE objects are intended to be mutable and whether const FILE * would be compatible with library APIs). It also clarifies pointer compatibility rules for casts between void * and FILE *.\n\n- va_list (typedef): Although less directly about const qualification of cls, va_list's definition ensures the vfprintf prototype is correctly understood (the ap parameter type) and rules about passing variadic argument lists are met; include to ensure no hidden const/qualification interaction via the varargs API.\n\n- All call sites of MHD_default_logger_: To decide whether cls ``should'' be const you must see how the logger is actually used. If every caller passes a non-const FILE* (e.g., stdout, file handles), making cls a const-qualified pointer would be incorrect or require casts at the call sites. Conversely, if some callers pass pointers that are const-qualified, the function signature may violate the MISRA guidance. Inspecting call sites determines the practical possible const qualification.\n\n- _DEBUG macro definition: The fflush call is conditionally compiled under _DEBUG. Whether fflush is present affects whether the function actually needs a non-const FILE* in the compiled build. If fflush is omitted, the set of required non-const usages may differ, so the macro definition affects the const-qualification analysis.\n\n- Prototype of MHD_default_logger_ as seen by callers (header): The public declaration used by callers determines what types/qualifiers callers expect to pass. If a header already declares cls as void * or as const void *, that impacts whether the current implementation violates the rule or requires changing caller code.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether cls could/should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type without causing incompatibilities with library calls or breaking caller code, which is the heart of the MISRA rule under review."
