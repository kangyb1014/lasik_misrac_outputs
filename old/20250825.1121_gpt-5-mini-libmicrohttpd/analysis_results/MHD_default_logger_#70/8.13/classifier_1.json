  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The pointer is used as a modifiable FILE stream passed to vfprintf, which alters the FILE object\u2019s state. Thus it must be a pointer to a non-const FILE; making it const would be inappropriate. The cast from void * to FILE * is therefore not a violation of Rule 8.13."
