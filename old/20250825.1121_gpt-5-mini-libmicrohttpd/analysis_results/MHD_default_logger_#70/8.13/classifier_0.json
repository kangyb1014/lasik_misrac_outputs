  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the void *cls is cast to FILE * and passed to vfprintf and fflush, which may modify the FILE object state, so the pointee cannot be const-qualified. The cast is therefore necessary and does not breach Rule 8.13. (A violation would occur if a const-qualified object had its const discarded by casting to a non-const pointer, which is not happening here.)"
