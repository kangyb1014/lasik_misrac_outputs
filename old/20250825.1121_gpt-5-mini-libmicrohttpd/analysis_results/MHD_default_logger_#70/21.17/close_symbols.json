  "explanation": "To decide if MHD_default_logger_ violates the MISRA C rule about out-of-bounds use of <string.h> functions you must inspect not only the call sites in the target function but also the implementations of library routines it invokes and any data structures they touch. Each listed symbol is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- vfprintf: Directly called by the target. Its implementation performs format processing and buffer writes; it may call string handling functions internally.\n\n- fflush: Called conditionally under _DEBUG. Its implementation flushes FILE buffers and may interact with buffer-management helpers that in turn use memory/string operations.\n\n- __vfprintf_internal, vsnprintf, vsprintf: Common internal or alternate implementations of vfprintf functionality. Static analysis must consider these variants because they perform formatting and may use string/memory routines.\n\n- fwrite, fputc, putc: I/O helpers that vfprintf may call to write formatted output into FILE buffers or to the underlying descriptor; these may move/copy buffer contents and thus may invoke memory/string routines.\n\n- memcpy, memmove, memset, strlen, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, memcmp, strspn: The MISRA rule targets these standard string/memory functions. vfprintf/fflush or their helpers may call one or more of these; to determine a violation you must inspect whether any of these are invoked and whether their pointer/length arguments can reference beyond object bounds.\n\n- FILE (implementation-specific layout): To reason about buffer boundaries and pointers used by vfprintf/fflush you need the definition (or at least the relevant members) of FILE for the C library used (buffer pointers, buffer size, current position). Out-of-bounds accesses often depend on these internals.\n\n- va_list: The mechanism used to pass variadic arguments into vfprintf. To ensure no string functions are called with invalid pointers or lengths extracted from the variadic list, the analysis must consider how va_list contents are interpreted by vfprintf.\n\nIn short: inspect vfprintf/fflush and any internal helpers they dispatch to, the concrete FILE buffer layout, the handling of va_list, and any string.h routines those implementations may call. Only by analyzing those symbols can you establish whether any string/memory function could be invoked with pointers or lengths that lead to out-of-bounds accesses."
