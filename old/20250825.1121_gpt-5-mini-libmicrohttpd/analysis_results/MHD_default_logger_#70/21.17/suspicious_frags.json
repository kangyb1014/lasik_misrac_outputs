  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions are present in the provided code fragment. The only library functions used are vfprintf and fflush (both from <stdio.h>), which are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (the rule targets functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). Therefore there are no code locations here that need investigation for Rule 21.17. (Note: the cast of cls to (FILE *) could be examined for other MISRA concerns, but it is not relevant to Rule 21.17.)"
