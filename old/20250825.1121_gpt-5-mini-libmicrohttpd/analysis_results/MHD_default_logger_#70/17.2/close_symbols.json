  "explanation": "- vfprintf: Direct call from MHD_default_logger_. You must inspect vfprintf\u2019s call graph to determine whether it (or any functions it calls) can call back to MHD_default_logger_ (indirect recursion).- fflush: Conditionally called when _DEBUG is defined. Include fflush to see whether it (or any of its callees) can call back into the logger (indirect recursion).- FILE: The cls argument is cast to (FILE *). The concrete FILE implementation (or a custom stream object) determines what vfprintf/fflush actually do; a custom FILE implementation may invoke user callbacks that could call the logger. You need the FILE symbol/type information and any custom stream wiring to decide possible callbacks.- _DEBUG: Preprocessor symbol controls whether fflush is invoked. To know whether the fflush path participates in recursion you must know whether _DEBUG is defined in the build being analyzed.- fwrite, fputc, write (low-level I/O functions): Typical callees/internal helpers used by vfprintf/fflush. Include these to follow the full call chain from vfprintf/fflush down to system I/O where a hook or callback could re-enter the logger.- user-defined FILE stream callbacks: If the FILE* refers to a user-supplied/custom stream, that stream\u2019s write/flush callbacks (not a single fixed symbol) must be examined because they are the plausible places where control could return to the MHD logger, producing indirect recursion.\n\nIn short: include the direct callees (vfprintf, fflush), the FILE type and build-time flag that enable the fflush path, and the downstream I/O routines and any user-supplied stream callbacks so you can trace the complete call chain and detect any path that returns to MHD_default_logger_.\n"
