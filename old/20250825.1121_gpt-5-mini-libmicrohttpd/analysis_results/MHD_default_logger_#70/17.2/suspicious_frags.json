  "explanation": "No direct self-call to MHD_default_logger_ is present in the code. The only places in this function that perform calls to other functions are the two lines reported above; everything else (the function signature, casts to (FILE *), static qualifier, parameter list, preprocessor conditional, and braces) does not perform calls and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect recursion by itself. Consequently, only the function-call expressions shown need investigation for potential indirect recursion paths."
