  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (a function parameter shall not be modified):\n\n- vfprintf (prototype): needed to know the exact parameter types (particularly that the third parameter is va_list) and whether vfprintf is a function or a macro/inline on this platform. If vfprintf's signature takes va_list by value, modifications inside vfprintf affect only the callee's copy; if the prototype uses a type that decays to a pointer or is a macro that manipulates the caller's object, that could imply modification of the caller's parameter.\n\n- fflush (prototype): needed to confirm its parameter type (FILE *) and to verify fflush does not modify the pointer parameter variable 'cls' itself (it operates on the FILE object), and whether fflush might be a macro that could contain code modifying caller parameters.\n\n- va_list typedef / definition: crucial because the semantics of passing va_list depend on how va_list is defined by the implementation (it can be an array type, pointer-like type, or struct). Whether passing ap to vfprintf results in a copy or allows the callee to modify the caller's ap depends on this definition.\n\n- FILE type definition: to understand what casting (FILE *) cls means and whether any implementations represent FILE in a way that could cause pointer-parameter aliasing or hidden modifications; also to check if any stdio macros could expand to code that modifies the parameter variable.\n\n- _DEBUG macro definition: the conditional controls whether fflush is invoked. To fully determine if any parameter-modifying call is reachable in the built configuration, the presence/absence of _DEBUG must be known.\n\n- Target compiler / platform ABI rules for passing va_list: even with the typedef, platform calling conventions (and compiler-specific details) determine whether va_list is passed by value or by reference under the hood. This information resolves whether calling vfprintf with ap can modify the caller's ap parameter (which would violate the MISRA rule if ap itself were altered)."
