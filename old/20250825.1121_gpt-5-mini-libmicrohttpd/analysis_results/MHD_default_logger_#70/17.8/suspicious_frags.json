  "explanation": "I examined all function parameters (void *cls, const char *fm, va_list ap) and each use in the body. There are no assignments to any parameter, no increment/decrement or pointer arithmetic on them, and no reinitialisation of any parameter. The casts (FILE *) cls do not modify the parameter itself \u2014 they only create a temporary pointer value used in calls. The parameters are only passed by value to vfprintf and fflush; this function does not alter the parameter variables in its own scope. Therefore no code fragment in this function appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
