  "explanation": "The parameters realm, username, password and userdigest are already const-qualified, so they do not require investigation for Rule 8.13. The local variable da (struct DigestAlgorithm da) is explicitly initialized and deinitialized via digest_setup_zero(&da) and digest_deinit(&da) and is therefore intentionally mutable; it should not be const. The local buffer variable buf is assigned by the inner call and later freed (free(buf)), indicating it refers to dynamically allocated, modifiable memory and thus should remain non-const. Scalar parameters (nonce_timeout, max_nc, mqop, malgo3) are non-pointer types and not subject to this pointer-to-const rule. Other lines in the function either read const-qualified pointers or perform obvious mutable operations (initialization/free), so they do not need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
