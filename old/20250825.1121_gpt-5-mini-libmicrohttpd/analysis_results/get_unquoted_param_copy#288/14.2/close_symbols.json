Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether get_unquoted_param_copy (and the functions it calls) violate the MISRA rule on well-formed for loops you must inspect any for-loops in the function and in any functions it calls (the rule counts effects of called functions as part of the loop body). The following symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- get_buffer_for_size (full definition): This function is called from get_unquoted_param_copy and may contain for loops or modify objects (tmp1, *ptmp2, *ptmp2_size). You must inspect its loops to check loop counters, side-effects and whether it modifies objects that the caller also uses.\n\n- MHD_str_unquote (full definition): This function is called and performs unquoting into unquoted->str and returns a length. It may contain for loops; you must inspect them for loop-counter usage, side-effects, and whether it modifies objects that interact with caller state.\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuthParam (full definition): To know exact types of param->value.str, param->value.len and param->quoted (e.g. pointer/size_t/boolean) because the MISRA rule restricts which objects may be used/modified in loop clauses and body. Knowledge of types is needed to determine whether loops in callee functions read/modify objects that violate the rule.\n\n- struct _MHD_mstr_w_len (full definition): To know types of unquoted->str and unquoted->len (and whether they alias other storage); needed to decide if loops in callees modify objects that the caller's for loop would use or if there are multiple loop counters or non-local modifications.\n\n- _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE (macro/constant): The static buffer size influences how get_buffer_for_size chooses/returns buffers and may affect control flow inside that function; include to fully understand possible code paths and loop behaviour.\n\n- _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE (macro/constant): Used in the overflow/size check that affects the return path; include to ensure branches that avoid/enter loops are correctly considered.\n\n- enum _MHD_GetUnqResult and enumerators: To understand the function's return-value control flow (which branches return early) so you can determine which code paths (and thus which called functions and their loops) are actually reachable.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro definition): The assert macro could expand to code (potentially containing control flow) that affects whether loops execute or which objects are accessed; must verify it does not itself contain for-loops or alter loop-related objects.\n\nIf any of get_buffer_for_size or MHD_str_unquote call further functions or use additional macros, include those callee definitions/macros as well, since the MISRA rule requires considering the behaviour of called functions as part of the for loop body."
