Specifically, if struct _MHD_str_w_len has a member declared as 'char *str;' then MHD_RqDAuthParam.value.str points to mutable characters even though functions (e.g. get_unquoted_param_copy) treat it as read-only (the param argument is 'const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *'). This allows modification of the pointed-to characters through that pointer and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Fix: change the inner pointer to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const char *str;').\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function get_unquoted_param_copy:\nstruct MHD_RqDAuthParam\n{\n  /**\n   * The string with length, NOT zero-terminated\n   */\n  struct _MHD_str_w_len value;\n  /**\n   * True if string must be \"unquoted\" before processing.\n   * This member is false if the string is used in DQUOTE marks, but no\n   * backslash-escape is used in the string.\n   */\n  bool quoted;\n}\n...\nstruct _MHD_mstr_w_len\n{\n  char *str;\n  size_t len;\n}\n...\nstatic char *\nget_buffer_for_size (char tmp1[_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE],\n                     char **ptmp2,\n                     size_t *ptmp2_size,\n                     size_t required_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || (NULL != *ptmp2));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL != *ptmp2) || (0 == *ptmp2_size));\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || \\\n              (_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE < *ptmp2_size));\n\n  if (required_size <= _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE)\n    return tmp1;\n\n  if (required_size <= *ptmp2_size)\n    return *ptmp2;\n\n  if (required_size > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE)\n    return NULL;\n  if (NULL != *ptmp2)\n    free (*ptmp2);\n  *ptmp2 = (char *) malloc (required_size);\n  if (NULL == *ptmp2)\n    *ptmp2_size = 0;\n  else\n    *ptmp2_size = required_size;\n  return *ptmp2;\n}\n...\nsize_t\nMHD_str_unquote (const char *quoted,\n                 size_t quoted_len,\n                 char *result)\n{\n  size_t r;\n  size_t w;\n\n  r = 0;\n  w = 0;\n\n  while (quoted_len > r)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[r])\n    {\n      ++r;\n      if (quoted_len == r)\n        return 0; /* Last backslash is not followed by char to unescape */\n    }\n    result[w++] = quoted[r++];\n  }\n  return w;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is essentially correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever the pointee is not modified. In the presented code the incoming parameter is declared as const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param, but the underlying string-with-length type exposes a char *str (non-const). In get_unquoted_param_copy the code only reads from param->value.str (memcpy and passing it to a function taking const char *), so the pointee is effectively read-only here. Declaring the member as const char *str in the string-with-length type would reflect the read-only intent and satisfy Rule 8.13. Note that the mutable destination structure (_MHD_mstr_w_len with char *str) must remain non-const because the code writes into that buffer; the violation is in the source/string-with-length declaration, not in the local use inside get_unquoted_param_copy. Also be aware that changing the member to const char * may require propagating const-correctness throughout the codebase where that type is used."
