According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, such a pointer should be declared pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. const char *). The memcpy call memcpy(unquoted->str, param->value.str, param->value.len); therefore exposes the violation: param->value.str should be const-qualified.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function get_unquoted_param_copy:\nstruct MHD_RqDAuthParam\n{\n  /**\n   * The string with length, NOT zero-terminated\n   */\n  struct _MHD_str_w_len value;\n  /**\n   * True if string must be \"unquoted\" before processing.\n   * This member is false if the string is used in DQUOTE marks, but no\n   * backslash-escape is used in the string.\n   */\n  bool quoted;\n}\n...\nstruct _MHD_mstr_w_len\n{\n  char *str;\n  size_t len;\n}\n...\nstatic char *\nget_buffer_for_size (char tmp1[_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE],\n                     char **ptmp2,\n                     size_t *ptmp2_size,\n                     size_t required_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || (NULL != *ptmp2));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL != *ptmp2) || (0 == *ptmp2_size));\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || \\\n              (_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE < *ptmp2_size));\n\n  if (required_size <= _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE)\n    return tmp1;\n\n  if (required_size <= *ptmp2_size)\n    return *ptmp2;\n\n  if (required_size > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE)\n    return NULL;\n  if (NULL != *ptmp2)\n    free (*ptmp2);\n  *ptmp2 = (char *) malloc (required_size);\n  if (NULL == *ptmp2)\n    *ptmp2_size = 0;\n  else\n    *ptmp2_size = required_size;\n  return *ptmp2;\n}\n...\nsize_t\nMHD_str_unquote (const char *quoted,\n                 size_t quoted_len,\n                 char *result)\n{\n  size_t r;\n  size_t w;\n\n  r = 0;\n  w = 0;\n\n  while (quoted_len > r)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[r])\n    {\n      ++r;\n      if (quoted_len == r)\n        return 0; /* Last backslash is not followed by char to unescape */\n    }\n    result[w++] = quoted[r++];\n  }\n  return w;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct for this function. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns how pointer types are declared (they should point to a const-qualified type when possible). In the snippet shown the function does not declare a new non-const pointer type \u2014 it receives a const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param. The member param->value.str is declared in the struct (apparently as char *), and if that member truly never needs to be used to modify the underlying characters then the struct definition could be changed to use const char * to satisfy Rule 8.13. However that potential issue would be with the struct's declaration, not with the get_unquoted_param_copy function itself. Within this function the pointer is only used for read-only operations and is passed to APIs that accept const char * or const void * (MHD_str_unquote takes const char *, memcpy's source is const void *), so there is no mismatch or unsafe use here. Therefore the report that get_unquoted_param_copy violates MISRA Rule 8.13 is not correct (any violation would be in the struct member declaration and only if that member can indeed be const-qualified across the whole codebase)."
