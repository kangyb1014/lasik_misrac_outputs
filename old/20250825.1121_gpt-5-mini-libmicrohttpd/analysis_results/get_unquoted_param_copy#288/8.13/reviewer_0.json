Thus the pointer is not const-qualified when it clearly can be \u2014 violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Fix: change the struct member to const char *str (or otherwise const-qualify the pointer target).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function get_unquoted_param_copy:\nstruct MHD_RqDAuthParam\n{\n  /**\n   * The string with length, NOT zero-terminated\n   */\n  struct _MHD_str_w_len value;\n  /**\n   * True if string must be \"unquoted\" before processing.\n   * This member is false if the string is used in DQUOTE marks, but no\n   * backslash-escape is used in the string.\n   */\n  bool quoted;\n}\n...\nstruct _MHD_mstr_w_len\n{\n  char *str;\n  size_t len;\n}\n...\nstatic char *\nget_buffer_for_size (char tmp1[_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE],\n                     char **ptmp2,\n                     size_t *ptmp2_size,\n                     size_t required_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || (NULL != *ptmp2));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL != *ptmp2) || (0 == *ptmp2_size));\n  mhd_assert ((0 == *ptmp2_size) || \\\n              (_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE < *ptmp2_size));\n\n  if (required_size <= _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE)\n    return tmp1;\n\n  if (required_size <= *ptmp2_size)\n    return *ptmp2;\n\n  if (required_size > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE)\n    return NULL;\n  if (NULL != *ptmp2)\n    free (*ptmp2);\n  *ptmp2 = (char *) malloc (required_size);\n  if (NULL == *ptmp2)\n    *ptmp2_size = 0;\n  else\n    *ptmp2_size = required_size;\n  return *ptmp2;\n}\n...\nsize_t\nMHD_str_unquote (const char *quoted,\n                 size_t quoted_len,\n                 char *result)\n{\n  size_t r;\n  size_t w;\n\n  r = 0;\n  w = 0;\n\n  while (quoted_len > r)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[r])\n    {\n      ++r;\n      if (quoted_len == r)\n        return 0; /* Last backslash is not followed by char to unescape */\n    }\n    result[w++] = quoted[r++];\n  }\n  return w;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should point to const-qualified types when they do not need to modify the pointed-to object. The code shown for get_unquoted_param_copy does not introduce a new non-const pointer that obviously could be const: it accepts a const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param, and only reads from param->value.str. If the member value.str in the struct definition is declared as char * (non-const), then any deficiency would be in that struct member declaration, not in this function body. Moreover, whether the struct member should be changed to const char * cannot be decided from this single function alone \u2014 the member might be modified elsewhere in the codebase, in which case making it const would be incorrect. Therefore the claim that get_unquoted_param_copy itself violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is not correct. If there is a violation, it would be in the declaration of the struct member (and only if that member is never used to modify the pointed data)."
