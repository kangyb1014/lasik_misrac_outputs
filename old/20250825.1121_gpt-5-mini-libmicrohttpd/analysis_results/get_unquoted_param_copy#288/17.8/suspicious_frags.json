  "explanation": "No function-parameter modifications of the parameters themselves were found. All assignments act on objects pointed to by pointer parameters (which the MISRA note allows):\n- unquoted->str and unquoted->len modify the object referenced by the pointer parameter unquoted, not the parameter itself.\n- *ptmp2 and *ptmp2_size are written in get_buffer_for_size, modifying the objects pointed to by ptmp2 and ptmp2_size (allowed), and get_buffer_for_size never reassigns the ptmp2 or ptmp2_size parameters themselves.\n- tmp1 is used as a buffer (and may be written via returned pointer) but the tmp1 parameter (the pointer) is not reassigned.\n- param is a const pointer to const data segments; no writes to param or its members occur.\n- MHD_str_unquote writes into the result buffer pointed to by its parameter, not into the pointer parameter itself.\nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
