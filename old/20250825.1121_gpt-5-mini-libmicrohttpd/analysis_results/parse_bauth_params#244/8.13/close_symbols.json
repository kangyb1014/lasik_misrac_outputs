  ],
  "explanation": "1) definition of struct MHD_RqBAuth: The function writes into pbauth->token68. To determine whether the assignment pbauth->token68.str = str + token68_start violates the MISRA requirement about const-qualified pointers we must know the exact declaration of MHD_RqBAuth (the member names and types).\n\n2) declaration/type of the token68 member (especially token68.str): The key question is whether token68.str is declared as const char * or as char *. If token68.str is non-const (char *), assigning a const char * (str) to it discards const qualification and can violate the MISRA rule. Knowing token68.len type is useful to confirm no hidden casts or typedefs affect interpretation.\n\n3) typedef/alias for MHD_RqBAuth if present: If MHD_RqBAuth is provided via a typedef or alias (rather than struct tag), the exact typedef declaration should be inspected to get the same information as (1). This ensures there is no indirection or macro that changes the expected member types."
