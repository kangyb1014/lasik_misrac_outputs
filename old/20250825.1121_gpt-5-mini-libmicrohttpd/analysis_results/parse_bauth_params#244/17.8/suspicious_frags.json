  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The function only reads the parameters (str, str_len, pbauth) and uses a local index variable (i) to traverse the input. There are no assignments to the parameter variables themselves (no statements like str = ..., str_len = ..., or pbauth = ...), and the only writes performed are to the object pointed to by pbauth (pbauth->token68.str and pbauth->token68.len), which is allowed by MISRA Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The const-qualified input buffer (str) is not written to. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of Rule 17.8."
