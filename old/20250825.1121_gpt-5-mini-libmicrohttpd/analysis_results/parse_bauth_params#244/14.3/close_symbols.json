  "explanation": "1) MHD_get_rq_bauth_params_: parse_bauth_params' controlling expressions depend on the runtime values of the parameters (str and str_len). To decide whether any of the while conditions can be invariant (constant true/false) we must know how parse_bauth_params is invoked (can str be NULL? is str_len computed from strlen or from caller-provided length, can str_len be 0 or a compile-time constant in the call site?). The caller's code and argument computation may establish invariance or guarantee variability, so the caller implementation is needed.  \n\n2) struct MHD_RqBAuth: pbauth is written into at the end of the function. To rule out subtle aliasing or side-effects that might affect the controlling expressions (for example if pbauth overlaps the memory pointed to by str or if writing into pbauth has observable effects that could influence loop conditions), the exact layout/type of MHD_RqBAuth (and its token68 member types) is required. This lets the analyzer determine whether stores to pbauth could affect the loop or whether any invariance assumptions are safe.  \n\n3) mhd_assert: The function calls mhd_assert (presumably a macro or function) which may expand to code that can alter control flow (abort/longjmp) or be a no-op in certain builds. To determine whether the assertions affect the controlling expressions' invariance (e.g. by eliminating unreachable paths or transforming loops in different build modes) the definition/behaviour of mhd_assert is required."
