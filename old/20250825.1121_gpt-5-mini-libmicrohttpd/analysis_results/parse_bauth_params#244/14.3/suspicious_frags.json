  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are compile-time invariant (constant) in the provided code that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. All control expressions depend on runtime values or memory contents and therefore are not invariant: \n\n- while (i < str_len && (' ' == str[i] || '\\t' == str[i])) depends on i, str_len and str[i].\n- while (i < str_len && ' ' != str[i] && '\\t' != str[i]) depends on i, str_len and str[i].\n- if (0 == str[i]) and if ((',' == str[i]) || (';' == str[i])) depend on str[i].\n- if (str_len > i), if (str_len != i) depend on runtime values of str_len and i.\n- In the additional code, checks such as if (connection->rq.bauth_tried), if (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED > connection->state), and if (NULL == bauth) similarly depend on runtime state.\n\nNote on mhd_assert: the macro is defined as ((void)0) so the mhd_assert (0 != token68_len); statement is removed at compile time; this is not a controlling expression and does not introduce an invariant loop or condition. If the intent was to enforce a runtime check, the empty macro might hide that, but this is not a Rule 14.3 invariant-expression issue.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that appear to violate Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions that are compile-time invariant). If you want, I can flag places where runtime bounds/validations could be strengthened (e.g., explicit check for zero-length token before using token pointers) but that would be a different MISRA rule scope."
