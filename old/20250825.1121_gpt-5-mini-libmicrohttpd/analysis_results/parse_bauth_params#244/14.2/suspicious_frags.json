  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 specifically applies to the structure and clauses of for loops (initialization, condition, iteration expressions and the single loop counter constraints). The code uses while loops (three occurrences that advance the index variable 'i'), but these are not subject to Rule 14.2. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 14.2 to investigate. \n\nAdditional notes justifying why other fragments need not be reported:\n- The only loop-like constructs are while loops that modify the local variable 'i'. Rule 14.2 concerns the three clauses of a for statement; it does not apply to while loops.\n- There are no for(...) constructs with initialization/condition/iteration clauses to analyze for multiple loop counters, side-effects in the condition, or modifications of the loop counter in the loop body as required by the rule.\n- Function calls inside the code (e.g., mhd_assert) do not create or convert any for statement structure that would fall under Rule 14.2.\n\nGiven the absence of any for statements, there are no suspicious fragments to flag for Rule 14.2."
