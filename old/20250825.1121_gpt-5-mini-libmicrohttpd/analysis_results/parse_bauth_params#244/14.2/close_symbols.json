The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. The MISRA requirement concerns the well\u2011formedness of for statements; parse_bauth_params contains no for statements (only while loops) and makes no function calls that would become part of a for\u2011loop body. The provided static call graph shows parse_bauth_params has no callees, so there are no external functions or loop bodies to inspect. (If a macro used in this function\u2014e.g. mhd_assert\u2014could expand into a for loop, its definition would need to be examined; however, as written there is no evidence that any such macro introduces a for statement.)"
