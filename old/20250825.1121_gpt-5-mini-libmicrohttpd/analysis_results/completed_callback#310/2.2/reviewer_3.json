  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement \u201c(void) connection;\u201d is an evaluated expression statement that performs no side\u2011effects; removing it does not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour. By the rule text (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), this is dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Only caveat: if reading the identifier had side effects \u2014 e.g. the object were volatile or the expression caused I/O \u2014 it would not be removable without effect; that is not the case here.)"
