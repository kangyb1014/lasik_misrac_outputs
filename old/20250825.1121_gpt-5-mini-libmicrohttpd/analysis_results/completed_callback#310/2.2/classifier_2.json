Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of completed_callback:\n```c\nstatic void\ncompleted_callback (void *cls,\n                    struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                    void **req_cls,\n                    enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)\n{\n  struct timeval *tv = *req_cls;\n  struct timeval tve;\n  uint64_t delta;\n  (void) cls;         /* Unused.

  "scenario": "The statement \"(void) cls;\" is an expression statement with no side effects that is executed solely to suppress a compiler warning. Its removal would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code according to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
