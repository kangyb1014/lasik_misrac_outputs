  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The three lines \u201c(void) cls;\u201d, \u201c(void) connection;\u201d and \u201c(void) toe;\u201d are deliberate, explicit uses of otherwise-unused parameters to suppress compiler warnings and to document that the absence of use is intentional. MISRA\u2019s dead\u2011code prohibition targets truly redundant operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; the cast\u2011to\u2011void idiom is a conventional and intended \u201cuse\u201d and is not considered dead code in practice. (Also, MISRA guidance accepts explicit parameter usage or compiler/annotation mechanisms to indicate intentionally unused parameters.) Therefore the claim that the single statement \u201c(void) toe;\u201d violates Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
