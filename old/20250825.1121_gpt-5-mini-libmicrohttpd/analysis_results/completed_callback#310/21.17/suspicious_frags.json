  "explanation": "No uses of any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in the provided code. The function completed_callback does not call memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn (or any other string.h routine), so there are no direct string-handling calls to inspect for out-of-bounds pointer accesses.\n\nThe only array access in the function is small_deltas[delta], but it is guarded by the conditional if (delta < SMALL) before indexing, which prevents out-of-bounds access of small_deltas (SMALL is the array size). Other calls (gettimeofday, fprintf, free) are not string.h functions and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. Consequently there are no code fragments that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
