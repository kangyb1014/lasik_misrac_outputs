  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for analyzing MISRA C rule about string.h usage:\n\n- SMALL\n  - The code indexes small_deltas with delta only when (delta < SMALL). To prove there is no out\u2011of\u2011bounds access you must know the value/definition of SMALL (and whether it is nonnegative). This is an array-bounds check relevant to pointer/index safety (even though not a string.h call).\n\n- small_deltas\n  - Required to determine the array\u2019s declared element type and its length. Verifying small_deltas[delta] does not access beyond the object requires the array definition (size) and element type.\n\n- struct timeval\n  - The function reads tv->tv_sec and tv->tv_usec and computes differences. You need the exact layout and types (signed/unsigned, widths) of timeval members to reason about the arithmetic, possible wrapping/underflow and whether any pointer dereference is valid. This is necessary to rule out indirect memory errors that might be misinterpreted as string/ buffer problems.\n\n- gettimeofday\n  - Prototype/semantics confirm that gettimeofday writes into the provided struct timeval and does not involve string.h functions. Knowing its behavior helps ensure no hidden string functions are invoked and that tve is properly initialised before use.\n\n- uint64_t\n  - The code casts to uint64_t and prints with PRIu64; you need the typedef/width to reason about the integer arithmetic and whether the casts/operations could overflow or produce unexpected indices (e.g. for small_deltas).\n\n- PRIu64\n  - The format macro used by fprintf; include it to check the format string construction and confirm there is no use of string.h routines to build or manipulate the format string at runtime.\n\n- fprintf\n  - The function is called with a format string. Include its declaration to confirm the call signature and to reason about whether any string handling functions from <string.h> are being used by the program code (they are not invoked here directly). Also ensures the format usage is safe (not a buffer/format vulnerability originating from string ops in this function).\n\n- stdout\n  - The stream passed to fprintf. Including stdout is useful to confirm standard I/O usage and to check whether any wrappers in the build might manipulate strings before printing (to rule out indirect use of string.h by program code).\n\n- free\n  - The code frees tv (the pointer held in *req_cls). Include free to confirm deallocation semantics and to ensure no hidden string operations are performed by program-level code involved in allocation/deallocation.\n\nNotes\n- The MISRA rule specifically targets use of functions from <string.h>. The target function contains no direct calls to those functions. The symbols above are the ones you must inspect to (a) prove there are no direct or indirect calls to <string.h> functions from this function, and (b) verify that the array access small_deltas[delta] is bounded and that the timeval arithmetic and casts cannot produce an out\u2011of\u2011range index. If you also want absolute certainty about library internals, you would need the implementations of the runtime/library functions (gettimeofday, fprintf, free), but those are typically out of scope for application-level MISRA checks."
