  "explanation": "To decide whether any part of completed_callback is compile\u2011time or otherwise provably unreachable you must know the following additional symbols/definitions:\n\n- SMALL: The if/else decision (if (delta < SMALL) ...) depends directly on the numeric value of SMALL. If SMALL is a compile\u2011time constant (for example 0 or 1) it can make one branch impossible for all possible delta values, which would be unreachable code. Knowing SMALL's value is required to conclude reachability.\n\n- small_deltas (declaration and size): The true branch indexes small_deltas[delta]. You must know the array's declared element type and its length to determine whether any delta value satisfying delta < SMALL is representable and valid as an index. If SMALL is greater than the array length the indexed code could be erroneous or effectively unreachable in safe/defined operation modes; conversely, if the array has length 0 the increment code is unreachable/invalid.\n\n- struct timeval (definition: types of tv_sec and tv_usec): The computation of delta uses tve.tv_sec - tv->tv_sec and tve.tv_usec - tv->tv_usec and casts to uint64_t. The signedness and width of tv_sec and tv_usec (time_t, suseconds_t) affect whether the subtraction can be negative / underflow and thus what numeric range delta can take. That range is needed to evaluate whether delta < SMALL can ever be true or always false.\n\n- the caller(s) that initialize *req_cls (the producer of the stored timeval): Whether tv can be NULL or guaranteed non\u2011NULL, and whether the stored timeval is always earlier than the current time (so delta is non\u2011negative and small) depends on how req_cls is set by calling code. To prove a branch unreachable across the program you must inspect the places that set *req_cls (allocation, initial gettimeofday) and any invariants they establish.\n\n(Other referenced symbols such as gettimeofday, free, fprintf, stdout, PRIu64 do not affect compile\u2011time reachability of the if/else branches and are not required for deciding MISRA unreachable\u2011code violations in this function.)"
