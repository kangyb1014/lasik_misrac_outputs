  "explanation": "You must examine the call targets invoked by completed_callback to determine if any of them (directly or transitively) call back to completed_callback. For each symbol:\n\n- gettimeofday: completed_callback calls gettimeofday(&tve,...). To prove no indirect recursion, the analyser must inspect gettimeofday's implementation/call graph to ensure it does not (directly or via other calls) invoke application callbacks that could call completed_callback.\n\n- fprintf: completed_callback calls fprintf(stdout,...). The analyser must inspect fprintf and its transitive callees (vfprintf, write, any I/O hooks) to ensure they cannot invoke application code that leads back to completed_callback (for example via custom stdio hooks or user-installed callbacks).\n\n- free: completed_callback calls free(tv). The analyser must inspect free and any replaceable/free-hook mechanisms in the environment (e.g., user-provided malloc/free wrappers, destructor hooks) to ensure they do not call back into completed_callback.\n\nNo other function calls or function-pointer dereferences appear in the target; data symbols (SMALL, small_deltas, stdout, PRIu64) are not relevant to detecting recursion unless they hide function pointers, which they do not here."
