  "explanation": "free \u2014 Need the C library prototype/semantics (stdlib.h) to establish that free(void*) deallocates the object pointed to but does not modify the pointer parameter in the caller. This shows that calling free(tv) does not violate the rule by changing the pointer parameter itself (req_cls). small_deltas \u2014 Declaration/type of this global (or external) array is required to confirm that small_deltas[delta]++ updates a global object and not any of the function parameters (i.e. ensure the ++ does not alias/back to a parameter). SMALL \u2014 The macro/constant that controls the branch; required to understand which side of the branch executes (and therefore which objects get modified). Knowing its value isn\u2019t needed for pointer-modification semantics, but its identity is necessary to reason about whether the small_deltas modification path is taken. struct timeval \u2014 Definition of the struct (members tv_sec, tv_usec and their types) is required to reason about the dereference *req_cls \u2192 tv and the subsequent member accesses and arithmetic, and to confirm that only the pointed-to object's contents (and its storage via free) are affected rather than any pointer parameter itself."
