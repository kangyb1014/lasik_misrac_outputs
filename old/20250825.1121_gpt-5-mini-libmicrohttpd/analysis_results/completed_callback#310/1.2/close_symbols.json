  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- SMALL: needed to determine its definition (macro/constant). If SMALL is defined via a compiler extension (e.g. calculated with compiler-specific builtins) that would violate the rule. Also influences which branch is taken.\n\n- small_deltas: need the array declaration/type/size to check whether its definition uses any language/compiler extensions (e.g. variable length arrays, non-standard attributes, or placement in special sections).\n\n- gettimeofday: this is a POSIX API, not part of ISO C. To decide if the code uses a language/implementation extension we must know whether gettimeofday is provided by the standard C library or comes from POSIX/implementation-specific headers on the build target.\n\n- struct timeval: definition (usually from <sys/time.h>) is needed because timeval is POSIX; inspecting its origin and definition shows whether a non\u2011ISO type/extension is used.\n\n- PRIu64: macro comes from <inttypes.h>. Its definition affects format strings (and may expand to implementation-specific format specifiers). Need to confirm it is a standard macro in the used C dialect and not a nonstandard extension.\n\n- uint64_t: fixed-width integer typedef (from <stdint.h>). Must verify whether uint64_t is available in the compilation mode or provided as an implementation extension.\n\n- 1000000LL (long long literal / LL suffix): the LL suffix denotes long long literal. Some compilers treat long long as a language extension pre\u2011C99. To report a violation you must know whether long long is a standard feature in the targeted language mode or an extension.\n\n- fprintf: standard C function, but include/definition needed to ensure no nonstandard replacement/attribute is used.\n\n- stdout: standard C symbol; include its definition to confirm it's the standard object and not a compiler/library-specific variant.\n\n- free: standard C library function; check its declaration to ensure no extension or nonstandard attribute is used.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection and enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode: these are from the libmicrohttpd (MHD) API. Their definitions must be checked for any compiler-specific extensions/attributes (calling conventions, __attribute__, nonstandard keywords) that would make the code rely on language extensions.\n\nIn short, these symbols (and their headers/definitions) determine whether the code relies on POSIX APIs (gettimeofday/timeval), C99 features (uint64_t, PRIu64, long long) or any project/library-specific/implementation-specific extensions (SMALL, small_deltas, MHD types). Inspecting their definitions is required to decide if the target function uses any compiler-documented language extensions."
