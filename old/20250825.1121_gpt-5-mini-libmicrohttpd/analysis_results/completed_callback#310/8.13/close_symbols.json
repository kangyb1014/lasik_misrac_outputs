  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for assessing the MISRA rule (\"a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\"): \n\n- Typedef for the request-completed callback (void **req_cls): The exact callback prototype and the intended semantics of the third parameter are required to know whether the library/user expects to modify *req_cls (write back a pointer or free it). If the API requires writable con_cls (void **), you cannot change it to point-to-const; conversely, if the API promises it will not be written, a const qualification might be possible.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: Knowing the connection type and the library's expectations about it (whether the callback is allowed to modify connection or treat it as read-only) is necessary to decide if the pointer parameter should be const-qualified.\n\n- enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode: The type of toe and how it is used by the API can affect whether that parameter should be const; it documents the API contract for the callback.\n\n- struct timeval: The concrete fields and mutability of the pointed-to object are required to determine if the function modifies the object pointed to by tv (it only reads fields here, but the object is freed). If the object were not freed or modified, it might be eligible for const qualification.\n\n- gettimeofday (prototype): Declares that gettimeofday writes into its first argument, showing this call does not attempt to modify *tv (it writes into tve). This helps establish whether the function itself modifies the object pointed to by tv (it does not), which is relevant for const qualification of tv when not considering free.\n\n- free (prototype): free takes a void * (non-const). Because completed_callback calls free(tv), the pointed-to object cannot be const-qualified without a cast (free cannot accept a const void * safely). This is a primary reason why the pointer to the timeval object cannot be declared to point to const-qualified type.\n\n- small_deltas (declaration and type): The expression small_deltas[delta]++ mutates memory reachable from the array; knowledge of the array's declaration (non-const vs const, element type, bounds) is needed to determine whether the code violates const-qualification rules for pointers used to access that storage or for the ownership/aliasing model.\n\n- SMALL (macro/constant): The comparison delta < SMALL influences whether small_deltas is written. Knowing SMALL's value/type can affect static-analysis decisions about whether an index might be out-of-range or whether branching makes a write occur; it helps determine whether the pointer to small_deltas (if passed elsewhere) could have been const.\n\n- uint64_t typedef (stdint.h): The delta variable and related operations use uint64_t; having the exact width/type helps a static checker reason about conversions, integer promotions, and whether any pointer qualification changes would affect uses (e.g., casts when calling free).\n\n- PRIu64 macro (inttypes.h): Used in fprintf format. While not directly about const pointers, the macro and inclusion of inttypes may be required to understand surrounding headers and linkage that declare other related symbols; include it so the analyzer has the same macro/type environment.\n\nIn short: to decide if any pointer in completed_callback could/should be const-qualified you must know the external API contract (callback prototype and MHD types), which pointers are mutated or freed (free prototype, struct timeval), and which other objects are mutated here (small_deltas, SMALL). These symbols give the ownership/mutability and API requirements that determine whether const qualification is permissible without changing program behavior or violating the library contract."
