  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: gettimeofday(&tve, NULL) operates on a local (modifiable) timeval and is unrelated to pointer const qualification; the local variable declaration 'struct timeval tve;' is a non-pointer object that is modified and therefore should not be const; arithmetic and casts used to compute 'delta' do not involve pointer-to-object qualification; indexing and increment of small_deltas (small_deltas[delta]++) modifies an array element (object mutation, not pointer qualification); fprintf(stdout, ...) passes the standard stream as an argument but does not indicate that any pointer parameter in this function should be const-qualified; free(tv) deallocates the object pointed to by tv \u2014 since the object is being freed (and thus not merely read), making that pointee const would be inappropriate. These items therefore do not need further inspection for whether pointers should be const-qualified under Rule 8.13."
