Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be declared as 'const void *cls' when possible to express that the function will not modify the pointed-to object. Therefore this is a violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is an encouragement to add const to pointer targets where practical, but it must be applied with regard to required interfaces. completed_callback is a callback implementing an external API (the libmicrohttpd callback prototype) whose parameter types are dictated by that API. You cannot change the parameter type to const void * without breaking the required function-pointer signature and losing type compatibility with the library. Given that the parameter must match the externally mandated prototype, leaving it as void * (and explicitly marking it unused with (void)cls) is appropriate. Thus the reported violation is not valid in this context."
