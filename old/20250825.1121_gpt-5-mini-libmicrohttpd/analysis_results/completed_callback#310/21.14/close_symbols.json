  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about memcmp-on-null-terminated-strings you must be able to see any direct or indirect use of memcmp (including via wrappers or macros) and any symbols/macros that could expand to or call memcmp from inside this translation unit or at call sites. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- memcmp: Primary symbol to search for; required to determine whether the forbidden API is used directly anywhere reachable from this function or via macros/wrappers.\n- fprintf: Called by completed_callback; could be a macro or wrapper in this project that in turn uses memcmp (or calls other project code that does). Need its definition to rule out indirect memcmp usage.\n- stdout: The stream used by fprintf \u2014 include its declaration/definition to ensure fprintf is the standard library version and not redefined.\n- gettimeofday: Called by completed_callback; include its declaration to ensure it is the standard call (and not a project wrapper that might use memcmp).\n- free: Called to free tv; include its declaration/definition because some projects replace/free-wrap memory functions \u2014 a wrapper might use memcmp indirectly.\n- SMALL: Macro/constant used in the decision; its definition must be checked in case it is computed via an expression or macro that hides string comparisons.\n- small_deltas: Global array updated by this function; include its definition/type to ensure any access uses no implicit string comparisons or overloaded behavior (e.g., via overloaded macros or instrumented accessors).\n- PRIu64: Format macro used in the fprintf format string; include its definition to ensure it is a simple format macro and not redefined to something that could trigger string comparison semantics.\n- struct timeval: Type used for tv/tve; include its definition so analysis can confirm no user-defined operators or macros involving timeval that call memcmp.\n- uint64_t: Integer type used for delta; include typedef to ensure no unexpected macro/typedef shenanigans.\n- MHD_Connection: Parameter type (unused) \u2014 include its definition to ensure it is not a macro or typedef hiding code that uses memcmp when inspected (defensive completeness).\n- MHD_RequestTerminationCode: Enum type (unused) \u2014 include its definition for the same defensive reason as MHD_Connection.\n- req_cls: The parameter whose pointee is used as tv; include its declaration/usage context (callers/where it was set) because the object stored in *req_cls may have been produced by code that used memcmp on strings (e.g., if req_cls actually points to a string in some paths).\n- tv, tve, delta: Local variables (names/types) included to allow the analyzer to trace data origins/aliases; in particular tv (the pointer) origin needs inspection to confirm it is not or does not alias a char* or string object that was compared with memcmp earlier.\n\nInclude the declarations/definitions (or the headers/mappings) of these symbols in the next-agent prompt so the analyzer can detect any direct or indirect use of memcmp, or any redefinitions/wrappers/macros that expand to memcmp when determining MISRA compliance."
