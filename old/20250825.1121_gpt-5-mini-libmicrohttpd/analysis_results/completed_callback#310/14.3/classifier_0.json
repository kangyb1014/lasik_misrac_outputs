  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression is 'delta < SMALL' which depends on the runtime variable 'delta', so it is not invariant. (A violation would occur if the condition were a compile-time constant e.g. 'if (1)' or if SMALL made the test always true/false.)"
