  "explanation": "SMALL: The controlling expression if (delta < SMALL) can only be judged invariant if SMALL is known (macro/constant value). If SMALL is a compile-time constant this could make the comparison effectively invariant; if it is variable/configurable it is not. small_deltas: Knowing the declaration (type, size) is needed to understand whether the delta < SMALL test is used in a way that implies invariance concerns (e.g. indexing) and whether any observed invariance would have consequences. gettimeofday: The computation of delta depends on gettimeofday returning the current time; the semantic guarantee that gettimeofday yields varying values (rather than a constant) is central to proving the comparison is not invariant. call-sites that set/clear *req_cls (request\u2011context initializers): The check if (NULL == tv) depends on whether the request-specific pointer (*req_cls) can legitimately be NULL or is always initialized to a non-NULL timeval. You must inspect the code that assigns *req_cls to decide if the NULL test is ever true or always false (invariant). callers that invoke completed_callback / MHD request lifecycle semantics: You need to know when and how completed_callback is called by the MHD library (frequency, whether the same req_cls value can be reused across calls, whether completed_callback can be invoked with the same tv every time) to decide if either controlling expression could evaluate to the same result on every invocation. struct timeval definition (types of tv_sec and tv_usec): To check whether the delta computation can be constant or overflow/underflow-prone you need the exact types/widths/signs of tv_sec and tv_usec; that affects the numeric result used in the controlling expression."
