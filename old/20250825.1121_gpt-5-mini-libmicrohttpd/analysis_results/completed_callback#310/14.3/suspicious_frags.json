  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 because they are not controlling expressions or are clearly non-invariant: - The (void) casts for cls, connection, and toe are not control expressions. - The call to gettimeofday and the arithmetic computing delta are ordinary expressions (not controlling) and involve runtime values, so they are not invariant. - The macro definition #define SMALL (1024*128) and the array declaration static unsigned int small_deltas[SMALL] are constant definitions/objects, not controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3. - The final free(tv); is not a control statement. The two if-statements listed in suspicious_frags are the only controlling expressions in this function and therefore warrant inspection for potential invariance or conformity with the rule."
