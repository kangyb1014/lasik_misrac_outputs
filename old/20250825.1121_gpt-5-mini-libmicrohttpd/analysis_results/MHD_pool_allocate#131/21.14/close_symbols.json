  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why it is needed to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings):\n\n- struct MemoryPool: shows types and sizes of members (pos, end, size, memory[]) so you can determine what pointer is returned, whether returned memory can contain a NUL terminator, and whether bounds checks allow treating returned region as a null-terminated string.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: this macro/function affects the allocation size (asize). Knowing its exact behavior is required to see whether the computed allocation includes space for a terminating NUL or can cause off-by-one/overflow situations that would make callers accidentally compare non-terminated memory with memcmp.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: similarly affects asize; its rounding or extra red-zone semantics could change whether returned buffers are sized for terminators or whether size==0 corner cases occur.\n\n- mhd_assert: to know whether assertions alter runtime behavior (e.g., abort in debug) or hide precondition violations; also to determine if the assertions guarantee invariants that prevent misuse (e.g., ensuring buffer not used as string) relevant to later memcmp calls.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY: this routine may modify memory metadata or contents (in some builds it could initialize or tag memory). You must know whether it writes any bytes (for example a NUL) or otherwise affects whether returned memory is a valid null-terminated string before callers call memcmp.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_: a direct caller of MHD_pool_allocate. To decide if memcmp is ever invoked on memory returned by MHD_pool_allocate you must inspect this caller for memcmp (or string-compare) usage and see how it treats the returned pointer and length.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_initial_state_: another direct caller; likewise must be inspected for any use of memcmp on buffers obtained from MHD_pool_allocate.\n\n- MHD_pool_try_alloc and MHD_pool_reallocate: these are allocation-related functions called by MHD_connection_alloc_memory_. Their semantics may differ (e.g., zero-initialization, reallocation behavior). To fully understand all code paths that produce buffers used by callers (and thus might later be compared with memcmp), their implementations are needed.\n\n- memcmp (standard library declaration or any project wrapper): to detect all uses and to check whether any calls perform comparisons on buffers that are documented/guaranteed to be null-terminated strings. You must examine occurrences of memcmp (or wrappers) in the callers (and their callees) to determine if they are being used to compare null-terminated strings, which would violate the MISRA rule.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and implementations) will allow the next agent to trace how buffers returned by MHD_pool_allocate are used and whether memcmp is ever applied to them as null-terminated strings."
