  "explanation": "For a correct dead-code (MISRA) analysis of MHD_pool_allocate we must know whether each statement/operation can be removed without changing program behaviour. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: the function manipulates pool->pos, pool->end, pool->size and accesses pool->memory. The exact types, sizes and semantics (signed/unsigned types, overflow behaviour, whether memory is flexible array) determine whether the pointer arithmetic and adjustments are meaningful or could be redundant/dead.\n\n- pool->memory (type/definition): needed to know the element type and layout so that taking &pool->memory[...], pointer arithmetic and potential out-of-bounds accesses have defined behaviour; it also affects whether the computed ret value has any side effects.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: this macro/function computes alignment of pool->pos and is used in asserts and asize computation. If it is a no-op or constant it could make checks/assignments redundant; its definition is needed to see if code paths are ever reachable or operations removable.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: defines asize from size. Its exact behaviour (rounding, red-zone value, whether it can return 0 or wrap) determines whether the early return checks are meaningful or always/never taken, and whether subsequent arithmetic is meaningful.\n\n- mhd_assert: assertions may be side-effecting (e.g. log/abort) or compiled out (no-op). To decide if the assert statements are dead code (executable but removable without effect) we must know their definition and whether NDEBUG or similar macros disable them.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY: often a sanitizer/valgrind hook that may be a no-op in production builds. If it has no effect, the call could be dead code; if it modifies program-visible state (e.g. affects sanitizer behaviour or timing), it is not dead. Definition required.\n\n- SIZE_MAX: the comment and overflow logic reference the SIZE_MAX boundary. Knowing its value (standard size_t max) and how ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE deals with near-SIZE_MAX values is necessary to judge whether the (0 == asize && 0 != size) branch can ever fire and whether that branch is redundant.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_: one of the static callers. To decide if the whole function (or specific branches) is dead we must examine caller logic to see if MHD_pool_allocate is ever invoked at runtime and how its return value is used.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_initial_state_: the other static caller. Same reason as above \u2014 reachability and use-sites determine whether removing MHD_pool_allocate (or parts of it) would affect program behaviour.\n\n- MHD_pool_try_alloc and MHD_pool_reallocate: these are alternate pool allocation routines called by the same caller(s). Their presence/behavior may mean MHD_pool_allocate is unused under certain compile-time/runtime conditions; their logic is needed to assess whether MHD_pool_allocate is effectively dead.\n\n- build-time macros controlling assertions/unpoisoning (e.g. NDEBUG, MEMORY_SANITIZER, VALGRIND macros): these configuration macros change whether mhd_assert and _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY expand to code or no-ops. They therefore determine whether calls in the function are executable and whether their removal would change behaviour.\n\nIncluding these symbols/definitions in the next agent's prompt will allow a precise determination of which operations in MHD_pool_allocate are truly dead (executable but removable without effect), and whether the entire function is unused (dead) given the callers and build-time configuration."
