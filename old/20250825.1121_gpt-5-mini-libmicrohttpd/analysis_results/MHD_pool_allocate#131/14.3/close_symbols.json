  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to decide if any controlling expression in MHD_pool_allocate is invariant under MISRA C rule:\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: The assertion pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos) uses this macro/function. To decide whether that controlling expression is effectively invariant (always true) we must know the exact semantics/expansion of ROUND_TO_ALIGN (alignment boundary, compile-time vs. run-time behavior).\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: asize is computed from size by this macro. The two if-controls that follow ((0 == asize) && (0 != size)) and (asize > pool->end - pool->pos) depend on its computation. We must know whether this macro can produce constant/invariant values (e.g. always zero for some sizes) or depends solely on the size parameter.\n\n- mhd_assert: The three assertions are controlling expressions. Whether they are present in the compiled code (and thus subject to MISRA analysis) depends on how mhd_assert is defined (no-op in release, or expands to runtime check/branch). Its expansion also determines whether the expressions are considered controlling expressions in the final control flow.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY: Although placed after allocation, if this macro expands to code with control flow or side effects it could influence whether earlier expressions are effectively invariant or whether the function semantics change. At minimum we need its definition to confirm it does not alter control-flow semantics relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\n- struct MemoryPool (definition): The expressions use pool->end, pool->pos, pool->size and pool->memory. Their types, ranges and any invariants (e.g. const qualification, alignment guarantees, or whether accesses have side effects) are necessary to determine whether expressions such as pool->end >= pool->pos, pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos, and pool->end - pool->pos are constant/invariant.\n\n- SIZE_MAX: The comment/overflow check references SIZE_MAX semantics. Knowing the value/definition is needed to reason about the overflow scenario that makes asize==0 while size!=0 and to determine if the (0==asize)&&(0!=size) test can ever be true (i.e. whether asize calculation can wrap to 0).\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_: This is a caller of MHD_pool_allocate. To determine whether the controlling expression if (from_end) inside MHD_pool_allocate can be treated as invariant in the system (e.g. caller always passes a constant), we must inspect the caller(s) to see how the from_end argument is derived/constant across call sites.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_initial_state_: Another caller of MHD_pool_allocate; same reason as above \u2014 needed to check whether from_end is effectively invariant at call sites.\n\n- MHD_pool_try_alloc and MHD_pool_reallocate: These pool-manipulation functions are invoked (by the callers) and may modify pool->pos, pool->end or impose alignment invariants. To decide if the assertions and comparisons involving pool fields are invariant (always true) we must see how other pool operations adjust those fields and whether they guarantee alignment/invariants before calling MHD_pool_allocate.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any of the controlling expressions in MHD_pool_allocate are invariant (and thus violate MISRA), you must know the macros' semantics (ROUND_*), the assert/annotation macros, the concrete MemoryPool layout and invariants, the value of SIZE_MAX for overflow reasoning, and the callers/other pool-manipulating functions that establish or change the pool fields or the from_end argument."
