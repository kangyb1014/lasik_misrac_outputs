  "explanation": "To decide whether any branch in MHD_pool_allocate is unreachable you must know not only the local code but the exact semantics and invariants provided by related symbols:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: MHD_pool_allocate reads and updates pool->end, pool->pos, pool->size and indexes pool->memory. You need the precise types and any documented invariants or initial values to tell whether conditions like pool->end >= pool->pos or pool->end - pool->pos can ever be zero or negative and whether accesses can occur.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN and ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: These determine how 'asize' is computed from 'size' (alignment, added red-zone, and overflow behavior). The check (0 == asize) && (0 != size) and the subsequent bounds tests depend directly on these macros' semantics (especially how they handle very large size values and overflow to 0).\n\n- mhd_assert and assertion configuration: The function contains several mhd_assert calls that establish preconditions. If mhd_assert is a no-op in some builds (e.g. disabled by NDEBUG or project flags), those assertions do not guarantee the preconditions at runtime. To determine reachability you must know whether those checks are enforced at runtime or compiled out.\n\n- SIZE_MAX: The overflow/zero check uses the property that very large size values may wrap; knowing SIZE_MAX semantics (and the platform's size_t width) is necessary to reason about possible 'size' values that make asize==0.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY: Although it does not affect control flow, it could be a macro or function with side effects that matter for reachability or for pruning branches in some builds (e.g. instrumentation builds). Include it to be certain it does not alter which code is executed.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ and MHD_connection_set_initial_state_: These are the direct callers. To prove that some branch of MHD_pool_allocate is unreachable in the whole program you need to inspect how these callers invoke MHD_pool_allocate (what 'pool', 'size', and 'from_end' values they pass and what invariants they guarantee beforehand).\n\n- MHD_pool_try_alloc and MHD_pool_reallocate: These are used by MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ before it may call MHD_pool_allocate; they can alter pool state or enforce invariants. To determine whether some branch in MHD_pool_allocate can be reached you must inspect these helpers for preconditions they establish or adjustments they make to pool fields.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the conditions tested in MHD_pool_allocate (the overflow/zero case, the asize > pool->end - pool->pos case, and the from_end branch) can ever evaluate to the tested values in any build configuration \u2014 which is necessary to decide if any of the branches are unreachable (MISRA rule about unreachable code)."
