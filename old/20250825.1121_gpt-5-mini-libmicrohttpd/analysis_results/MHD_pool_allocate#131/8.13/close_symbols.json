  "explanation": "- struct MemoryPool (full definition): You must know the exact type of pool->memory (e.g. char[], unsigned char[], void *, const-qualified type, volatile, etc.) and the types of pos/end/size. The const-qualification of the underlying storage determines whether returning a non-const void * discards const, and whether the allocation should be typed as const-qualified.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (full source): This caller receives the pointer returned by MHD_pool_allocate. To decide if the returned pointer can/should be const, we must see how that pointer is used (read-only or written). The caller may write into the buffer, pass it to writers, or store it in const-qualified locations.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_initial_state_ (full source): Same reason as above \u2014 it is a direct caller; its use of the returned pointer determines whether the pointer must be writable.\n\n- MHD_pool_try_alloc and MHD_pool_reallocate (definitions): These are related allocation routines used in the same allocation paths. Their declarations and usage of pool->memory help establish the intended mutability semantics of pool allocations and whether other APIs expect writable buffers.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (macro/function): Although instrumentation, its implementation may indicate whether the memory is intended to be written (e.g. it may be a no-op for const memory or assume writable memory). It also shows whether any casts are performed that affect qualifiers.\n\n- Call sites in the callers that receive the pointer (any functions the callers pass the pointer to that may modify memory, e.g. memcpy/memset/strcpy or project-specific writers): To determine whether the pointer can be const-qualified, we must find every location the returned pointer flows to; if any of those sites write into the buffer, the pointer cannot be const. Listing actual call targets used by the callers (and their signatures) is necessary to conclude compliance with the MISRA rule."
