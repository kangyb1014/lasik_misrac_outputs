  "explanation": "For checking whether MHD_pool_allocate permits or leads to out-of-bounds accesses by standard <string.h> functions, the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (full definition, including types of memory, and semantics of pos/end/size): to know the actual buffer base, element type (char/uint8_t/etc.), and the valid byte range (pool->memory[0 .. pool->size-1]) so any pointer returned (&pool->memory[pool->pos] or &pool->memory[pool->end - asize]) can be validated against object bounds.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN and ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: these compute asize from the requested size. Their exact implementation is required to determine whether asize can overflow, round up past pool bounds, or otherwise permit returning a pointer plus a usable region that is smaller/larger than callers expect (which could cause subsequent string.h calls to read/write out of bounds).\n\n- SIZE_MAX (limits.h): the code comments and check (0 == asize && 0 != size) are tied to size wrap/overflow behavior relative to SIZE_MAX. Knowing SIZE_MAX semantics is necessary to reason about when the function returns NULL vs returns a pointer for very large size values.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function): to know whether the asserted invariants (pool->end >= pool->pos, pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos, pos aligned) are enforced in builds of interest or compiled out; these preconditions affect whether pointer arithmetic can produce out-of-bounds pointers that later callers might use with string.h functions.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (macro/function): this helper may call sanitizer routines or memory-initialization functions (possibly using memset) or be a no-op. Its implementation is needed to determine if any string/memory functions are invoked here and whether they operate within correct bounds of the object.\n\n- MHD_pool_try_alloc and MHD_pool_reallocate: alternative pool allocation functions called by higher-level allocators. To assess overall allocation safety and how callers choose between these routines (and whether they expect different size guarantees), their semantics and bounds behavior must be known.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ and MHD_connection_set_initial_state_: immediate callers of MHD_pool_allocate. Their code must be inspected to see how they use the returned pointer and size (do they pass it to memcpy, strcpy, memset, strlen, etc., and with what length arguments). The MISRA rule is about string.h usage, so the callers' use of the allocated region is essential to determine if an out-of-bounds access happens.\n\n- MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_, try_ready_normal_body, parse_cookie_header, MHD_get_rq_bauth_params_, MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_, new_connection_process_: these are callers of the above callers (from the static call graph). Include them so the pointer-origin-to-use chain can be followed: any of these higher-level functions might invoke string.h routines on buffers obtained via MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ or MHD_connection_set_initial_state_. To be certain the rule is not violated, the full call chain where the returned pointer flows into string.h functions must be available.\n\nIn short: to prove or disprove MISRA violations you must know (1) exact buffer layout and bounds (struct MemoryPool), (2) how requested sizes are rounded/checked (ROUND_TO_ALIGN* and SIZE_MAX), (3) whether asserted invariants hold in the build (mhd_assert), (4) whether this function itself invokes any memory/string functions (_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY), and (5) how callers actually use the returned pointer (the listed allocation wrappers and higher-level callers)."
