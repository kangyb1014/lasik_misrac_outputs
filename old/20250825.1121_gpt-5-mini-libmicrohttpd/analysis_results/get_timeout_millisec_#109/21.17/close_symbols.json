  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed:\n\n- MHD_get_timeout64 (declaration and implementation): The target passes &d_timeout and the daemon pointer into MHD_get_timeout64. To determine whether any string.h functions are used on pointers supplied (and whether they could access out-of-bounds memory), you must inspect MHD_get_timeout64's code and its use of those pointer parameters.\n\n- MHD_DLOG (declaration and implementation): MHD_get_timeout64 calls MHD_DLOG according to the call graph. MHD_DLOG may itself call string handling routines or format/inspect buffers derived from the daemon or timeout pointer; its implementation must be checked for any unsafe string.h usage.\n\n- connection_get_wait (declaration and implementation): Also called by MHD_get_timeout64 per the call graph. Any string operations in this function (or how it treats pointers passed from the daemon or the timeout storage) could cause out-of-bounds accesses and must be examined.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (complete definition): The daemon pointer is forwarded into MHD_get_timeout64 and potentially into downstream calls. Fields of this struct (pointers to buffers, strings, etc.) might be used by callee functions with string.h routines; you need the structure layout to see what gets passed and how it could be indexed or passed to string functions.\n\n- MHD_NO (macro/enum): The target compares MHD_get_timeout64's return to MHD_NO. Knowing the exact value/type helps interpret return-paths in callers and whether particular code paths (that might use string functions) are taken.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function): The target calls mhd_assert; although unlikely to use string.h, the macro expansion or assertion handler could invoke logging/string routines. Include it to confirm it does not introduce string function usage that could touch user pointers.\n\n- INT64_MAX (limits.h) and stdint typedefs (uint64_t, int64_t, int32_t): Needed to reason about the integer casts, comparisons and whether the code converts or reinterprets pointer/size types in ways that could lead to passing incorrect sizes/addresses to string functions in the call chain. Having the exact type definitions and limit macros avoids mistaken assumptions when auditing callee code for buffer/sized accesses.\n\nNote: In practice the primary items to inspect are the full implementations of MHD_get_timeout64 and its callees (MHD_DLOG, connection_get_wait) plus the MHD_Daemon layout; the other symbols provide context for safe interpretation of code paths and types."
