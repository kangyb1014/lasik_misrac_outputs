  "explanation": "I did not identify any other pointer usages in this function that could be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The remaining code consists of integer variables, integer casts, comparisons, return statements and the mhd_assert macro invocation; none of these introduce pointers or pointer types that could/should be const-qualified. Therefore only the pointer occurrences listed above need investigation for whether they could or should point to const-qualified types."
