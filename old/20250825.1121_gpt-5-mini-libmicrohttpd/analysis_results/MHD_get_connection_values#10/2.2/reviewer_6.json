  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The alleged \u2018\u2018dead code\u2019\u2019 statements ((void) method; etc.) do not appear in the reported target function MHD_get_connection_values \u2014 they are in the separate answer_to_connection helper shown in the additional code. More importantly, MISRA Rule 2.2 targets code whose execution could be removed with no effect on program behaviour. The \u2018\u2018(void) param;\u2019\u2019 idiom is a deliberate, portable no\u2011op used to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although removal of such a statement normally does not change runtime behaviour, this idiom is a recognized practice to document unused parameters; MISRA compliance interpretations treat it as the appropriate way to indicate an unused parameter (i.e. addressing a different concern: unused entities), not as an instance of dead code falling under Rule 2.2. Therefore Agent A\u2019s claim that Rule 2.2 is violated is not correct for the provided code."
