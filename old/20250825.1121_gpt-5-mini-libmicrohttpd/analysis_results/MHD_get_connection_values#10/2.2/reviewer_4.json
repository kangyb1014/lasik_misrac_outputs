  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. First, the target function MHD_get_connection_values shown does not contain any '(void) cls;' statement \u2014 the agent has confused that function with the separate answer_to_connection example in the additional code. Second, even if those (void)param; lines appear (as in answer_to_connection), they are the conventional idiom to mark a parameter as intentionally unused and only influence compiler diagnostics; they do not change program behaviour. MISRA Rule 2.2 concerns executed operations whose removal would not affect observable program behaviour; while the cast-to-void has no runtime effect, it is used purposely to document/avoid warnings and is not the sort of accidental dead code the rule is intended to prohibit. Therefore the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
