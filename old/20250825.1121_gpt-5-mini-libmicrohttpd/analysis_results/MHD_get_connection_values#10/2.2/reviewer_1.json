It reads the parameter value (no side effects) and doing so has no effect on program behaviour; therefore removing that statement would not change program behaviour. As a reachable, effectless operation it constitutes dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If the parameter were volatile or otherwise had observable side effects when read, the conclusion could differ.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_connection_values:\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nanswer_to_connection (void *cls,\n                      struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                      const char *url,\n                      const char *method,\n                      const char *version,\n                      const char *upload_data,\n                      size_t *upload_data_size,\n                      void **req_cls)\n{\n  const char *page = \"<html><body>Hello timeout!</body></html>\";\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  (void) cls;               /* Unused.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as applied to the shown MHD_get_connection_values function. The MHD_get_connection_values implementation contains no \"(void) upload_data_size;\" or other similar no-op expression statements; every statement in that function affects the return value or the iterator call, so removing them would change behaviour. Therefore that function does not violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nThat said, in the additional answer_to_connection code the lines like \"(void) upload_data_size;\" are reachable, effectless expression statements whose removal would not change program behaviour (unless the parameter were volatile or reading it had observable side effects). Under a strict reading of Rule 2.2 those specific (void) casts would qualify as dead code. In practice such idioms are commonly used to silence unused-parameter warnings and are often handled by project coding rules or accepted deviations, but the original report misattributes the issue to MHD_get_connection_values, so the report is incorrect."
