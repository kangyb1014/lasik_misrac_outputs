  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void)req_cls; statement is the standard, intentional idiom to mark a parameter as unused and to suppress compiler warnings for a callback that must match a given signature. Although the cast expression has no runtime side effects and removing it would not change program behavior, MISRA\u2019s intent with Rule 2.2 is to forbid truly superfluous code that ought to be removed; in practice the explicit void-cast to document an unused parameter is an accepted and documented way to handle required but unused parameters (and is functionally required to avoid warnings or to keep the required prototype). In short, this use is a deliberate, documented no-op and is not treated as a Rule 2.2 violation in normal MISRA practice (and can be justified as required by the callback signature)."
