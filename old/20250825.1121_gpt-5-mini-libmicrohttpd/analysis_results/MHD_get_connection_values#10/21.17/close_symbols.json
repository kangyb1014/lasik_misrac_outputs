  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_connection_values can cause out-of-bounds accesses with string.h functions you must know exactly what pointer objects it exposes and how they are interpreted by any code that may call string.h on them. The function itself does not call memcpy/strlen/strcpy etc., but it passes pos->header and pos->value to an external iterator callback. Therefore you need:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection and the definition of connection->rq so you can find where headers_received comes from and whether those buffers are owned/allocated/valid for string operations.\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header and the concrete types of its fields (kind, header, value, next) to know whether header/value are C strings (NUL-terminated char*) or some other representation (pointer+length, encoded buffer), which affects whether string.h calls would be safe.\n- enum MHD_ValueKind to interpret the bitmask test (pos->kind & kind) and ensure no implicit conversion or masking could affect pointer fields.\n- The MHD_KeyValueIterator typedef (prototype) so you know what types are passed to the iterator (e.g. are header/value passed as const char*, as (char*, size_t), or some other form) and what the iterator is permitted to do with them.\n- The MHD_NO constant so you know the callback stopping convention and how early returns affect use/lifetime of the pointers.\n- The actual iterator implementations (or the call sites that supply iterators, such as answer_to_connection) and their source or specification \u2014 because violations of <string.h> bounds would occur inside those iterator implementations when they operate on header/value. To conclude the target function is safe you must verify what iterator(s) receive these pointers and whether they call string.h functions on them.\n- Any documentation/contract for the iterator/API that describes lifetime and NUL-termination guarantees for header/value (whether the callee can assume strings are NUL-terminated and how long the buffers remain valid). This is necessary to judge whether subsequent string.h usage is within bounds.\n\nWith these symbols and contracts you can determine (1) whether header/value are the kinds of objects that string.h functions may be applied to, (2) whether their lengths/lifetimes are sufficient for such uses, and (3) whether any iterator implementations actually call string.h in a way that could read/write beyond the buffers passed."
