  "explanation": "There are no direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in this function. The only location that could lead to string-library accesses is the invocation of the user-supplied iterator with pos->header and pos->value; the iterator implementation must be inspected to ensure any string.h usage does not access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by those pointers. All other fragments (the null check on connection, the loop over connection->rq.headers_received, the pos->kind bitmask test, counter increment and returns) perform no string-library operations and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
