  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler/language extensions you must inspect the declarations/macros/types it relies on, because extensions are commonly introduced there. For each symbol:  \n\n- _MHD_EXTERN: This is a macro appearing in the function declaration; it may expand to compiler-specific storage-class or attribute annotations (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, visibility, calling-convention or linkage extensions). Inspect its definition for any non\u2011standard keywords or attributes.  \n\n- MHD_KeyValueIterator: This typedef is the function\u2011pointer type invoked as iterator(...). Its definition may include compiler-specific calling conventions, attributes, varargs, or non\u2011standard prototype extensions \u2014 all relevant to MISRA's ban on language extensions.  \n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: The enum type used with bitwise & must be checked to ensure it is a plain standard enum (not defined via extension, nor using extended integer types or attributes). Also check whether any enum constants or macros used here use extension syntax.  \n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The structure type is dereferenced in the function (connection->rq). Its definition may contain non\u2011standard features (anonymous structs/unions, bit\u2011fields with implementation\u2011specific sizes, designated initializers in declarations, or extension attributes). You must inspect it to find any language extensions used in its declaration.  \n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop variable pos is this type and its fields (kind, header, value, next) are accessed. The struct definition could contain anonymous/unnamed members, GCC extensions, attributes, or non\u2011standard field types; inspect for extension usage.  \n\n- MHD_NO: The code compares the iterator return against MHD_NO. This macro/enum constant could be defined using non\u2011standard constructs or be an alias for an expression that uses compiler extensions; inspect its definition.  \n\nInspecting these symbols (their typedefs, macros, and struct/enum definitions) is sufficient to detect any explicit compiler language extensions used directly by the target function. Only these are required to judge MISRA rule compliance for language extensions in the function; other listed callers/callees are not needed unless their declarations appear in the above symbols."
