  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions in MHD_get_timeout64 that are syntactically invariant (constant) and therefore in potential breach of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. All conditional and loop controlling expressions depend on runtime state or structure members or on macros that expand to runtime expressions: \n\n- if (MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ (daemon)) \u2014 the macro expands to (0 != ((daemon)->options & MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION)) so it depends on daemon->options (runtime).\n- if (daemon->data_already_pending || (NULL != daemon->cleanup_head) || daemon->resuming || daemon->have_new || daemon->shutdown) \u2014 each operand is a run\u2011time field.\n- #ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT block: if (MHD_D_IS_USING_EPOLL_ (daemon) && ((NULL != daemon->eready_head) ...)) \u2014 MHD_D_IS_USING_EPOLL_ depends on daemon->options and daemon->eready_head is a runtime pointer; the optional UPGRADE_SUPPORT/HTTPS_SUPPORT branch is controlled by preprocessor but any remaining operands are runtime.\n- if ((NULL != pos) && (0 != pos->connection_timeout_ms)) and subsequent if (0 != pos->connection_timeout_ms) and the comparison inside the nested if \u2014 all use structure members (pos->connection_timeout_ms, pos->last_activity) that are dynamic.\n- for (pos = daemon->manual_timeout_tail; NULL != pos; pos = pos->prevX) \u2014 the loop control checks a runtime pointer and advances it at each iteration; it is not a compile-time constant.\n- if (NULL != earliest_tmot_conn) \u2014 runtime pointer check.\n\nNote also: mhd_assert is defined as ((void)0) so the assertion call compiles to nothing; its argument is not a controlling expression in the compiled code.\n\nBecause each controlling expression uses runtime data or macros that expand to runtime-dependent expressions, there are no invariant controlling expressions to report. If you want, I can re-check under specific build configurations (e.g., particular preprocessor symbols defined or if daemon->options is known to be a constant) \u2014 such configurations could potentially make some controlling expressions constant and would then be worth investigating."
