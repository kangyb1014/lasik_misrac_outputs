  "explanation": "I found no instances where a function parameter variable is assigned to or otherwise modified. In MHD_get_timeout64 the pointer parameters are 'daemon' and 'timeout64': there are no assignments to 'daemon' or to the pointer variable 'timeout64' (only writes to *timeout64 occur, which is explicitly allowed by the rule). All uses of 'daemon' are reads of its members (daemon->...) or passing it to other functions/macros; the macros shown expand to boolean/member-access expressions and do not reassign the parameter. The helper connection_get_wait takes parameter 'c' but only reads c-> members and does not modify the pointer parameter. MHD_DLOG and other functions/macros either take the daemon pointer as const or only use it to call callbacks; even if the pointed-to object were modified inside those callees, that is permitted by the rule. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
