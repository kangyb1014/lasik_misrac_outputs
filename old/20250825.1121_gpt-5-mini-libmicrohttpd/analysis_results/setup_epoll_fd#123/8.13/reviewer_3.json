According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be to a const-qualified type when possible \u2014 e.g. 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon'.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim is incomplete and therefore not demonstrably correct as stated. Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer parameter be to a const-qualified type when that is possible, and on first glance setup_epoll_fd\u2019s daemon parameter is never modified inside the function \u2014 it is only used in a logging macro (or cast to void). If you can change the function\u2019s API and all call sites (in particular the MHD_DLOG macro and any functions it expands to) so that they accept a const struct MHD_Daemon * then changing the parameter to const struct MHD_Daemon * would satisfy 8.13.\n\nHowever, if the logging macro/function (or other call sites) requires a non-const pointer, or if the parameter is part of a public API that must remain non-const for compatibility, then it is not \u201cpossible\u201d to make it const without other changes \u2014 in that case the current code is acceptable and does not constitute a violation in context. The report did not show the signature/usage of MHD_DLOG or the wider API constraints, so you cannot conclusively say the rule is violated just from the snippet.\n\nRecommendation: inspect the declaration of MHD_DLOG/MHD_Daemon-related APIs. If they accept a const pointer (or can be changed), make the parameter const; otherwise document the justification (API compatibility or propagation to callers) to avoid a spurious 8.13 finding."
