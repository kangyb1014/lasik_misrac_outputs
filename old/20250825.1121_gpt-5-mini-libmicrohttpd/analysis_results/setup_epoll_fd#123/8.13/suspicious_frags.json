  "explanation": "Only the parameter 'daemon' is a pointer in this function; it is declared as 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' and is used (or explicitly unused) in the shown fragments. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-returning expressions in the function (fd is an int, calls to epoll_create/epoll_create1 return int, macro usages do not introduce pointer variables here). Therefore only the declaration and uses of the 'daemon' parameter need investigation for compliance with Rule 8.13 (i.e., whether it should be a pointer to a const-qualified type). No other fragments in this function contain pointers that would be relevant to Rule 8.13."
