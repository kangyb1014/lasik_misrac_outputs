  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- The function uses no loops (for, while, do-while) whose controlling expression could be invariant. The only control statements are if statements whose conditions depend on run-time values:\n  - fd is assigned by epoll_create1/epoll_create and then compared to MHD_INVALID_SOCKET; fd is not a compile-time constant.\n  - The call to MHD_socket_noninheritable_(fd) returns a run-time result (depends on fcntl/SetHandleInformation) and is used in an if; the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- Inside MHD_socket_noninheritable_, the controlling expressions depend on the result of fcntl or SetHandleInformation (run-time values), e.g. if (-1 == flags) and the subsequent checks involving flags; these are not invariant.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #if defined / #endif) are compile-time directives and not C controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3.\n- The expression return ! 0; is not a controlling expression; it is a constant return value but does not violate Rule 14.3.\n\nGiven the above, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
