  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided compress_buf function. Specifically, the code does not contain any of the common compiler-specific extensions that would trigger Rule 1.2 checks, such as: __attribute__ or __declspec, __asm or inline assembly, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) (GCC extension), nested functions, labels as values, zero-length arrays, VLAs beyond standard C, or other non-standard keywords. The identifier types that might look non-standard (uInt, Bytef) are zlib typedefs/macros from library headers, not compiler language extensions. All casts, pointer arithmetic, standard library calls (realloc, free, memcpy) and control structures used are standard C. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for use of documented compiler language extensions."
