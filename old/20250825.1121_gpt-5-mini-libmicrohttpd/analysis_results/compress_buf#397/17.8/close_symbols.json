  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified (pointer objects may be modified but pointer variables themselves shall not):\n\n- z_stream (definition) and its members (avail_in, next_in, avail_out, next_out): needed to determine that statements like 'strm->avail_in = \u2026' and 'strm->next_in = \u2026' modify the object pointed to by the pointer parameter 'strm' (permitted) rather than reassigning the parameter 'strm' itself (prohibited).\n\n- CHUNK: macro constant used in comparisons/assignments and to compute 'have' and to update src_size; required to ensure those operations are simple value assignments/subtractions and not macro expansions that could reassign a parameter variable in another way.\n\n- uInt, Bytef: types used in casts/assignments to z_stream members (next_in/next_out). Their definitions confirm these are member-type conversions and do not indicate reassignment of pointer parameters themselves.\n\n- deflate (function prototype) and constants Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_OK: needed to confirm deflate is called with the z_stream pointer and to verify that any side effects are on the z_stream object (via the pointer) or return codes \u2014 i.e., deflate does not modify local parameter variables such as src_size, dest, etc., by reference.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and values MHD_YES / MHD_NO: to understand the return value logic (does not affect parameter modification) and ensure no hidden macro side effects.\n\n- realloc, free, memcpy (prototypes): these functions operate on the objects pointed to by pointer parameters (e.g., *dest) and return values; their prototypes show they do not modify the pointer parameter variables of compress_buf (only the pointed-to objects), so assignments like 'tmp_dest = realloc(*dest, ...)' and '*dest = tmp_dest' are modifications of the pointee (allowed) not of the parameter 'dest' itself.\n\n- uint8_t and size_t: standard types used in casts and parameter types; included to confirm the semantics of pointer arithmetic and that casts/arithmetics do not reassign parameter variables implicitly.\n\nNote: The above symbols are sufficient to determine whether the code modifies parameter variables themselves (e.g., src_size is modified by 'src_size -= CHUNK' \u2014 a violation because src_size is a value parameter) versus modifying objects pointed to by pointer parameters (e.g., *dest, *dest_size, *offset, members of *strm), which are allowed by the rule."
