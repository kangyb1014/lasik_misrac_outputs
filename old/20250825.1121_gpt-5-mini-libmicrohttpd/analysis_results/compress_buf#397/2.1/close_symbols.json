  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is needed to decide whether any statements or branches in compress_buf are impossible to reach (MISRA: no unreachable code):\n\n- CHUNK: the value of this macro controls loop iteration counts and the conditions (src_size > CHUNK, strm->avail_out = CHUNK, have = CHUNK - avail_out). If CHUNK has special values (e.g., 0) some loops/branches may become impossible or infinite.\n\n- z_stream: definition of this type (fields avail_in, avail_out, next_in, next_out and their types) is required to reason about assignments to strm->avail_in/avail_out/next_in/next_out and whether subsequent conditions (e.g., while (0 == strm->avail_out)) can be true or false.\n\n- deflate: prototype and semantic behaviour (how it updates strm->avail_out/avail_in, whether it can return values other than Z_OK) are required to determine whether the inner loop body executes, whether ret is set, and whether loops can terminate.\n\n- Z_OK, Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH: these constants control return comparison and loop termination. In particular Z_SYNC_FLUSH vs Z_NO_FLUSH determines the outer do/while termination condition; knowing their semantics/possible values is necessary to know whether the outer loop can exit.\n\n- uInt, Bytef: typedefs used for cast/assignment (strm->avail_in cast to (uInt) and next_in cast to (const Bytef *)) \u2014 needed to reason about possible truncation/representation issues that could affect control-flow conditions.\n\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: definition of the return type and enumerators is needed to determine the set of possible return values and whether the final return ret; or early return (on realloc failure) are reachable.\n\n- read_cb: the caller of compress_buf. To decide if some branches are unreachable due to caller-supplied invariants (e.g., always-zero src_size, always non-NULL tmp, or other constraints), the caller's code must be inspected.\n\n- realloc, free, memcpy: their behaviours affect control flow inside compress_buf (realloc can fail causing an early return; knowledge that realloc may return non-NULL is needed to mark the subsequent memcpy path as reachable). Standard-library semantics are needed for a sound reachability analysis.\n\n- uint8_t, size_t: fundamental types used in pointer arithmetic and sizes; their ranges affect overflow/underflow reasoning and reachability of branches that depend on size arithmetic.\n\nCollectively, these symbols allow an analyzer to determine whether the if/else branches, the inner and outer loops, the early return on allocation failure, and the final return are potentially executable under any valid definitions/uses. Without them reachability judgments would be unsound."
