The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "For each symbol below I explain why it is required to determine whether compress_buf can violate the MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops. The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of any called function as part of a for\u2011loop body, and forbids modification of loop counters/objects used in the loop clauses by the loop body (including called functions). Even though compress_buf contains no for statement, to conclude that definitively and to check whether any called function could affect a hypothetical for counter or loop\u2011control objects you must inspect the following symbols:\n\n- deflate (prototype/semantics): Called inside the inner loop. You need its prototype and specification to know what side effects it has on the z_stream object (members like avail_out/avail_in/next_*), global state, or other objects. If a for loop existed and used any of those objects in its clauses, deflate\u2019s side effects would be relevant to MISRA's restriction on modifications.\n\n- realloc (prototype/semantics): Called to resize *dest. realloc can free/allocate memory and change the pointer value. If a for loop clause used the pointer or memory it points to, realloc\u2019s side effects would matter for the rule.\n\n- free (prototype/semantics): Called on failure to free previously allocated memory. free\u2019s side effects on heap objects and pointer validity are relevant for determining whether objects used in loop clauses could be modified by the loop body.\n\n- memcpy (prototype/semantics): Copies into *dest. memcpy modifies memory pointed to by *dest; if a loop clause depended on that memory or an object that memcpy changes, this would be relevant.\n\n- z_stream (struct definition) and Bytef/uInt typedefs: The function manipulates members of the z_stream (avail_in, avail_out, next_in, next_out). You must know the exact member names/types and whether they alias other objects or have non\u2011obvious side effects to judge whether any of those objects could act as a loop counter or be modified by called functions.\n\n- CHUNK (macro): The code uses CHUNK as the unit of I/O and to compute have and avail_* values. Its value can affect loop iteration counts and termination conditions (e.g., whether inner loop iterates), so it is needed to reason about any loop counters derived from these calculations.\n\n- Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_OK (zlib constants): These constants drive the flush variable and the outer do/while termination (flush != Z_SYNC_FLUSH). If a for loop condition or counter were derived from these values or from results of deflate, you must know their meaning and values to check for illegal modifications.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and MHD_YES/MHD_NO (definitions): ret is set based on deflate\u2019s return. Knowing these definitions is necessary to determine whether ret or its underlying objects could be used as loop control flags or counters elsewhere in code that might create a for\u2011loop MISRA violation.\n\n- uint8_t, size_t (standard typedefs): Standard size/type definitions used in pointer arithmetic and memcpy. Type widths and signedness matter when reasoning about loop counters, pointer arithmetic and whether operations in clauses have side effects or undefined behaviour.\n\nNotes: compress_buf itself contains no for statement; it uses do/while loops. To prove the function does not violate the MISRA for\u2011loop rule you must (a) inspect its body and confirm no for loops exist and (b) if there were for loops that call any of the above functions, you must know the side effects of those functions and the representations of the involved objects. The symbols listed are the minimal external definitions required to perform that analysis precisely."
