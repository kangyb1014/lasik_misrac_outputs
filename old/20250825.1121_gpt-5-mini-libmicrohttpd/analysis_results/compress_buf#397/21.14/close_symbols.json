  "explanation": "To determine whether compress_buf violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the next analysis needs the following symbols:\n\n- memcmp: Directly relevant symbol \u2014 must be checked to ensure it is not used in this function (or hidden via macros/wrappers). If memcmp is referenced (directly or via macro), its use must be inspected to see if it compares null-terminated strings.\n\n- memcpy: compress_buf calls memcpy. Include its symbol to distinguish correct use of memcpy from any accidental use of memcmp (e.g., mis-typed or macro-shaded identifiers) and to ensure no string-comparison uses are done via memcpy.\n\n- deflate: compress_buf calls deflate. Even though deflate is an external/library call, include it so the analyzer can confirm that this call is not a macro or inline wrapper that expands to or invokes memcmp in the caller context (and to reason about whether string comparisons could be hidden there).\n\n- realloc, free: These allocation functions are called; include them to check for macros or wrappers that might internally expand to or alias memcmp (rare but relevant for thorough static analysis of symbol resolutions).\n\n- z_stream, uInt, Bytef: Types used by the zlib API in the function. Include to resolve any macros/type aliases that could hide calls to memcmp or change semantics of pointer/byte handling relevant to string comparison checks.\n\n- CHUNK, Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_OK: Macros/constants used by compress_buf. Include to allow full preprocessing/resolution of the function body (ensuring no macro tricks convert code into memcmp-based string comparisons).\n\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: Return-value symbols used by compress_buf. Include to confirm no macros or inline expansions hide memcmp usage through those symbols.\n\nIn short, include memcmp plus all functions, macros, and types referenced by compress_buf so the analyzer can (1) verify no direct memcmp call exists, (2) ensure no indirect or macro-aliased memcmp usage is hidden in called/expanded symbols, and (3) confirm that byte-copy operations (memcpy) are not being confused with string comparisons."
