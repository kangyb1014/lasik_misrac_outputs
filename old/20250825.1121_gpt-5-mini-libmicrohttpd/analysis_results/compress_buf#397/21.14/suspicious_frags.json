  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function compress_buf uses memcpy, realloc, free and deflate, and operates on raw buffers with explicit sizes (src_size, have, CHUNK) rather than null-terminated strings. The src parameter is a void pointer with an explicit src_size and is never treated as a C string. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings)."
