  "explanation": "read_cb: the immediate caller of compress_buf (per the call graph). You must inspect read_cb to see whether there is any transitive call path from compress_buf back to read_cb (i.e. an indirect recursion cycle).\n\ndeflate: compress_buf directly calls deflate. To rule out indirect recursion you must know whether deflate (or any code it invokes) can call back into program code that may eventually call compress_buf.\n\nrealloc, free, memcpy: standard library calls made by compress_buf. Although usually library functions do not call back into application functions, project-specific wrappers or replacements can; include them so their implementations can be checked for callbacks to compress_buf (directly or via other application functions).\n\nz_stream->zalloc, z_stream->zfree: zlib's deflate may invoke the allocator/free callbacks stored in the z_stream structure. Those callbacks can be user-defined functions in the same program and could form an indirect call path back to compress_buf; their definitions (or that they are NULL/default) must be known.\n\nNote: CHUNK, Z_* macros and type definitions (uInt, Bytef, z_stream) are not required to decide whether compress_buf participates in a recursion cycle, but the above function symbols (and any functions called transitively by them) must be examined to conclusively determine whether compress_buf is directly or indirectly self-calling."
