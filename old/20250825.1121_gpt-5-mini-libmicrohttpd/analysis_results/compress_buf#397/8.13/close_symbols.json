  "explanation": "For analyzing const-qualification issues in compress_buf you must know the declarations/types and prototypes that determine whether pointers should be const:\n\n- z_stream: needed to inspect the types of its members (next_in, next_out, avail_in, avail_out). The const-qualification (e.g. next_in declared as const Bytef *) directly affects whether assigning from src (const void *) is consistent and whether next_out should be const.\n\n- Bytef: typedef used by z_stream and deflate; its underlying type (e.g. unsigned char) matters for pointer constness and casts.\n\n- uInt: typedef used for avail_in/avail_out; required to understand implicit conversions and whether CHUNK/size_t usage changes const expectations.\n\n- deflate: prototype (parameter types and whether it mutates the buffers) is required to know whether next_in/next_out must be const or non-const and whether passing tmp (as next_out) or src (as next_in) respects const.\n\n- Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_OK: zlib macros used with deflate and return comparisons \u2014 need their meanings/signatures to see how deflate is invoked and whether any pointer is passed to a function that requires non-const.\n\n- CHUNK: macro/type used to set avail_in/avail_out and compute have; its type influences casts/conversions and whether signed/unsigned conversions force use of particular pointer types.\n\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: the function maps deflate result to MHD_Result; the enum definition isn't directly about constness but is needed to ensure return-value mappings do not hide misuse of pointer qualifiers (and to know whether any macro expansion changes pointer usage).\n\n- memcpy: prototype indicates second parameter is const void * (source). compress_buf passes tmp to memcpy as the source; knowing memcpy's signature lets you decide whether tmp could/should be const (i.e. tmp is used as source so it could be declared const void *).\n\n- realloc, free: prototypes and semantics are required to verify how dest is allocated/freed and whether pointer-to-pointer (void **) usage requires const qualifiers (e.g. whether dest should be void * const * or const void **). realloc's signature also establishes which pointer types are acceptable without casts.\n\n- uint8_t: used for pointer arithmetic/casts on *dest; knowing its typedef is needed to judge constness when casting between uint8_t * and void *.\n\n- size_t: used throughout for sizes/offsets; knowing its typedef ensures correctness of pointer arithmetic and casts that might affect const qualification.\n\nTogether these symbols let you determine where pointers are legitimately modifiable (must be non-const) vs. where they are only read (and thus could/should be const) so you can check MISRA's \"pointer to const whenever possible\" rule."
