  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types where possible. The fragments selected are all the sites where pointer types/assignments could involve missing or mismatched const qualifications: the function parameter list (which declares pointer parameters), the assignment to strm->next_in (a const cast is present and must be checked against the z_stream field type), the assignment to strm->next_out (assignment between buffer pointers of potentially different const qualifications), and the memcpy call (source/destination pointer const-correctness). Other lines in the function (numeric assignments to avail_in/avail_out, CHUNK checks, flush logic, allocation/reallocation/free, arithmetic on sizes, the loop structure, and the deflate call invocation) do not introduce additional pointer types or pointer-to-const relationships that could affect compliance with Rule 8.13, so they do not need investigation for this specific rule."
