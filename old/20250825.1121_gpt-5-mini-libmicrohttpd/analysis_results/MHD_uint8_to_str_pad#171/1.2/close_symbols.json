  "explanation": "- mhd_assert: This is a macro (or function-like macro) used in the function. Its expansion may contain compiler-specific extensions (statement expressions, __attribute__, __builtin_*, asm, etc.). To decide if the target function uses language extensions you must inspect the exact definition/expansion of mhd_assert.\n- uint8_t (definition / stdint.h): The fixed-width integer type may be provided via stdint.h or via platform-specific typedefs/headers. Some implementations provide these via compiler extensions or nonstandard headers; you need the exact typedef/header to verify no extension is used.\n- size_t (definition / stddef.h): size_t is a typedef supplied by the implementation. Some platforms/headers may use compiler-specific constructs to define it; checking its definition ensures the function does not rely on any extension.\n- translation-unit/project headers that declare/define MHD_* macros (e.g. the library header that defines mhd_assert and any MHD_ attribute macros): The file that contains MHD_ prefixed macros may introduce attributes or macros that expand to compiler extensions (for example attribute annotations on functions or parameters). These headers must be examined.\n- compiler/implementation predefined macros and attribute macros (e.g. __GNUC__, __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*/__asm__ macros if present in included headers): Even if not obvious in the function body, included headers may use these compiler-specific features. To determine whether the compiled translation unit uses explicit language extensions you must know which compiler/implementation macros and attribute macros are visible in the TU and how they are used by included headers.\n\nThese symbols/definitions are the only additional items required to determine whether the target function (including the effect of macro expansions it uses) relies on compiler language extensions. The function body itself contains only standard C constructs; potential extensions can only come from type/macro definitions and included headers (not from callers in the provided call graph)."
