  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses only standard C features: standard integer types (uint8_t, size_t), ordinary casts, arithmetic and control statements, and a macro defined as ((void)0). There are no occurrences of known extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions, inline assembler, nested functions, variable-length array extensions, designated initializers beyond standard C, or other compiler-specific keywords. The /**< ... */ comment is just documentation-style comment syntax and not a language extension. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
