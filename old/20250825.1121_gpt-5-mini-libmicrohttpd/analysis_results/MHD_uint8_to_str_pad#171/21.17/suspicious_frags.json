  "explanation": "No calls to the <string.h> string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided code. Rule 21.17 specifically targets use of those standard library string functions and their potential to access beyond object bounds; therefore the rule is not directly applicable to these fragments.\n\nFurthermore, the direct buffer writes in MHD_uint8_to_str_pad are preceded by an initial buf_size == 0 check and subsequent checks of pos against buf_size before further writes, so the function\u2019s own bounds checks prevent out-of-bounds writes in normal operation. In MHD_uint16_to_str, writes to *chr occur only inside a loop guarded by while (0 != buf_size) and buf_size is decremented on each write, so the loop control prevents overwriting beyond the provided buffer size. These behaviors address the out-of-bounds risks that Rule 21.17 is concerned with for string library calls.\n\nNote: General concerns such as passing a NULL buf with a non-zero buf_size, or other API-contract violations, are outside the scope of MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 (which is limited to the standard <string.h> functions) and therefore were not flagged here."
