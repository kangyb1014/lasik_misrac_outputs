This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_uint8_to_str_pad can write beyond the bounds of the buffers it is given (the MISRA rule in question), the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- get_date_str (definition): This function is the direct caller. Its body shows how it constructs/allocates the buffer, the exact pointer passed as buf, the buf_size value passed, the order and number of calls to MHD_uint8_to_str_pad and other formatting helpers, and any arithmetic that advances the buffer pointer or reduces the remaining size. All of those determine whether consecutive writes from MHD_uint8_to_str_pad can overflow the supplied object.\n\n- get_date_header (definition): This is the caller of get_date_str. It may provide a buffer or buffer size constraints to get_date_str. To prove absence (or presence) of out-of-bounds writes you must check the full call chain: the ultimate buffer origin and its allocated size are required.\n\n- MHD_uint16_to_str (definition): get_date_str also calls this function to write into the same buffer region. Its behavior (how many bytes it writes, how it consumes buf_size and advances the buffer pointer) affects remaining space when MHD_uint8_to_str_pad is invoked. Without this, you cannot reason about cumulative writes that could overflow the object.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro / definition): The target calls mhd_assert(3 >= min_digits). Depending on the definition (no-op, abort, side effects) it can affect control flow or enable/disable runtime checks; you must know its semantics to reason about whether invalid min_digits values could reach the body and cause extra writes.\n\n- Prototypes/declarations for MHD_uint8_to_str_pad and MHD_uint16_to_str: Ensure the signatures used by callers match the implementation (types, parameter order). This is needed to ensure buf and buf_size passed by callers correspond to the parameters analyzed here.\n\n- Headers/typedefs that define size_t and uint8_t (e.g. <stddef.h>, <stdint.h>): To reason about numeric ranges, overflow, and comparisons (e.g. buf_size <= pos), you need the exact types. For example, size_t is unsigned and its width affects wrap-around behavior if caller computations are done in the caller prior to passing buf_size.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst see: where the buffer originates, its allocated size, how much each formatting call writes, and whether any caller can pass a buf_size < actual writes or pass a pointer to a smaller object \u2014 which is necessary to decide compliance with the MISRA rule on bounds of object accesses."
