  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages found relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in the function is the parameter \"char *buf\", which is explicitly written to (buf[pos++] = ...); therefore it must not be const and does not violate the rule. There are no other pointer parameters, local pointer variables, or pointer-to-object uses in the code that could be made const. The mhd_assert argument and other variables are non-pointer scalar types, and the integer-to-char casts do not involve pointer types. Consequently, there are no code fragments here that require investigation for Rule 8.13."
