The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) mhd_assert: This macro/function is invoked inside MHD_uint8_to_str_pad. Its definition may expand to code that contains a for loop or has side effects (modifying objects, including potential loop counters) \u2014 such behaviour would be part of the function body for MISRA for-loop analysis. To decide compliance you must inspect the actual mhd_assert expansion/implementation.\n\n2) get_date_str: This function is a caller of MHD_uint8_to_str_pad (per the static call graph). MISRA\u2019s rule treats the behaviour of a for loop body as including any functions called from within that statement. To determine whether any for-loop that calls MHD_uint8_to_str_pad (in get_date_str) is well-formed you must examine get_date_str\u2019s loops (their loop counters, side effects in clauses) and how it invokes MHD_uint8_to_str_pad.\n\n3) MHD_uint16_to_str: Although not called by the target function, it is called by get_date_str. If get_date_str contains for loops that call multiple helper functions, the combined behaviour of all called helpers (including MHD_uint16_to_str) can affect whether the loop body modifies loop counters or other objects used in the loop clauses. Therefore its implementation must be checked when analysing get_date_str\u2019s loops that include calls to these helpers."
