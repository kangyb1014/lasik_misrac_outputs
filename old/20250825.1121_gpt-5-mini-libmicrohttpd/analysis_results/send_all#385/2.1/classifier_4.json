  "scenario": "The fragment is reachable when send() returns 0 (e.g. peer has closed the connection or no bytes were sent). In that case ret == 0 and the break is executed. The earlier EAGAIN handling sets ret = 0 but uses continue, so that path does not reach this check; therefore the if (0 == ret) { break; } is reachable and not an instance of unreachable code."
