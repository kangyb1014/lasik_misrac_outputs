  "explanation": "- send: The runtime return values and error behavior of send determine whether the branches (ret < 0, ret == 0, and positive ret) can be taken. You need the concrete send prototype/semantics on the target platform (return type, when it can return 0, when it sets errno) to decide if any branch is unreachable.\n- errno: The code tests errno against EAGAIN; to decide reachability of that inner branch you must know how/when errno is updated for socket errors on the target platform/build.\n- EAGAIN: The specific error code compared in the inner branch. Its value and whether send/WSA APIs ever set errno to EAGAIN on the build target affect whether that branch is reachable.\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: These preprocessor macros select which send signature/cast is compiled. Knowing which branch of the #if is active is necessary to know which send semantics apply (POSIX vs native Win32 behavior), which affects reachability of branches.\n- ssize_t: ret is declared ssize_t; knowing the signedness and width is necessary to reason about comparisons (0 > ret) and the cast (size_t) ret used in the loop increment \u2014 this influences whether loop progress/termination is possible and whether any code is effectively unreachable.\n- size_t: off and len are size_t; you must know their ranges and semantics to reason about the loop condition (off < len) and whether off can change, which affects reachability of code after the loop.\n- WSAGetLastError and WSAEWOULDBLOCK: On native Win32 sockets, errors are typically reported via WSAGetLastError/WSA error codes (e.g. WSAEWOULDBLOCK) rather than errno/EAGAIN. To decide if the errno==EAGAIN check (and its consequent branch) can ever be true on Windows, you must know whether the build uses POSIX-like errno behavior or the Winsock error API (and whether mappings exist).\n\nIncluding these symbols lets the next analyzer determine, for the actual target build/platform, which conditional compilation path is used and whether the comparisons and loop progress conditions can ever be true or false \u2014 i.e., whether any of the branches in send_all are provably unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code)."
