  "scenario": "No \u2014 the fragment does not itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. The two send() calls are selected by the preprocessor: only one branch is present in any given translation unit and each branch is platform-specific (POSIX vs native Win32). That means there is no unreachable code in the compiled translation unit, and both branches are potentially reachable across different builds/targets. (A violation scenario would be if the project is guaranteed to be built for a single configuration only and the other branch is never built in any translation unit across the entire project \u2014 then that dead branch would be unreachable and could violate Rule 2.1.)"
