  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (needed to determine if any <string.h> functions could cause out-of-bounds accesses related to send_all):\n\n- make_blocking: send_all calls this helper before sending. It must be inspected in case it manipulates the buffer, its length, or calls any <string.h> routines (memcpy/memmove/strlen/etc.) that could produce out-of-bounds pointers/lengths seen by send_all.\n\n- send: the system/socket send() is the function that reads from the buf pointer. Confirming its prototype/behavior (and platform differences) ensures that send_all is not relying on implicit behavior of a string routine and clarifies how many bytes are consumed/read (so we can reason about buffer bounds). Also check that send does not itself wrap or call any string.h helper in this code base.\n\n- errno: send_all checks errno for EAGAIN on failed send. errno must be known to correctly interpret error handling paths (loop continue vs break), which affects whether send_all might attempt further reads/writes beyond the provided len in subsequent iterations.\n\n- EAGAIN: the specific error token used to decide to retry. Its meaning influences control flow and whether repeated attempts could cause unexpected buffer indexing or length misinterpretation.\n\n- ws_send_frame: one of send_all's callers that constructs the buf/len pair passed to send_all. To determine if any <string.h> function produced an out-of-bounds pointer or incorrect length, you must inspect the caller that builds the buffer (e.g., use of memcpy/strlen/strcat when framing data).\n\n- run_usock: another caller of send_all. run_usock may prepare or modify buffers passed to send_all or call other helpers that use <string.h>. The caller chain must be inspected to trace the origin of buf and len.\n\n- ws_receive_frame: reachable from run_usock and part of the same subsystem; include it because run_usock may use or transform frame data via ws_receive_frame or related routines, so string operations may be present in that code path affecting buffer state.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: callable from run_usock; include because higher-level upgrade or framing actions could allocate/manipulate buffers with string.h functions that eventually end up passed to send_all.\n\n- MHD_socket: the socket type used by send_all; on different platforms this may map to different underlying types (affecting the send prototype\u2014important for understanding the Windows-specific cast to int and potential length truncation issues, which bear on bounds reasoning).\n\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: these preprocessor symbols control the send call signature and length casting in the function (the code uses a cast to int under the Native W32 branch). Platform-specific signatures/casts can affect whether the length passed to send could be truncated or mishandled; this interacts with bounds reasoning and must be considered.\n\nOverall: to decide if the MISRA rule about <string.h> functions is violated, you must (a) confirm that send_all itself does not call any <string.h> routines (it doesn't), and (b) trace callers and immediate callees (make_blocking and the call site builders in ws_send_frame/run_usock and related helpers) to ensure none of those functions use string.h routines in a way that could produce an out-of-bounds buf or incorrect len that send_all would then use. The above symbols are the minimal set required to perform that trace and to understand platform-specific send semantics that affect bounds reasoning."
