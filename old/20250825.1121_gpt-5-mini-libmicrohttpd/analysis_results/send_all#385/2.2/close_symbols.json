  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required\n\n- send\n  - send_all's behavior (return values, error signalling) depends entirely on the semantics of the send call. To decide whether branches (ret < 0, ret == 0) can occur and whether removing code changes behaviour we must know how send reports partial writes, errors and end-of-connection on the target platform.\n\n- errno\n  - The code tests errno against EAGAIN after a negative send return. Whether that test can be true (and therefore whether the EAGAIN branch is actually executed) depends on how errno is set by the underlying socket implementation.\n\n- EAGAIN\n  - The specific macro tested determines whether the EAGAIN branch is reachable. On some platforms (POSIX) EAGAIN is used; on others (Winsock) a different error is used (WSAEWOULDBLOCK). Knowing the definition and value is needed to conclude reachability.\n\n- ssize_t and size_t\n  - These typedefs determine value ranges and sign behaviour. Understanding the types is necessary to reason about casts, comparisons, overflow and whether certain branches (e.g. ret < 0) are meaningful.\n\n- MHD_socket\n  - The socket type may be an int on POSIX or SOCKET on Windows; this affects which send overload/prototype is used and platform-specific error semantics (errno vs Winsock error API).\n\n- make_blocking\n  - The static call graph lists make_blocking as a callee of send_all (or it may be invoked in the same code-path); make_blocking can change the socket blocking mode. If the socket is forced to blocking mode before the loop, EAGAIN/WOULDBLOCK cannot occur and the EAGAIN branch would be dead. You must inspect make_blocking implementation to determine this.\n\n- run_usock and ws_send_frame (callers)\n  - The contexts that call send_all determine the socket state passed in (blocking vs non-blocking, already closed, etc.). To decide if internal branches are actually reachable in the program, the call-sites and their socket setup must be inspected.\n\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__ macros\n  - The code contains conditional compilation that affects the send call signature (casts to int) and platform-specific behaviour. Determining which branch is compiled influences error semantics and therefore reachability of branches.\n\n- winsock error mapping (WSAGetLastError / WSAEWOULDBLOCK)\n  - On Windows, Winsock does not use errno/EAGAIN; it uses its own error codes and API. To know whether the errno==EAGAIN test can ever be true on Windows builds (or whether that test is dead code), you must know how Winsock reports EWOULDBLOCK and whether the code maps that into errno.\n\n- socket non-blocking control functions and macros (fcntl / ioctl / ioctlsocket, O_NONBLOCK / FIONBIO)\n  - The reachability of the EAGAIN/WOULDBLOCK branch depends on whether the socket can be non-blocking at call time. Any code that calls these APIs (directly or via helpers like make_blocking) must be inspected so you can determine whether the EAGAIN path is possible or dead.\n\nConcise rationale\n\nAll of the above symbols are necessary to determine whether the branches inside send_all (particularly the errno==EAGAIN handling and the ret==0/ret<0 cases) can ever be executed in the real program. If any branch is provably impossible given the platform and callers (for example, socket always forced blocking by make_blocking or callers), that branch would be dead code under the MISRA definition; conversely, if the branch is reachable, removing it would change behaviour. Inspecting these symbols lets the next analyzer conclude reachability precisely."
