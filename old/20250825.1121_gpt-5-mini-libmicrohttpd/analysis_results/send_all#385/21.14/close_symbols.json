  "explanation": "send \u2014 send_all directly calls the socket API send; inspect send (or any local wrapper) to ensure it does not internally call memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\nmake_blocking \u2014 listed as a callee in the static call graph; any memcmp usage in this function (or functions it calls) reachable from send_all would make the target violate the rule.\nmemcmp \u2014 the specific Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule; presence/invocation anywhere in send_all or in its reachable callees is the direct thing to detect.\nerrno \u2014 used by send_all to check error codes; include to verify no macro/trick redefinition or wrapper expands to memcmp or string comparisons.\nEAGAIN \u2014 the specific error constant tested in send_all; include to fully inspect the error\u2011handling path and any macros or helpers that might hide string comparisons.\nrun_usock \u2014 a caller of send_all from the call graph; include to check whether there are inline/hidden uses of memcmp in contextual code (or if the caller supplies null\u2011terminated strings that might change the interpretation of any memcmp use in reachable code).\nws_send_frame \u2014 another caller of send_all; include for the same reason as run_usock (to inspect nearby code that could be inlined or otherwise make memcmp usage reachable)."
