  "explanation": "send: The loop progression depends on the return value of send (ret). You must know the possible values send can return (positive bytes sent, -1 on error, conditions that yield 0) and when it returns -1 with errno==EAGAIN so you can decide whether the controlling expression off < len can become invariant.\nerrno: The code branches on errno after a -1 return from send; understanding errno semantics is required to judge whether the loop will make forward progress or become invariant.\nEAGAIN: The function explicitly tests errno == EAGAIN and sets ret = 0 + continue; this is the main path that can prevent off from advancing, so you must know the meaning/semantics of EAGAIN on the target platform.\nEWOULDBLOCK: On some platforms EAGAIN is equivalent to EWOULDBLOCK; analysis should consider either macro as a blocking indication that can cause the same invariant behavior.\nssize_t: ret is ssize_t. You must know its signed range/width to reason about negative returns, conversion to size_t for off increment, and potential sign/unsigned conversion effects on off += (size_t)ret.\nsize_t: off and len are size_t. Their ranges and wrap/underflow behavior are relevant to determine whether off < len is ever true/changes, and how casting ret to size_t affects off.\nMHD_socket: The socket type and its platform semantics (e.g. underlying descriptor/handle) can affect send behavior (blocking vs non-blocking) and therefore whether send returns EAGAIN or blocks.\nmake_blocking: Present in the static call graph and relevant because changing the socket blocking mode affects send behavior (whether send blocks or returns EAGAIN). If make_blocking is called before or by the caller, the loop\u2019s controlling expression behavior changes.\nrun_usock: A caller of send_all in the call graph. The caller may set up socket state (blocking/non-blocking), call make_blocking, or pass particular len/sock values that affect whether the loop can become invariant; include it to inspect calling context.\nws_send_frame: Another caller; include to inspect alternate calling contexts that could make the controlling expression invariant or not (different socket states/lengths).\nINT_MAX: On Windows the code casts (len - off) to int for send; you must consider INT_MAX and possible truncation of len - off (and resulting send behavior) when reasoning whether off will advance and whether the loop condition can become invariant."
