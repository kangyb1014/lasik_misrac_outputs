The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) send \u2014 This function is called inside the for-loop body. MISRA treats the behaviour of functions called in the loop body as part of the loop body itself, so you must inspect send's prototype/implementation to determine whether it modifies any objects used in the for-clause expressions (off, len, or any object used by the third clause). You also need to know whether send has other side-effects that could be considered modifications of objects referenced in the loop clauses.\n\n2) make_blocking \u2014 The static call graph shows send_all calls make_blocking. If make_blocking is (or can be) invoked inside the loop body (or otherwise affects state visible to the loop clauses), its behaviour must be inspected to ensure it does not modify the loop counter or any objects used in the second or third clause.\n\n3) errno \u2014 errno is read in the loop body after send returns; it is a global object whose value is set by system calls. To reason about side-effects and whether objects used in the for-clauses are modified by the body (directly or indirectly via called functions), you must know how errno is used/updated by send and whether that interacts with the loop clauses.\n\n4) EAGAIN \u2014 The comparison against EAGAIN decides control flow (continue vs break). Although normally a compile-time constant, you must verify its definition (macro/enum) and semantics to correctly reason about the loop\u2019s control flow and whether that control flow could cause modifications to objects used in the for-clause expressions.\n\nNote: local symbols declared in the function (off, ret, len, buf, sock and their types ssize_t/size_t) are already present in the function body; the above additional symbols are the external/global ones required to fully determine whether the loop satisfies the MISRA well\u2011formedness constraints (in particular whether the third clause uses objects that are modified in the loop body)."
