First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of send_all.\n```c\nstatic size_t\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock, const unsigned char *buf, size_t len)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t off;\n\n  for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], len - off, 0);\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], (int) (len - off), 0);\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  return off;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false).

Clause 3 of Rule 14.2 forbids the third clause from using objects that are modified in the loop body, so the for loop is not well-formed.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function send_all:\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. Rule 14.2 requires that the third clause (the iteration expression) shall not use objects that are modified in the for-loop body. In the code the third clause is off += (size_t) ret while ret is assigned inside the loop body (ret = send(...); ret = 0; ...). Thus the iteration expression depends on an object that is modified in the loop body and the for statement is not well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. A compliant refactor is to leave the third clause empty (for(off = 0; off < len; ) { ... off += (size_t)ret; }) or otherwise ensure the iteration expression uses only the loop counter (and permitted loop-control flag) and not objects modified in the loop body."
