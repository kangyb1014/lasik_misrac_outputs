  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following send_all code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 14.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of send_all.\n```c\nstatic size_t\nsend_all (MHD_socket sock, const unsigned char *buf, size_t len)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t off;\n\n  for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret)\n  {\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], len - off, 0);\n#else  /* Native W32 */\n    ret = send (sock, (const void *) &buf[off], (int) (len - off), 0);\n#endif /* Native W32 */\n    if (0 > ret)\n    {\n      if (EAGAIN == errno)\n      {\n        ret = 0;\n        continue;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    if (0 == ret)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  return off;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop is not well-formed because the third clause uses ret (off += (size_t) ret) while ret is assigned inside the loop body (ret = send(...)). Clause 3 of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter and not use objects that are modified in the loop body. The shown fragment (if (0 == ret) { break; }) itself does not modify the loop counter and is not the direct cause, but the overall for statement violates Rule 14.2 because the third clause depends on ret which is modified in the body.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function send_all:\nstatic void\nmake_blocking (MHD_socket fd)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS)\n  int flags;\n\n  flags = fcntl (fd, F_GETFL);\n  if (-1 == flags)\n    abort ();\n  if ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags)\n    if (-1 == fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, flags & ~O_NONBLOCK))\n      abort ();\n#elif defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  unsigned long flags = 0;\n\n  if (0 != ioctlsocket (fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags))\n    abort ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the for statement for (off = 0; off < len; off += (size_t) ret) the loop counter is off, but the third clause reads ret which is assigned in the loop body (ret = send(...)). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires that the third clause shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body. The rule also treats the behaviour of the loop body as including called functions (send), so ret is considered modified by the body. Therefore the third clause violates Rule 14.2. \n\nA compliant rewrite would avoid referencing an object modified in the loop body from the for-clause (for example convert to a while loop and update off inside the body, or remove the third clause and update off in the body)."
