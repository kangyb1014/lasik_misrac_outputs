  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" in send_all you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- send (POSIX prototype): The const-qualification of the buffer parameter in the POSIX send declaration (usually ssize_t send(int, const void *, size_t, int)) determines whether passing a pointer to const unsigned char (via &buf[off]) matches the callee's parameter or drops constness. You must inspect this prototype to see if any cast removes const.\n\n- send (Windows/Winsock prototype): On Windows the Winsock send signature (commonly int send(SOCKET, const char *, int, int) or older variants) may differ in parameter type or const-qualification. Because the function conditionally compiles different argument casts/lengths, you must check the Windows prototype to see whether const is preserved or discarded.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef): The type of the sock parameter could be a pointer type or an opaque type; knowing its typedef ensures there are no hidden pointer-to-non-const issues related to the socket argument or platform-specific overloads of send.\n\n- ssize_t (typedef): send_all declares ret as ssize_t; the exact typedef and its relationship to the send return type must match to ensure no implicit conversions that could affect how the call is resolved on the platform.\n\n- size_t (typedef): size_t is used for len/off and is part of the send signature on POSIX. Confirming its definition ensures the correct send overload is being considered.\n\n- errno (extern/definition): errno is tested for EAGAIN; while not directly about pointer constness, understanding errno's definition is needed to confirm that no pointer-modifying side effects occur via macros or wrapper functions in the platform headers.\n\n- EAGAIN (macro/errno value): The code branches on EAGAIN; ensure this macro is from the expected header and that no platform-specific macro redefinition affects the code path or the need for casts.\n\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__ (preprocessor macros): The function uses conditional compilation to choose different send argument forms. You must know which macro is defined for the target build to pick the correct send prototype and casting behaviour when checking const-qualification.\n\n- make_blocking (function prototype): The static call graph shows send_all calls make_blocking. Even if not visible in the snippet, include its prototype to check whether it is passed any buffer pointer or otherwise modifies buffer constness expectations (or whether it changes socket blocking mode which might influence which send API is used).\n\nCollecting these symbols (actual declarations/prototypes from the target build headers) lets the next analyzer determine whether any cast or call in send_all causes const-qualification to be lost or violated relative to the target platform's send declaration, and thus whether the MISRA rule is infringed."
