  "explanation": "ssize_t \u2014 send_all declares a local variable of type ssize_t. ssize_t is not part of ISO C (it is POSIX); to decide if this is a language/ABI extension you must inspect the typedef location (e.g. <sys/types.h> or platform headers) and the compiler/library documentation that provides it. size_t \u2014 standard C type, but include to confirm definition origin; verify it is the standard type and not a platform-specific redefinition. MHD_socket \u2014 the function parameter uses MHD_socket; this is an application/platform typedef that may alias a platform-specific socket type (e.g. Windows SOCKET). Its definition must be checked to see whether it relies on compiler/platform extensions. send \u2014 the call to send is a platform socket API with differing prototypes between POSIX and Winsock; you must inspect the declaration used when compiling this code (sys/socket.h vs winsock2.h) to determine whether a non\u2011standard/extended API is being invoked. errno \u2014 the code inspects errno; on some toolchains errno is implemented via macros or functions (e.g. __errno_location) which are compiler/runtime extensions; verify how errno is provided. EAGAIN \u2014 this macro/constant comes from errno.h and is POSIX (not ISO C); check whether its use relies on non\u2011standard headers/constants. _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__ \u2014 these predefined macros control conditional compilation here. To determine whether the code is relying on compiler-specific extensions you must know which predefined macros the compiler supplies and whether the guarded code paths use non\u2011standard constructs (e.g. winsock types).\n\nCollecting the above symbol definitions (their headers and platform/compiler documentation) is necessary to decide if any non\u2011ISO\u2011C types, macros or platform/implementation specific features (i.e. language/library/compiler extensions) are being used by send_all."
