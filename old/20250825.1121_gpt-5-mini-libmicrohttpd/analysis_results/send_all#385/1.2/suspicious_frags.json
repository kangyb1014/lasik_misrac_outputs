  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the function use standard, portable C language constructs (static function scope, size_t, pointer indexing &buf[off], casts to (const void *), for/if/break/continue control flow, return of a size_t). Those do not represent compiler-specific language extensions and so do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. The fragments reported above are the locations that may rely on platform-/implementation-specific types or behavior (POSIX/Windows differences, use of ssize_t/errno/EAGAIN, and the conditional send() call signatures) and thus should be examined to confirm they do not depend on compiler-specific language extensions."
