  "explanation": "To determine whether send_all is directly or indirectly recursive we must examine all functions reachable from send_all and any functions that could lead back to send_all. The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- make_blocking: called directly by send_all; we must inspect its body to see if it (directly or indirectly) calls send_all.\n- run_usock: appears as a caller of send_all and also calls make_blocking and other routines; we must inspect it because a path like send_all -> make_blocking -> ... -> run_usock -> send_all would constitute indirect recursion.\n- ws_send_frame: a caller of send_all; we must inspect it to ensure it does not get called (directly or via other calls) by send_all or its callees, which could create a cycle.\n- MHD_upgrade_action: a callee of run_usock; include it because run_usock -> MHD_upgrade_action -> ... could lead back to send_all.\n- ws_receive_frame: another callee of run_usock; include it for the same reason \u2014 it might (directly or indirectly) call send_all and form a cycle.\n\nYou do not need system calls like send/errno for MISRA recursion checking. The above symbols let the next analyst trace all potential call paths that could form a cycle involving send_all."
