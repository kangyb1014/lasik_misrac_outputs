  "explanation": "make_blocking: The static call graph shows send_all calls make_blocking. To prove send_all does not modify its parameters you must know whether make_blocking is a function or a macro (and if a macro, what it expands to). A macro could expand to code that assigns to the argument expression (e.g. (s) = ...), which would constitute modification of the parameter expression 'sock' when make_blocking(sock) appears in the function. send: The code calls send(...) (or a platform-specific variant). You must inspect the send declaration or any macro wrapper used on the target platform to ensure it is not a macro that performs assignments to its arguments (or otherwise modifies the local parameter variables via side-effects). Even if send is a library/system call that only reads the buffer, a wrapper macro could hide an assignment to a parameter. MHD_socket: The exact typedef of MHD_socket is required to determine whether the 'sock' parameter is a scalar (e.g. an int) or a pointer type. MISRA's wording distinguishes between modifying a pointer parameter itself (forbidden) and modifying the object pointed to (allowed). If MHD_socket is a pointer type, additional care is needed to determine whether any called routine or macro modifies the pointer variable rather than the pointee."
