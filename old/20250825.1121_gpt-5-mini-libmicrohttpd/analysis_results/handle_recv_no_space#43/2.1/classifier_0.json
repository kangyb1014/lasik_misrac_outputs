  "scenario": "The code after the switch (mhd_assert(0)) is reachable if stage equals MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE or some unexpected/invalid enum value (caught by the default). Although normal valid stages return inside the switch, the presence of the explicit case MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE and default: break means the final mhd_assert(0) is a defensive runtime trap for impossible/invalid states rather than truly unreachable code. Therefore Rule 2.1 is not violated."
