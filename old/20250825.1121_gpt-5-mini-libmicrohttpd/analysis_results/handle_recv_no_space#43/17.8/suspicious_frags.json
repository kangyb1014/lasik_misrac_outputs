  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I inspected handle_recv_no_space and the related functions provided (connection_close_error, transmit_error_response_len, handle_req_headers_no_space, has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer, handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space, handle_req_footers_no_space). Rule 17.8 forbids assigning to function parameter variables (e.g. reassigning the pointer parameter itself or the by-value parameter). I found no assignments to any parameter variables (no statements like \"c = ...\", \"connection = ...\", \"stage = ...\", \"add_header = ...\", etc.). All modifications are to objects pointed to by pointer parameters (e.g. connection->state, connection->read_buffer, c->rq.*), which is permitted by the rule. Freeing or passing pointer parameters to other functions occurs, but the pointer variables themselves are not overwritten. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 17.8 in the supplied code."
