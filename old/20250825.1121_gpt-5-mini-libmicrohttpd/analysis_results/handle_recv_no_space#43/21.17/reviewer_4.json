True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nPotential violation: the call passes a raw receive buffer pointer and an offset (c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_offset) to a function that may use string.h routines that expect a NUL-terminated C string or that copy more bytes than the buffer actually contains. For example, if the buffer capacity is N and c->read_buffer_offset == N (buffer full) and the buffer is not NUL-terminated (typical for a raw recv buffer), and handle_req_footers_no_space calls strlen(c->read_buffer) or strcpy/strcat/strspn on it, those functions will read past the end of the buffer (out-of-bounds). Similarly, if the callee uses memcpy/strncpy with a length > actual allocated size (e.g. read_buffer_offset+1), an out-of-bounds access would occur. The fragment itself does not guarantee safety \u2014 a violation can occur depending on the callee\u2019s use of string.h functions (e.g. calling strlen on a non-NUL-terminated receive buffer) \u2014 therefore the rule can be violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function handle_recv_no_space:\n#define MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(d) (0!=(d->options&(MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD)))\n...\n#define ERROR_MSG_DATA_NOT_HANDLED_BY_APP \"<html><head><title>Internal server error</title></head>\"\"<body>Please ask the developer of this Web server to carefully \"\"read the GNU libmicrohttpd documentation about connection \"\"management and blocking.</body></html>\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The reported violation is not supported by the code shown. handle_recv_no_space itself does not call any <string.h> functions; it only forwards c->read_buffer and an explicit length (c->read_buffer_offset) to helper routines (handle_req_headers_no_space, handle_req_footers_no_space, handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space, \u2026). MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 prohibits uses of the <string.h> routines that can access beyond the bounds of the objects pointed to; a violation would exist only if one of the callees actually invokes a string.h routine (e.g. strlen, strcpy, strcat, memcpy, etc.) in a way that can read or write past the provided buffer/length. The scenario described by Agent A (a callee calling strlen on a non-NUL-terminated receive buffer or copying more bytes than available) is plausible, but it is speculation about the implementation of those helper functions rather than a demonstrated violation in handle_recv_no_space itself. Therefore the report that this function violates Rule 21.17 is not correct as-is. Recommendation: inspect the implementations of the called helpers and ensure they either (a) treat the data as non-string raw buffers and use length-bounded operations (memcpy/memmove/memchr/memset with explicit lengths) or (b) ensure the buffer is NUL-terminated before calling string functions or use strnlen/strncpy with appropriate length bounds. If any callee uses unbounded string functions on the raw receive buffer without checking the provided length, that callee would be the location of a Rule 21.17 violation."
