True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nPotential violation: the fragment passes c->read_buffer and its filled length c->read_buffer_offset to handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space, but the fragment does not show how that function processes the buffer. If the callee treats c->read_buffer as a NUL\u2011terminated C string and calls string.h functions that expect termination (for example strlen(c->read_buffer), strchr(c->read_buffer,'\\n'), strspn, etc.) without using the provided length, and the buffer is not NUL\u2011terminated within c->read_buffer_offset, those functions can read beyond the valid bytes of the buffer. That would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Use length-aware routines (memchr, memcmp, strnlen with known bounds, or ensure safe NUL termination within bounds) to avoid the violation.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function handle_recv_no_space:\n#define MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(d) (0!=(d->options&(MHD_USE_INTERNAL_POLLING_THREAD)))\n...\n#define ERROR_MSG_DATA_NOT_HANDLED_BY_APP \"<html><head><title>Internal server error</title></head>\"\"<body>Please ask the developer of this Web server to carefully \"\"read the GNU libmicrohttpd documentation about connection \"\"management and blocking.</body></html>\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The reported violation is not confirmed by the provided code. Rule 21.17 concerns actual uses of <string.h> functions that can read past object bounds. The function handle_recv_no_space itself does not call any <string.h> functions; it only forwards c->read_buffer and its valid length c->read_buffer_offset to helper functions (handle_req_headers_no_space, handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space, handle_req_footers_no_space). Whether a Rule 21.17 violation exists depends entirely on the implementations of those callee functions. If any of those callees use string.h routines that expect NUL-terminated C strings (e.g. strlen, strchr, strchrnul, strspn, etc.) without ensuring a terminating NUL within the provided length, then that would indeed violate Rule 21.17. But no such misuse is visible in the shown fragment, so the claim that handle_recv_no_space itself violates Rule 21.17 is not correct as presented.\n\nRecommendation: inspect the implementations of the callee functions. To be safe, either (a) ensure the buffer is NUL-terminated at or before read_buffer_offset before calling APIs that expect C strings, or (b) ensure the callees use length-aware operations (memchr/memmem/memcmp or bounded variants like strnlen with the known max) so they cannot read beyond the provided length."
