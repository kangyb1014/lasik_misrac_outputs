  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the function depend on runtime values (parameters, structure members, or function calls) and are therefore not invariant:\n- The switch(stage) controlling expression is the parameter 'stage' (not a compile-time constant).\n- All if expressions inspect members of 'c->rq' or call functions (e.g. has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer(c)), so their values can vary at runtime.\n- The equality/inequality checks against enum constants (e.g. MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_NORMAL == stage) compare a runtime variable (stage) to constants \u2014 these are not invariant unless 'stage' is provably constant, which it is not here.\n- The many mhd_assert(...) lines are assertions and do not form selection/iteration controlling expressions in the code structure; they evaluate runtime conditions (often involving 'stage' or members of 'c') and thus are not invariant.\n\nThe only fragment that yields an invariant controlling expression to investigate is the final mhd_assert(0): it uses a constant false expression (0) and therefore is an invariant. This should be reviewed to ensure it is compliant with MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 (and to confirm that the use of an always-false assertion is intentional and acceptable in this context)."
