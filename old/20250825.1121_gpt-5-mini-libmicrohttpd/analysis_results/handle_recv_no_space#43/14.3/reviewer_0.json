The macro will expand to a conditional/controlling construct that tests the constant expression 0 (invariant). This uses an invariant controlling expression (a constant false) for error handling/reachability checking rather than for an allowed infinite loop/do-while constant-false exception, so it violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is correct in the typical case. The call mhd_assert(0) will normally expand (after preprocessing) into a controlling construct that tests a constant expression (for example via an if or the conditional operator) and thus produces an invariant controlling expression. That is exactly what MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 forbids (the allowed exceptions do not cover \u2018\u2018an assert of a constant false used as a reachability check\u2019\u2019).\n\nCaveat: whether this is actually a violation in your build depends on the precise definition of the mhd_assert macro and the preprocessing configuration. If mhd_assert is defined such that no controlling statement remains after expansion (for example it expands to ((void)0) when NDEBUG is set) then there is no invariant controlling expression and no violation. Also, if the macro\u2019s expansion uses only an outer do { ... } while(0) (the do-while(0) exception is permitted), you still must inspect the inner expansion \u2014 if that inner expansion contains an if or other controlling statement whose controlling expression is a compile-time constant, Rule 14.3 is still breached.\n\nSo: in the common/assert-implemented-as-if-or-?: form, the report is correct; if the macro expands to no controlling construct in your build environment, then it would not be a violation."
