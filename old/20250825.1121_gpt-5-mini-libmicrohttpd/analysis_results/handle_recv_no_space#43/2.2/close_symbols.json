  "explanation": "To decide whether any operations in handle_recv_no_space are dead code (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour) we must know which branches are reachable, which expressions can be true, and whether the operations have observable side effects. The listed symbols are required for that analysis for the following reasons:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): The function inspects many fields of the connection object; knowing the full structure is needed to determine which tests and accesses are meaningful and whether removing code that reads/modifies those fields would change behaviour.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection.rq (fields...): The decision logic (http_mthd, http_ver, have_chunked_upload, some_payload_processed, current_chunk_offset/current_chunk_size) depends on these fields. Their types, ranges and how they are updated elsewhere determine reachability of branches (e.g. chunked vs normal body handling).\n\n- enum MHD_ProcRecvDataStage and its values: The switch in handle_recv_no_space dispatches on these enum values. To determine if any case is effectively dead (never executed or executed but removable) we must know all possible enum values and how callers set them.\n\n- connection state constants: Many mhd_assert checks relate stage values to connection state. The precise semantics and possible transitions of these states (and who sets them) are needed to determine whether certain combinations \u2014 and thus corresponding case bodies \u2014 can actually occur.\n\n- HTTP method/version constants: The code uses comparisons on http_mthd and http_ver to decide between sending URI_TOO_LONG vs closing with different message. Understanding legal ranges and how http_mthd/http_ver are set elsewhere affects whether that branch is meaningful or removable.\n\n- HTTP status constants and error message ids: These identify observable side effects (responses sent). To decide if a call is dead we must know whether removing a transmit/close that returns a response would alter externally visible behaviour.\n\n- check_and_grow_read_buffer_space (caller) and try_grow_read_buffer: handle_recv_no_space has only one documented caller. Understanding when and with what parameters the caller invokes handle_recv_no_space is essential to determine which switch cases can be reached in practice.\n\n- has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer: The function's return controls a major branch (error response vs header handling). Its semantics determine whether that branch can be taken; if it never returns true in the relevant context then some error-handling code might be dead or vice versa.\n\n- connection_close_error and transmit_error_response_len/static: Both perform externally visible side effects (closing the connection, queuing responses). Determining whether calls to them are removable requires knowledge of their side effects and when they are invoked elsewhere.\n\n- handle_req_headers_no_space, handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space, handle_req_footers_no_space: These helper functions are invoked in several branches. To know whether these invocations are meaningful (and thus not dead) we must inspect what those functions do and whether their effects are observable by the rest of the program.\n\n- mhd_assert macro and MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ macro semantics: Assertions can abort or be compiled out; whether they are active affects reachability reasoning (an assert that aborts makes subsequent code unreachable in failure cases). MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ alters a runtime condition used in an assert and thus influences whether that assert can fail or be relied upon in analysis.\n\n- MHD_connection_close_ and MHD_queue_response (primitives used by callees): These are the concrete side-effecting primitives used by the callee routines; knowing their behaviour (closing socket, sending/queuing data) is required to conclude whether removing the calls in handle_recv_no_space would change externally observable behaviour.\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyst: (1) reason about which switch cases and branches are reachable given caller behaviour and connection/request state, (2) determine whether calls produce externally observable effects (network responses, connection close), and (3) understand whether any executed operations could be removed without changing program behaviour (the definition of dead code under MISRA). Without these definitions/semantics the reachability and side-effect analysis required to prove the absence or presence of dead code in handle_recv_no_space is incomplete."
