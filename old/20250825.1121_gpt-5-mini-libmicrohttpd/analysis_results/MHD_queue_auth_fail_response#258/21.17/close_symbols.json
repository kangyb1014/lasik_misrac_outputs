This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: This is the direct callee and must be inspected for any uses of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) on the parameters forwarded from the target (realm, opaque, response). Any out\u2011of\u2011bounds access would occur in that implementation.\\n- MHD_queue_auth_required_response3: Appears in the callee's static call graph; it may perform string operations on data propagated from the target call chain. Its implementation (and any string.h usage inside it) must be examined.\\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: The constant passed by the target can change control flow or buffer/length expectations inside the callee(s). Knowing its value/enum lets the analyzer determine code paths and related string operations.\\n- struct MHD_Connection: Definition and layout are required to understand how its members (if any are used in string ops) are accessed and whether pointer parameters reference buffers of adequate size.\\n- struct MHD_Response: Definition is required to inspect any string/buffer fields accessed or modified by the callee(s) (to check bounds for memcpy/strcpy/etc.).\\n- enum MHD_Result: The return type and any related status codes can indicate error branches or special handling that affect whether string functions are reached; include for control\u2011flow completeness.\\n- __builtin_unreachable: Present in the callee's call graph; include for completeness. It is a compiler builtin and does not perform string operations, so it is not a source of string.h bound violations but should be noted when reasoning about unreachable branches.\\nIn practice, to determine MISRA C string\u2011bounds compliance you need the full definitions/implementations of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 and MHD_queue_auth_required_response3, the relevant type definitions (MHD_Connection, MHD_Response), and the value/definition of MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5 (and any other constants/macros used by those functions). If those functions call any standard string.h routines, include their call sites/arguments as well to check for out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses."
