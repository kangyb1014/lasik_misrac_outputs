  "explanation": "- MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: The target simply forwards to this function. To decide if the MISRA rule is violated we must inspect its implementation (it may call memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings).\n- MHD_queue_auth_required_response3: This is a callee of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 per the call graph; its body must be checked for any memcmp (or string comparison) usage that would constitute a violation.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of the standard memcmp function. Include this symbol so the analyzer can identify direct uses (and verify whether memcmp is being applied to null\u2011terminated C strings rather than sized buffers)."
