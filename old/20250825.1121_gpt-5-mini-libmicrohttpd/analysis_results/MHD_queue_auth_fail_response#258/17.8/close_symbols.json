  "explanation": "1) MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: The target function only calls this symbol. To prove the target function itself does not modify its parameter variables you must examine the callee's declaration/definition. If MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 is a function, its body cannot directly assign to the caller's parameter variables, but if it is implemented as a function-like macro (or an inlined expansion in the same translation unit) the macro expansion could contain assignments to the identifiers (connection, realm, opaque, response, signal_stale) in the caller. Obtaining the exact declaration/definition (or macro expansion) is therefore required to show no assignment to the target function's parameter identifiers occurs as a result of the call.  \n\n2) MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: This token is passed as the final argument. Confirming its definition (enum constant vs. macro expression) is necessary because a function-like macro or a macro that expands to a complex expression (e.g., using the comma operator or side-effecting code) could introduce code that, when expanded in the call site, modifies caller identifiers. Verifying it is a simple constant (typical enum) rules out that source of implicit parameter modification."
