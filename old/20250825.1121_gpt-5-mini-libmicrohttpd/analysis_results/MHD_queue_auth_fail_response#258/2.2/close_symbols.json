  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for a dead\u2011code (MISRA) analysis of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response:\n\n- MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: The wrapper immediately forwards to this function. You must inspect its implementation to determine whether the wrapper is redundant (i.e. removal would not change behaviour) or whether it performs a distinct role (so not dead). The callee may also contain unreachable code or side effects that affect the decision.\n\n- MHD_queue_auth_required_response3: This is called by MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 (callee of the callee). Its behaviour (side effects, timing, error paths) can determine whether the wrapper preserves semantics; you need to follow the full call chain to decide if removing the wrapper changes observable behaviour.\n\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: The wrapper passes this constant as the final argument. If the constant alters control flow or side effects in the callee chain, removing the wrapper (or changing the default) could change behaviour; you must inspect the value/definition and its use.\n\n- MHD_EXTERN: This linkage/visibility macro controls whether the function is exported from a translation unit or DLL. A symbol that is externally visible may be used by other translation units or by external code; an exported wrapper can be non\u2011dead even if there are no internal callers. You must examine its definition to determine external visibility.\n\n- __builtin_unreachable: Present in the callee\u2019s call graph. This intrinsic affects compiler optimisation and the classification of unreachable vs dead code. You need to inspect how it is used in the callee to avoid confusing officially unreachable paths with dead code.\n\n- enum MHD_Result: Return type influences ABI and whether this function matches signatures expected by callers or callback tables. Knowing the exact type is needed when checking function\u2011pointer compatibility/registration.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection and struct MHD_Response: Argument types are required to determine whether this function matches any callback or dispatch table signatures (i.e. whether its address could be stored/taken), and to inspect any side effects on these types that might differ if the wrapper were removed.\n\n- linker/export symbol table and any function\u2011pointer registration arrays (places that can take a function address): Dead\u2011code analysis must include non\u2011call references. The wrapper could be referenced from data tables, registration APIs, or exported symbols used by other modules; inspect these to see if the function address is taken or if it is exported to other units/runtimes.\n\n- all callers / address\u2011taken occurrences of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response (use cross\u2011reference): The most direct check for dead code is whether the function is ever invoked or its address taken. The static call graph given shows no callers, but you must search the entire program (including non\u2011static references, indirect calls, and external link use) to be certain. Inspecting all callers/uses is mandatory to determine whether the function is dead.\n\nIn short: you need the callee implementation and its callees (to reason about behavioural equivalence), the constant the wrapper provides, linkage/visibility information (exports), any compiler intrinsics used, the full function type, and a global cross\u2011reference of callers/address\u2011taken occurrences to decide whether removing the wrapper would not affect program behaviour."
