  "explanation": "- MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: the target function merely forwards to this function. To decide whether the project contains unreachable code you must inspect the body of this callee (control flow, early returns, and any explicit unreachable markers) because any unreachable code reachable only through this call still counts for the project.\n- MHD_queue_auth_required_response3: this is a direct callee of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 (per the static call graph). Its implementation may contain unreachable code or call sites that lead to unreachable regions; it must be examined to determine if unreachable code exists anywhere in the call chain started by the target function.\n- __builtin_unreachable: presence of this compiler intrinsic in the callee(s) explicitly marks program points as unreachable. Its usage is directly relevant to the MISRA rule (it creates unreachable code locations), so the exact sites and contexts where it is invoked must be reviewed.\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: the constant passed by the target into the callee. Its definition (enum/macro) is needed to confirm the call signature and to inspect any conditional logic in the callee that branches on this value (which could create or avoid unreachable code paths)."
