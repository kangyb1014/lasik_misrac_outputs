  "explanation": "MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: the target simply forwards to this function with a fixed final argument; to decide if any controlling expression is invariant you must inspect the callee's source (conditions/loops dependent on its parameters or on that fixed argument). MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: the literal constant passed by the target can make expressions in the callee invariant (e.g. switch/if on the algorithm); you need its definition/value to see if it produces an invariant controlling expression. MHD_queue_auth_required_response3: shown as a callee of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2; its control flow may contain loops/conditions that become invariant when called with the forwarded arguments, so its body must be examined. __builtin_unreachable: present in the callee graph and affects control-flow analysis \u2014 its use can mark code paths as unreachable and is relevant when assessing whether a controlling expression is effectively invariant or leads to unreachable branches. Any enums/macros referenced by MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 and MHD_queue_auth_required_response3 (e.g. other digest-algorithm constants): these symbolic constants may be used in controlling expressions; their definitions are needed to determine whether those expressions are invariant under the arguments supplied by the target."
