  "explanation": "- MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: the prototype/declaration is required to see the exact parameter types and const-qualification for each argument (especially realm and opaque). The MISRA rule check depends on whether this callee expects const-qualified pointers or non-const pointers (i.e. whether passing const char * into it would discard const).\\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: the constant/enum definition is needed to confirm its type (enum vs pointer) so it cannot be mistaken for a pointer-related issue; it verifies the last argument is not a pointer that would affect const-pointer analysis.\\n- struct MHD_Connection: the full type declaration is needed to determine whether connection could/should be a pointer-to-const (and whether any conversions would discard const) when forwarded to the callee.\\n- struct MHD_Response: likewise, the definition/typedef is required to decide if response should be const-qualified and to check whether passing a (non-)const pointer to the callee discards const qualification."
