  "explanation": "_MHD_EXTERN: The function uses this macro as part of its declaration. It may expand to compiler-specific linkage or attribute annotations (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec) which are explicit language extensions \u2014 must inspect the macro definition.\n\nMHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: The target simply forwards its call to this function. Its prototype/definition may carry compiler-specific attributes (noreturn, calling-convention, visibility, __attribute__ or __declspec) or other extensions that would make the call site rely on language extensions \u2014 the callee declaration/definition must be inspected.\n\nMHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: The constant passed as the last argument may be a macro or enum value with a nonstandard definition (e.g. use of integer suffixes, macros that expand to attribute-bearing tokens). Check its definition to ensure no extensions are used.\n\nenum MHD_Result: The return type must be checked to ensure its declaration uses only standard C (no compiler-specific enum extensions or attributes attached to the type).\n\nstruct MHD_Connection and struct MHD_Response: The parameter types could carry attributes or nonstandard declarations (structure attributes, packed/aligned extensions, or bit-field/implementation-defined constructs). Inspect their definitions to confirm no compiler extensions are used."
