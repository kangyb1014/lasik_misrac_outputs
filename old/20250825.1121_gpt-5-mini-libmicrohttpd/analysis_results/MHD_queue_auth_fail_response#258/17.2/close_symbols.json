  "explanation": "- MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2: This is the direct callee of the target function. To determine if the target function participates in a direct or indirect self-call (recursion), you must examine MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2's body and its callee chain to see whether it (directly or transitively) calls MHD_queue_auth_fail_response.\n- MHD_queue_auth_required_response3: This function is a callee of MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 (per the static call graph). It must be inspected because it could call back to MHD_queue_auth_fail_response (or to other functions that eventually do), forming an indirect recursion cycle.\n\nNote: __builtin_unreachable is present in the call graph for MHD_queue_auth_fail_response2 but is a compiler builtin that does not introduce call edges relevant to recursion analysis, so it need not be included as a close symbol for this MISRA rule check. If either listed function calls other functions, those additional callees would also have to be included and inspected transitively to prove absence of indirect self-calls."
