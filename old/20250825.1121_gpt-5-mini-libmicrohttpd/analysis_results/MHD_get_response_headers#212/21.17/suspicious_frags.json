  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns uses of <string.h> functions that may access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by pointer parameters. In the provided code there are no direct calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.), so there are no other direct sites to inspect for this rule. The only locations that can lead to out-of-bounds string handling are: (1) the call-site that hands out pos->header and pos->value to an external callback (iterator), because that external code may use string functions on those pointers; and (2) the declarations of the header/value buffers and their associated sizes (header_size, value_size), because they indicate buffer lengths and whether the buffers are NUL-terminated is unknown. All other fragments in the provided code do not invoke or provide buffers to string.h functions and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 based on the supplied source."
