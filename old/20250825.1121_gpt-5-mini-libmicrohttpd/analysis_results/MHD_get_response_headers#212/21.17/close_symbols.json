This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to determine whether this function can violate the <string.h> bounds rule:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The target iterates response->first_header. You must see the definition to know the type and layout of first_header (pointer type, ownership, lifetime) and to determine whether accessing that member could lead to out-of-bounds access of contained strings.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: This is crucial. The function dereferences pos->header and pos->value (and pos->next and pos->kind). You need the exact field types (e.g. char *, const char *, array, length fields) and any related invariants (null-termination, buffer sizes, stored length fields) to decide whether passing these pointers to string.h functions could result in accesses beyond their bounds.\n\n- MHD_KeyValueIterator (typedef / function-pointer signature): The iterator is invoked with iterator_cls, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value. You must know the parameter types (are header/value declared as const char *, char *, or some other type) and calling convention so you can determine whether the iterator is expected to read strings and whether such reads could violate bounds. Also the typedef tells you whether iterator can modify the strings (which affects whether strcpy/strncpy/etc. could be invoked on them).\n\n- MHD_NO: The code compares the iterator return to MHD_NO. You need the definition of MHD_NO and the iterator return domain to understand control flow (early break) and whether an iterator could be invoked in cases that lead to out-of-bounds use.\n\n- All concrete iterator functions that may be passed at runtime: The target itself does not call string.h functions, but any iterator implementation supplied at runtime could. To determine if the overall behavior (during iteration) violates the string.h bounds rule you must examine the actual iterator implementations that will receive pos->header/pos->value to see whether they call memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc. on those pointers and whether they respect the buffers' extents.\n\n- Any functions/macros that create/populate/modify MHD_HTTP_Res_Header->header and ->value: To judge whether string.h calls are safe you need to know how the header/value buffers are allocated, their sizes, whether they are null-terminated, and whether lengths are tracked. These creation/modification routines establish the invariants (buffer lengths, ownership) required to verify that subsequent string.h uses are within bounds.\n\nIn short: to verify the MISRA string-bounds rule you must inspect the header struct layout and the provenance and usages of the header/value pointers (their allocation and any iterator implementations). The symbols above provide the definitions and code paths necessary to perform that analysis."
