  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Response: The target function reads response->first_header. You must see the definition of this struct to confirm the type and layout of first_header and ensure it points to MHD_HTTP_Res_Header nodes.\n\n2) struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: The function dereferences pos->header and pos->value and follows pos->next. You need this struct's definition to determine the exact types of header and value (e.g. char * null-terminated strings vs. binary buffers with explicit lengths) and the next pointer type used in the loop. Whether header/value are NUL-terminated is essential to decide if memcmp would be an inappropriate string-compare.\n\n3) MHD_KeyValueIterator (typedef/signature): The function calls iterator(iterator_cls, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value). You need the iterator function-pointer type and parameter types to know how header/value are passed to callers (pointer types, const qualifiers, any length parameters). This tells you whether iterator implementations are expected to receive NUL-terminated strings or binary data.\n\n4) MHD_NO: The code checks for (MHD_NO == iterator(...)). Knowing the definition/type of MHD_NO (and related return semantics) is needed to identify all iterator implementations that can halt the loop and to correctly match semantics when inspecting those implementations for forbidden memcmp usage.\n\n5) All functions that implement / are assignable to MHD_KeyValueIterator (iterator implementations): The target function itself does not call memcmp, it merely forwards header/value to the iterator. To determine a MISRA memcmp violation you must inspect every possible iterator implementation that can be passed here to see whether it uses memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings. Therefore you need the source/definitions of all functions matching the MHD_KeyValueIterator signature (and any wrappers that forward to them).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether header/value are NUL-terminated strings and whether any callees reachable from this function use memcmp to compare them (the MISRA C rule violation of interest)."
