  "explanation": "You must inspect the listed symbols because each can hide or expand to compiler-specific language extensions that would cause a MISRA violation for the rule \u201cLanguage extensions should not be used\u201d. Explaination for each:\n\n- _MHD_EXTERN (macro/definition): This macro prefixes the function definition. It may expand to compiler-specific storage-class or visibility annotations (for example __attribute__((...)), __declspec(...), or other non-standard tokens). The exact expansion must be inspected to determine whether any compiler extension is used.\n\n- MHD_KeyValueIterator (typedef / function-pointer prototype): The iterator parameter is a function-pointer type; its typedef may include non\u2011standard features (variadic parameters, K&R style declaration, attributes on the function type, calling-convention specifiers, or other extensions). You need the typedef to check whether its declaration uses any language extensions.\n\n- MHD_NO (macro or enum): This constant could be defined via a macro that uses extension syntax or via an enum/typedef declared with compiler attributes. Inspecting its definition ensures it does not rely on non-standard constructs.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition): The code references response->first_header. The struct definition may itself use non-standard extensions (anonymous structs/unions, unnamed bit-fields, flexible array members in a non-standard manner, attributes, or compiler-specific pragmas). You must see its definition to detect such extensions.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (definition): The loop iterates the linked-list nodes and accesses fields pos->next, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value. The struct field declarations could employ language extensions (e.g., bit-field widths using non-standard types, anonymous/unnamed members, attribute annotations, unusual array declarations). The full struct definition is needed to detect any extension usage.\n\n(Other symbols used in the function such as NULL and void are standard C and need not be inspected for compiler extensions in typical code; the items above are the ones that can legitimately hide target-specific or compiler-specific extensions.)"
