  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_response_headers can call itself (directly or indirectly) we must inspect any functions that it can invoke from inside the loop. The iterator parameter is a function pointer: its typedef (MHD_KeyValueIterator) is required so we know the precise prototype and whether it is permitted to call MHD_get_response_headers. The actual implementations that can be passed as that iterator must be examined (their definitions/names) because any of them might call MHD_get_response_headers (indirect recursion) or call other functions that form a recursion cycle. All callers of MHD_get_response_headers must be inspected because they determine which iterator functions (or iterator_cls values) are passed in at call sites and thereby reveal possible recursion chains. The MHD_NO constant is required to understand the control flow (early break) but also to identify which iterator return values are checked. The struct definitions for MHD_Response and MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (including the next pointer and any fields that could themselves be function pointers or carry references to functions) are needed to ensure there are no hidden function-pointer fields in the structures that could be invoked and cause recursion. Finally, any global/static variables that hold function pointers used as iterators and the concrete types/contents of iterator_cls must be inspected because they may indirectly contain references to MHD_get_response_headers. Examining these symbols (typedef, callback implementations, callers, struct defs, globals, iterator_cls contents) is sufficient to detect direct self-calls and any indirect recursion chains involving this function."
