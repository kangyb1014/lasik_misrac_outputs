  "explanation": "No other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they do not perform function calls (direct or via function pointers). The loop control and list traversal (for (pos = response->first_header; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)), the counter increment (numHeaders++), the local declarations, and the return statement do not invoke functions and therefore cannot introduce direct or indirect self-calls. The only potential source of indirect recursion is the callback function pointer passed as the parameter 'iterator' and its invocation; that is why the function signature (which declares the callback) and the callback invocation are reported."
