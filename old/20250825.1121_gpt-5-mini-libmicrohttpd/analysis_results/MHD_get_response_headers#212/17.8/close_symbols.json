  "explanation": "struct MHD_Response: needed to know the type and name of the member first_header (its type and whether accessing it is a read or could be a macro/side\u2011effecting expression). This shows whether the pointer parameter 'response' itself is being modified or only its pointee is accessed. struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: required to inspect the fields accessed (next, kind, header, value) and their types (especially next) to ensure the function only reads these fields and does not assign to the response pointer or to the parameter variables. MHD_KeyValueIterator: the typedef/signature for the iterator parameter (is it a function pointer, what are its parameter types and return type) is required to determine that calling iterator(...) does not modify the iterator parameter itself and to check whether the call could be a macro or something that assigns to the iterator parameter. MHD_NO: the constant/macro used in the comparison must be known (its type and expansion) to ensure the comparison is a plain value comparison and that using it does not expand to code that could modify a parameter."
