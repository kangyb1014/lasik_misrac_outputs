  "explanation": "struct MHD_Response: required to know the type/definition of response->first_header (is it a pointer, a macro, can it alias, or have unusual attributes) so the analyzer can determine whether the loop can be entered or is statically impossible. struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: required to know the definition of the 'next' field (type, pointer semantics, possible attributes) and other fields used (kind, header, value) to reason about loop progression and whether traversal can ever terminate (affects reachability of code after the loop). MHD_KeyValueIterator: the typedef/prototype (return type and any function attributes such as noreturn) is needed to determine whether the iterator call can return normally or can be annotated to never return (which would make code after the call unreachable) and to confirm the call is well\u2011formed. MHD_NO: the constant/enum value used in the comparison is required to interpret the iterator result check (what values cause the break) and whether that branch can be taken; its definition may also affect compile\u2011time constant propagation used by a static unreachable\u2011code analysis."
