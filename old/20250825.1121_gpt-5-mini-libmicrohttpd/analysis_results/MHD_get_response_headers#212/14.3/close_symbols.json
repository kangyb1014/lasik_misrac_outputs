  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Response \u2014 needed to see the exact type and qualifiers of response->first_header (e.g. whether it is a pointer, whether it is qualified volatile or const). The for-loop initialiser pos = response->first_header and the loop termination depend on that field; qualifiers or an unusual type could make the controlling expression invariant or behave specially.\n\n2) struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header \u2014 needed to inspect the definition of the 'next' member (its type and qualifiers) and other fields accessed (kind, header, value). The loop advances via pos = pos->next; whether the loop-controlling expression (NULL != pos) can change depends on the type/qualifiers of next and whether next can be modified by called code. Knowing these members is required to decide if the loop condition is truly variable.\n\n3) MHD_KeyValueIterator \u2014 the typedef/signature of the callback is required to determine what the iterator function can legally modify (do its parameter types allow modifying list structures?) and whether the invocation iterator(iterator_cls, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value) can have side effects that affect the loop-controlling expression (for example by changing pos->next or response->first_header). The callback prototype also shows whether iterator can be NULL and how its return type maps to MHD_NO.\n\n4) MHD_NO \u2014 the definition (macro/enum/constant and its type) is needed to determine whether the comparison (MHD_NO == iterator(...)) is a comparison against a constant value and whether that comparison can be invariant. Knowing the actual value/type also helps decide if the result of the comparison can be an essentially constant controlling value.\n\n5) NULL \u2014 the definition/type of NULL (macro) can affect comparisons (e.g. pointer vs integer) in some analysis frameworks. Including it ensures the analyzer treats 'NULL != pos' and 'NULL != iterator' correctly when deciding if those controlling expressions are invariant.\n\nNote: the above symbols (and the actual callback implementation/contract if available) are necessary to determine whether any of the loop or selection controlling expressions are truly invariant in practice (for example if pos/next are immutable or if the callback cannot/does not modify the list), or whether side effects can change them across iterations."
