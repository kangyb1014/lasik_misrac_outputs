In MHD_get_response_headers it is only read (passed to the iterator) rather than modified, so it should be declared 'const char *header;'. Declaring it as plain 'char *' when the pointed-to data is effectively immutable violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, the implementation actually modifies the header contents, then the current declaration is justified and no violation occurs.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_response_headers:\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header\n{\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * The name of the header (key), without the colon.\n   */\n  char *header;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a header, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t header_size;\n\n  /**\n   * The value of the header.\n   */\n  char *value;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a value, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t value_size;\n\n  /**\n   * Type of the value.\n   */\n  enum MHD_ValueKind kind;\n\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is speculative and not provable from the supplied snippet. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 indeed recommends that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever the pointed-to object is not modified, but whether a violation exists depends on the overall use and ownership of the struct members. In the provided code MHD_get_response_headers only reads pos->header and pos->value (passing them to an iterator), which could allow those members to be const, but there is no evidence here that they are never modified elsewhere or that the public API / callers would accept a const qualification. Converting the struct members to const would be an API/ABI change and can only be judged safe if the rest of the codebase and callers do not modify them. Also, passing a char * to a function taking const char * (if the iterator expects const) is allowed in C, so the local usage does not by itself violate MISRA. Therefore, based on the given information, the report is not correct \u2014 there is insufficient evidence to conclude a definite MISRA 8.13 violation."
