Given that response->data is declared as const char *, data_iov should similarly be a pointer to a const-qualified type (const MHD_iovec_ *) to express and enforce immutability. The lack of const on data_iov therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_response_headers:\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header\n{\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * The name of the header (key), without the colon.\n   */\n  char *header;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a header, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t header_size;\n\n  /**\n   * The value of the header.\n   */\n  char *value;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a value, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t value_size;\n\n  /**\n   * Type of the value.\n   */\n  enum MHD_ValueKind kind;\n\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the evidence. Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to be to a const-qualified type when it is safe/possible to do so, i.e. when the pointed-to object is never modified by the implementation. The snippet for MHD_get_response_headers does not reference data_iov at all, and the provided struct shows data_iov declared as MHD_iovec_ * but gives no information whether the implementation ever modifies the iovec elements (e.g. adjusting iov_base/iov_len as bytes are sent) or whether API compatibility requires a non-const type. If the implementation does modify the iovec contents, the non-const declaration is correct and no 8.13 violation exists. If the implementation never modifies the iovec elements, then changing the field to const MHD_iovec_ * would satisfy 8.13. Given only the shown code, there is insufficient evidence that data_iov is immutable, so the agent\u2019s claim of a MISRA 8.13 violation is not justified. To resolve for sure, inspect all uses of response->data_iov to see whether MHD writes to the pointed objects; if not, make it const, otherwise keep as-is."
