If the header value is not intended to be modified (as suggested by usage in MHD_get_response_headers where it is passed to an iterator for read-only inspection), this should be declared 'const char *value;'. Leaving it as 'char *' therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_response_headers:\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header\n{\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * The name of the header (key), without the colon.\n   */\n  char *header;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a header, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t header_size;\n\n  /**\n   * The value of the header.\n   */\n  char *value;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a value, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t value_size;\n\n  /**\n   * Type of the value.\n   */\n  enum MHD_ValueKind kind;\n\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim is not provably correct based on the information given. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 indeed encourages pointer types to be const-qualified when the pointee is never modified, but whether header and value should be const depends on the wider API and implementation. The provided function only reads the fields and passes them to an iterator, which is a read-only usage, but that single use does not prove the fields are never modified elsewhere. The struct members are declared as char * in the additional code \u2014 this may be intentional because other code may modify or reallocate those strings or because the public API was designed for mutable strings. To demonstrate a MISRA violation you must show that the pointed-to objects are never modified anywhere in the program (or that the API contracts require them to be immutable) and therefore should be declared const; absent that evidence the report is not justified. If, after project-wide review, the header/value truly are never modified, then changing them to const char * (and updating any APIs that accept non-const) would satisfy Rule 8.13."
