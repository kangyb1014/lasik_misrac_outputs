  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Agent A conflates different symbols (the MHD_get_response_headers parameter iterator_cls and the MHD_Response field crc_cls) and offers no evidence that the closures are actually treated as read\u2011only. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is a guidance to prefer const where an object is not modified, but whether a pointer can be const depends on the API contract: if the callbacks (content reader / free callback or the key/value iterator) expect a void * closure because they may modify or pass it to APIs that take non\u2011const, or for ABI/API compatibility, the pointer must remain non\u2011const. In the shown code MHD_get_response_headers merely forwards iterator_cls to the iterator callback; the function itself does not modify the pointed object but that does not prove the callback won\u2019t. Without the callback/type definitions and documentation proving the closure is strictly read\u2011only, you cannot conclude a violation. Even if the closure is only read, changing a public API from void * to const void * can be an incompatible change. Therefore there is insufficient basis to claim a MISRA 8.13 violation in the given code\u2014report is false."
