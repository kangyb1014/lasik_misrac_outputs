According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, nodep should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible (i.e. be declared as 'struct MHD_IPCount * const *nodep' to indicate the pointed-at pointer is not modified). The current declaration therefore violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. In this function nodep is only used to read the pointer stored in the tree (nodep = (struct MHD_IPCount **)tsearch(...); keyp = *nodep;) and the code never writes through *nodep. Therefore the inner pointer could be declared const (i.e. struct MHD_IPCount * const *nodep) to express that *nodep is not modified via nodep. That would satisfy Rule 8.13 while still allowing modification of the pointed-to struct via keyp. Note: you must take care with the tsearch cast and other MISRA rules about conversions (casts to pointer types), but that does not negate that the current declaration misses an opportunity to add const and thus violates Rule 8.13."
