  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: \n- The parameter 'const struct sockaddr_storage *addr' is already const-qualified. \n- 'newkeyp' is written to by MHD_ip_addr_to_key (it is an output buffer), so it cannot be const. \n- 'keyp' is subsequently used to modify keyp->count, so its pointee cannot be const. \n- The 'daemon' pointer is used with functions that may modify daemon state (e.g. MHD_get_master, MHD_ip_count_lock/unlock), so it cannot be made to point to a const-qualified type. \n- Calls to free() operate on dynamically allocated, non-const memory and must remain non-const. \nTherefore these other fragments do not indicate potential violations of Rule 8.13 and need not be investigated further."
