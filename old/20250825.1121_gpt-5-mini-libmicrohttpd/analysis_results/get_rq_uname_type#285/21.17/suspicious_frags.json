  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appears in this function. The code only performs NULL pointer checks on params->username.value.str and params->username_ext.value.str and compares params->username_ext.value.len to a constant; it does not perform any string or memory copy/concatenation/length operations that could access beyond referenced object bounds. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Note: if other parts of the codebase use these pointers with string.h functions, those usages should be reviewed separately \u2014 they are outside the scope of this function.)"
