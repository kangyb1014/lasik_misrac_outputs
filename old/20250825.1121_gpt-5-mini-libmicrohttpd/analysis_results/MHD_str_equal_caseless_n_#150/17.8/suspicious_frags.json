  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasoning: the function parameters are: 'const char *const str1', 'const char *const str2', and 'size_t maxlen'. The pointer parameters are declared with the second 'const', so the pointer itself cannot be assigned to within the function. The function does not assign to str1, str2, or maxlen anywhere. Indexing (str1[i], str2[i]) only reads the pointed-to objects and does not modify the pointer variables. The local variables 'c1' and 'c2' are copies (const char) and are not modifications of parameters. Called helpers 'charsequalcaseless' and 'isasciiupper' take char parameters by value (no pointer parameters) and therefore cannot modify the function's parameters. No casts or assignments to the parameters appear. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
