  "explanation": "I selected all conditional returns and the helper functions that implement the character-equality logic because unreachable code related to Rule 2.1 is most likely to appear in branches and return points or in helper functions that could make some branches impossible. Specifically: the check for c2 == 0 and its immediate return, the branch that continues versus the else return 0, and the final return ! 0; these are the control-flow points where parts of the function might be unreachable depending on the helper logic or on assumptions about the inputs. The helper functions charsequalcaseless and isasciiupper are included because their implementations determine which branches in the caller can actually be taken; if their logic makes some caller branches impossible, that would create unreachable code in the caller.\n\nOther fragments were not selected because they are simple, directly reachable control constructs or declarations: the for-loop header and the local variable declarations are necessary control structures and not themselves unreachable code; the character-load expressions (const char c1 = str1[i]; const char c2 = str2[i];) are executed each iteration and are not intrinsically unreachable; there are no other isolated return statements or dead statements in the provided code beyond the items listed above. If further context (e.g. guaranteed properties of inputs or other compile-time constants/macros) is available, additional fragments might become suspicious, but based on the supplied code these are the locations that require investigation for possible unreachable code."
