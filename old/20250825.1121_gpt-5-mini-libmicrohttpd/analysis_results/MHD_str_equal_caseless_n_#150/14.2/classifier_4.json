  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_:\n```c\nint\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (const char *const str1,\n                           const char *const str2,\n                           size_t maxlen)\n{\n  size_t i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < maxlen; ++i)\n  {\n    const char c1 = str1[i];\n    const char c2 = str2[i];\n    if (0 == c2)\n      return 0 == c1;\n    if (charsequalcaseless (c1, c2))\n      continue;\n    else\n      return 0;\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (charsequalcaseless (c1, c2))\n      continue;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment does not violate Rule 14.2. The for header is: for (i = 0; i < maxlen; ++i) \u2014 the first clause initializes the single loop counter i, the second clause tests i < maxlen (no persistent side effects and uses only the loop counter), and the third clause increments only i. The body fragment if (charsequalcaseless(c1, c2)) continue; calls a function with local const char arguments and executes continue; it does not modify the loop counter i nor any object used in the for-clauses. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated. (Note: if charsequalcaseless had hidden side effects that modified i or objects used in the for-clauses, that would constitute a violation, but no such evidence is present in this snippet.)"
