The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide if the for loop in MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ is well-formed per MISRA, we must examine any functions called from inside the loop body and any types used by the loop control. Specifically:\n\n- charsequalcaseless (definition/prototype and body): The loop body calls charsequalcaseless(c1,c2). MISRA requires that the behaviour of the for-loop body (including any functions called) not modify the loop counter or any object used in the loop test/step. You must inspect charsequalcaseless to ensure it has no persistent side effects (does not modify 'i', 'maxlen', or other objects used in the loop-clause), does not alter the strings pointed to by str1/str2 in a way that affects the loop condition, and does not introduce additional loop counters or control flags. Also check its parameter types to confirm it receives plain char values (no hidden pointer that could alter loop state).\n\n- isasciiupper (definition/prototype and body or macro expansion): The static call graph shows charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper. Because the behaviour of called functions is transitive for MISRA consideration, you must inspect isasciiupper to ensure it has no side effects that could modify the loop counter or other objects used in the loop clause(s). If isasciiupper is implemented as a macro, its expansion must be examined for side effects.\n\n- size_t typedef (e.g. <stddef.h>): The loop counter 'i' is declared as size_t and the loop termination uses 'maxlen' (size_t). To verify that the first clause initializes an integer loop counter and the third clause modifies only that counter, you should confirm size_t is an integer type on the target platform (as required by MISRA for loop counters) and that its signedness/width do not introduce undefined behaviour in comparisons/increment. Including the typedef/header ensures the type semantics are clear.\n\nOnly these symbols are required to decide compliance for the shown for-loop: they let you determine whether there are side effects in called functions or hidden modifications to the loop counter/objects used in the loop clauses. If other functions or globals are referenced inside charsequalcaseless or isasciiupper, those should be added as further close symbols after inspecting those bodies."
