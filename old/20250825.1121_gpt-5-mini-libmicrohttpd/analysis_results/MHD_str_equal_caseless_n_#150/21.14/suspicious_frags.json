  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ performs character-by-character comparison in a loop and explicitly checks for the NUL terminator (if (0 == c2) ...), so it does not rely on memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The helper charsequalcaseless and isasciiupper are inline functions that perform per-character checks and also do not call memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need to be investigated for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
