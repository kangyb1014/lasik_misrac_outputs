  "explanation": "I found no explicit uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no occurrences of common compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or compiler-specific keywords like __inline__ or __extension__.\n- The code uses only standard C constructs: function definitions, const-qualified pointers, size_t, for loops, char variables, comparisons, and return expressions. The use of bool is a standard C99/_Bool facility when stdbool.h or an equivalent typedef is provided; it is not itself a compiler extension.\n- The identifier _MHD_static_inline is a macro-like token in the snippets for the helper functions; its expansion is not shown. Because its definition is not present in the supplied code, I cannot assume it expands to a compiler-specific extension. If that macro expands to a compiler-specific extension (for example, a nonstandard inline form or an attribute), that expansion should be inspected \u2014 but the macro definition must be provided to make such a determination.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied snippets that clearly use language extensions per compiler documentation. If you can provide the definition of _MHD_static_inline or any project headers/macros, I can re-check those for possible compiler-specific extensions."
