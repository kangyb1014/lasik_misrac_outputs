  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or built-ins such as __attribute__, __asm, __inline__ (as a compiler extension), __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__ or similar tokens.  \n- There is no inline assembly, no use of nonstandard token-pasting, no unnamed struct/union extensions, and no other known nonstandard constructs in the shown fragments.  \n- Pointer arithmetic, casts (e.g. (char *)&pp[1]), assignments inside conditions, standard library calls (strstr, strchr, strlen, malloc, memcpy) and the enum/struct usage are all standard C and not language extensions.\n\nOne caveat: I can only inspect the code you supplied. The macros and helper functions (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, try_match_header, MHD_* return values, etc.) are invoked here but their definitions are not shown. If any of those macro or function definitions expand to or rely on compiler-specific extensions, those definitions would need to be inspected. Based on the visible code alone, however, there are no explicit language extensions to report."
