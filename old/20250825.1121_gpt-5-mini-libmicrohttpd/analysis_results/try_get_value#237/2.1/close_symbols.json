  "explanation": "- strlen: used to compute klen. You must know its semantics (returns length of a NUL-terminated string) to reason about the subsequent indexing into spos (spos[klen]) and to determine whether those accesses and loop advancement are reachable or could provoke undefined behavior (affecting reachability of later code).\n- strstr: used in the loop condition to find occurrences of key in buf. Its semantics (returns a pointer to the first occurrence within the NUL-terminated haystack or NULL) determine whether the while loop body can be entered, how bpos/spos advance, and therefore whether code after/inside the loop is reachable.\n- strchr: used to find the closing '\"' after the opening quote. Its semantics determine whether the code path that computes vlen, calls malloc, memcpy, and the success return can be reached, or whether the function returns early (unreachable code analysis depends on this).\n- malloc: used to allocate *destination. Knowing that malloc can return NULL (and does not longjmp or otherwise abort execution) is necessary to reason about the branch that handles out-of-memory and the reachability of code following a successful allocation.\n- memcpy: used to copy the value into the allocated buffer. Knowing memcpy's behavior (no longjmp, copies exactly the requested bytes) is required to determine if the copy and the subsequent return (success path) are reachable.\n- process_multipart_headers: the caller of try_get_value. To determine whether some early returns (e.g., the immediate return when *destination != NULL) or other branches are ever taken in real use, the calling context (how buf, key, and destination are supplied) must be inspected.\n- NULL: the macro is used in many comparisons; its definition/semantics (pointer NULL) is needed to interpret conditions like NULL != *destination or NULL != (spos = strstr(...)).\n- size_t: used for klen and vlen; its width and unsigned nature matter when reasoning about arithmetic (vlen computation, pointer differences) that affects reachability of subsequent statements.\n\nThese symbols (library routines and the immediate caller plus basic macros/types) are the minimal set required to determine whether any statements in try_get_value are unreachable under realistic semantics."
