  "explanation": "I inspected try_get_value and the caller process_multipart_headers for code that could be statically unreachable (dead code). I found no code fragments that are unreachable under any feasible control flow or data conditions. Rationale:\n\n- All return statements in try_get_value are reachable: the early return if *destination is non-NULL is reachable when the caller passes a non-NULL target; the \u2018\u2018not quoted\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018no end-quote\u2019\u2019 returns are reachable when the buffer contains a matched key that is not followed by a quoted value or lacks a closing quote; the \u2018\u2018out of memory\u2019\u2019 return is reachable if malloc returns NULL; the final \u2018\u2018success\u2019\u2019 return is reachable when a properly quoted value is found and allocated.\n\n- The while loop body is reachable whenever strstr finds an occurrence of the key; the continue path (no match) is reachable when a candidate occurrence fails the \u2018\u2018=\u2019\u2019/preceding-space checks.\n\n- Arithmetic that computes vlen yields at least 1 for valid quoted values (empty quoted value yields vlen==1), so the malloc/assignment/memcpy sequence is reachable and not bypassed by a logically impossible branch.\n\n- Falling off the end of the void function (no explicit return after the loop) is legal C and reachable when no matching key with a quoted value is found.\n\n- The caller only invokes try_get_value for Content-disposition headers; that makes the calls conditionally reachable, but does not render any code inside try_get_value unreachable.\n\nGiven these points, there are no fragments in the supplied code that appear to be unreachable and thus none need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
