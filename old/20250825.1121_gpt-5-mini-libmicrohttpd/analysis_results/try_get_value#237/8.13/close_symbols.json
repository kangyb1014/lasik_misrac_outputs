  "explanation": "strlen, strstr, strchr: their prototypes (in <string.h>) show whether they accept/return const-qualified pointers. In particular, standard C historically declares strstr/strchr returning char * (non-const) while taking const char * inputs; this affects whether assigning their return to const char * variables is const-correct for the MISRA rule.\n\nmalloc: its prototype (void *malloc(size_t)) shows it returns an unqualified pointer to mutable memory. Knowing this is required to judge whether the function is producing a mutable object (so destination being char ** may be appropriate) or should be a pointer-to-const.\n\nmemcpy: its prototype (void *memcpy(void *, const void *, size_t)) documents that the source is const-qualified and destination is mutable; this is central to deciding whether the copied buffer must be mutable (char *) or could be const char * for MISRA purposes.\n\nsize_t and NULL: standard definitions/macros are needed to interpret types/expressions used (e.g., malloc argument type, NULL comparisons) when checking pointer const-qualification and conversions.\n\nprocess_multipart_headers: the caller's declaration and usage of the destination argument (the exact type of the variable passed as the second/third argument and how the caller subsequently uses or modifies *destination) are required to determine whether try_get_value's use of char ** is appropriate or whether the pointer could/should be const-qualified. The caller's code may mandate a mutable buffer (so char ** is correct) or may treat the result as immutable (indicating a potential need for const qualification)."
