  "explanation": "To determine whether try_get_value participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine the other functions that appear in its static call graph component: \n\n- process_multipart_headers: Direct caller of try_get_value. Inspect its implementation to see if it (or functions it calls) can be (directly or indirectly) called back from try_get_value (i.e. form a mutual recursion cycle).\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: A callee of process_multipart_headers. Included so the analysis can determine whether any calls originating in try_get_value could reach back to process_multipart_headers via calls through this routine (and thus create an indirect recursion).\n- try_match_header: Another callee of process_multipart_headers; likewise must be checked for any call paths that could lead back to try_get_value (mutual/indirect recursion).\n- post_process_multipart: Caller of process_multipart_headers. Included so longer call chains outside the immediate caller can be examined for cycles that might involve try_get_value (e.g. post_process_multipart -> process_multipart_headers -> ... -> try_get_value -> ... -> post_process_multipart).\n\nIn short, checking these symbols (and any functions they call) is necessary to establish whether any call path exists that starts from try_get_value and eventually returns to it (directly or indirectly), which would violate the MISRA rule against self/indirect calls."
