  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is needed to determine whether try_get_value modifies its pointer parameters (the pointer variables themselves) or only the objects they point to, as required by the MISRA rule:\n\n- strlen: prototype shows it takes a const char * and does not modify the buffer or the pointer parameter; needed to confirm calls to it do not modify the parameter 'key' or 'buf'.\n\n- strstr: prototype (const char *haystack, const char *needle) documents that it takes const pointers and does not modify the inputs; needed to ensure its use cannot modify 'buf' or 'key' (or the local pointer variables derived from them).\n\n- strchr: prototype (const char *s, int c) similarly documents non-modifying behavior; required to confirm searching for the end-quote does not modify function parameters.\n\n- malloc: its prototype/semantics are needed to confirm that the call *destination = malloc(vlen) allocates memory and writes to *destination (the object pointed to) but is not modifying the pointer parameter variable destination itself except by storing into the pointed-to object (which is allowed by MISRA).\n\n- memcpy: prototype (void *dest, const void *src, size_t n) is required to verify that memcpy modifies the memory pointed to by *destination (the pointee) and does not modify the pointer parameter variable destination itself.\n\n- NULL: macro definition is needed to interpret the comparisons (NULL != *destination, NULL == (endv = strchr(...))), to ensure pointer/null checks do not imply modification of the parameter pointer variables.\n\n- size_t: type definition is required to understand the types used for lengths (klen, vlen) and to ensure there are no implicit conversions that could hide pointer modifications.\n\nThese symbols (their prototypes/definitions) allow verification that no called function or macro can reassign the function parameter variables (buf, key, destination) themselves; only the objects they point to are written (*destination), which is permitted by the rule."
