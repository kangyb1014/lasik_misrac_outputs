  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is modified in this function. The only write that affects a parameter is assignment to *destination (\"*destination = malloc (vlen);\") and writes into the memory pointed to by *destination (memcpy and setting the terminator). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted; the prohibition is on modifying the pointer parameter itself. There are no assignments to the parameter variables destination, buf, or key (no \"destination = ...\", no pointer arithmetic on those parameters), and buf/key are const and not modified. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate Rule 17.8 to report."
