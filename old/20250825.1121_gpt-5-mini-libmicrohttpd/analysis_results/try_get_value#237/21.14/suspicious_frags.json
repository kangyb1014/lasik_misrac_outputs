  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp in the provided code. The functions present that operate on strings are strlen, strstr, strchr and memcpy; none of these violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). The code also performs direct character checks (e.g. spos[klen] != '=', spos[-1] != ' '), which are not memcmp calls. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
