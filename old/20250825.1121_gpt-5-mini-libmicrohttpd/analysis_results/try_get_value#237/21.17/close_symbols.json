  "explanation": "Explain why each is needed for MISRA C array-bounds analysis of try_get_value:\n\n- strlen (string.h): used to compute klen. Its precondition is that key is a NUL-terminated string; any violation (non-terminated key) could cause out-of-bounds reads.\n\n- strstr (string.h): used to locate occurrences of key inside buf. strstr requires both arguments to be NUL-terminated and only returns pointers within the buf object; its semantics determine whether spos points into buf and whether searching can read past buf.\n\n- strchr (string.h): used to find the closing quote starting from &spos[klen+2]. strchr requires a NUL-terminated input; correctness guarantees that endv points within buf and that the search does not read past buf.\n\n- memcpy (string.h): used to copy value bytes into the allocated destination. Analysis must ensure the source range (&spos[klen+2] .. endv-1) and the destination range ([0 .. vlen-1]) are both valid for the requested copy length (vlen-1) to avoid out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- malloc (stdlib.h): allocation size uses vlen. MISRA analysis needs malloc semantics (including behavior for size 0, return value NULL) to determine whether the subsequent writes (*destination)[vlen-1] = '\\0' and memcpy are valid.\n\n- NULL macro / pointer comparison semantics: the code checks NULL != *destination and tests NULL == (endv = ...). Correct interpretation of NULL and pointer comparisons is needed to reason about early returns and whether dereferences are safe.\n\n- Properties of buf and key (null-terminated C strings within a single accessible object): the safe use of strlen/strstr/strchr and pointer arithmetic depends on buf and key being NUL-terminated and residing in accessible contiguous storage; also strstr/strchr behavior and pointer differences are only valid if these preconditions hold.\n\n- destination (char **): the caller must provide a valid pointer to a char* object (so the function can read *destination and later store the malloc result). After malloc, the returned memory must be writable of size vlen. Analysis must confirm the function does not write beyond the allocated size.\n\n- Pointer subtraction semantics (endv - spos) / pointer arithmetic rules: vlen is computed from (endv - spos) and klen; pointer subtraction is defined only when both pointers point into the same array/object. To ensure vlen is a meaningful size and that memcpy copies the correct number of bytes without overrunning source or destination, the analyzer must verify endv and spos are pointers into the same buffer (buf).\n\nThese symbols and preconditions are required to determine whether the string-handling calls and the subsequent memcpy/memory writes can access memory beyond the bounds of the referenced objects, per the MISRA rule."
