  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in MHD_poll_all that are obvious candidates for Rule 8.13 (i.e. pointers that could/should be const-qualified but are not). Rationale for not flagging pointer uses in this function:\n\n- Declaration and use of 'struct MHD_Connection *pos' and 'struct MHD_Connection *prev': these pointers are used to traverse and manipulate the daemon connection lists and are passed to call_handlers and other functions that may modify the pointed-to MHD_Connection objects (and some code paths move/remove list nodes). They therefore must be non-const.\n\n- 'struct pollfd *p': this buffer is allocated and written to (events fields set) and later read/modified by the poll implementation (revents), so it cannot be const.\n\n- Conditional 'struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh' and '*urhn' (when HTTPS/UPGRADE_SUPPORT enabled): these variables are used both for read-only traversal in some loops and for processing that can change the upgrade handle / associated connection state (process_urh, MHD_connection_finish_forward_, MHD_resume_connection etc.). Because the same identifiers are used across those code paths and the upgrade handle state may be modified, they must remain non-const.\n\n- Pointer parameter 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' of MHD_poll_all: the function reads and writes multiple daemon members (e.g. data_already_pending, resuming flags, calling functions that modify daemon state). Thus it must be a non-const pointer.\n\n- Calls to system/library APIs and internal helpers: many functions/macros used here (poll, accept/accept4, read via MHD_itc_clear_, MHD_sys_poll_, MHD_accept_connection(), new_connections_list_process_(), call_handlers(), MHD_itc_r_fd_(), urh_to_pollfd/urh_from_pollfd, etc.) expect non-const pointers because they either write into provided buffers or mutate the pointed-to objects. For example, MHD_strerror_ expands to strerror(), which returns char * by standard C; this is a library API type and cannot be treated as const here.\n\nGiven the above, none of the pointer usages in the provided MHD_poll_all implementation appear to be incorrectly un-const-qualified in a way that violates MISRA C Rule 8.13. If you want, I can re-check any specific pointer declaration or call site in more detail (or inspect related functions such as urh_to_pollfd/urh_from_pollfd, call_handlers, or any other helper) to confirm whether their parameter types could/should be changed to const."
