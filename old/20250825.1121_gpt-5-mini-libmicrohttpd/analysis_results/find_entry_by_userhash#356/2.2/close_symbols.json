  "explanation": "For determining whether code in find_entry_by_userhash is dead (i.e. executed but removable without affecting program behaviour), the next analyser needs the following symbols and why each is required:\n\n- enum MHD_DigestAuthAlgo3\n  - To know the defined / permitted enum constants and their numeric values (MD5, MD5_SESSION, SHA256, SHA256_SESSION, SHA512_256, SHA512_256_SESSION, INVALID, etc.). This is required to decide whether particular switch cases are ever possible (reachable) or are impossible by construction \u2014 a key factor in deciding dead code.\n\n- MHD_digest_get_hash_size\n  - The target function calls this to validate userhash_size. The analyser must know its behaviour/implementation (or contract) to see which sizes are returned for which enum values and whether the initial size check can ever pass or fail for values that reach this function.\n\n- digest_get_hash_size\n  - MHD_digest_get_hash_size calls this (per the static call graph). The concrete mapping from enum values to numeric hash sizes often lives here; the analyser needs it to determine whether the subsequent sizeof(...) checks and switch branches are meaningful or redundant (potentially dead).\n\n- struct UserEntry\n  - Required to know the layout and exact sizes of fields userhash_md5, userhash_sha256, userhash_sha512_256 used in sizeof(...) and memcmp. If those fields have sizes that never match values returned by MHD_digest_get_hash_size, then the loops/branches may be dead.\n\n- user_ids\n  - The array of UserEntry objects: analyser must know its definition and length (number of elements). If user_ids is an empty array or length 0, all for-loops are no-ops and the loop bodies (including memcmp and return entry) would be dead code. If it is statically sized but only contains sentinel entries, that can also affect reachability/necessity of code.\n\n- find_entry_by_userinfo\n  - The only recorded caller of find_entry_by_userhash. To determine if find_entry_by_userhash is ever invoked with certain algo3 values (or ever invoked at all), the analyser must inspect the caller to see how algo3 is derived and which call-sites reach this function. Dead-code determination depends on whether a branch/path is ever taken from callers.\n\n- handle_sec_areas_req\n  - The caller of find_entry_by_userinfo (per the call graph). To fully trace whether particular call chains that reach find_entry_by_userhash exist in the built program, the analyser needs to follow the chain up to an entry point that is actually used (e.g. request handling). This helps decide if some branches in find_entry_by_userhash are unreachable in the running program and thus candidates for dead code removal.\n\n- find_entry_by_username\n  - Called by find_entry_by_userinfo; include it because find_entry_by_userinfo may choose between username-based and userhash-based lookup depending on input or configuration. Understanding that decision logic is necessary to know whether find_entry_by_userhash is ever used (and under what conditions), which affects dead-code status of its internal branches.\n\nNote: Standard library memcmp itself does not need to be listed \u2014 its semantics are assumed. The analyser should examine the listed symbols to determine whether the switch cases, size checks, loops and memcmp calls are ever executed in any valid program configuration; if they are executed but their removal would not change behaviour, they are dead code per MISRA."
