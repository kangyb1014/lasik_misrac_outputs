True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local pointer 'entry' is declared as 'struct UserEntry *entry' and assigned from 'user_ids + i'. Within the function 'entry' is only used to read fields (passed to memcmp) and then returned. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible (e.g. 'const struct UserEntry *entry'), and the function should return a const-qualified pointer if callers do not need to modify the entry. As written, using a non-const target for a pointer that is only used for reading violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 asks that pointer types be const-qualified when that is feasible without changing the observable semantics or API. In this function the local variable entry is assigned from the array user_ids and then returned from the function. The function's declared return type is ``struct UserEntry *`` (a non-const pointer). Declaring the local variable as ``const struct UserEntry *entry`` would make its type incompatible with the function return type (or force an explicit cast to drop const), so you cannot unilaterally make it const without changing the API or performing a cast (the latter would itself be undesirable and could violate other MISRA constraints). Because the pointer is returned as a non-const pointer, it is not possible to make it point to a const-qualified type under the current API, and thus the claim that this is a Rule 8.13 violation is not justified based on the shown code. If callers do not need to modify the returned entry, the correct remediation is to change the function signature to return ``const struct UserEntry *`` (and then make local pointers const) \u2014 otherwise the code as written is acceptable with respect to Rule 8.13."
