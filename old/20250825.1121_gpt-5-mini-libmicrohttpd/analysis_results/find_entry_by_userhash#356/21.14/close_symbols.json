  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for the MISRA C check (memcmp vs null-terminated strings):\n\n- struct UserEntry (definition): needed to determine the exact types and sizes of members userhash_md5, userhash_sha256, userhash_sha512_256 (e.g. whether they are fixed-length byte arrays or char pointers). If these members are fixed-size binary buffers (unsigned char[] or uint8_t[]), memcmp is appropriate; if they are char[] intended as NUL-terminated C-strings, then memcmp could violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- user_ids (array definition): required to confirm the number of entries and, together with sizeof checks in the function, to verify that the code is comparing fixed-size buffers rather than string data. The code uses sizeof(user_ids[0]) and sizeof(user_ids) so the actual declarations matter.\n\n- find_entry_by_userinfo (caller): required to see how the userhash and userhash_size arguments are produced and passed in practice. If the caller constructs a binary hash buffer and supplies its explicit length, memcmp is not comparing NUL-terminated strings. If the caller passes a C-string pointer or length computed from strlen, that would indicate a potential MISRA violation.\n\n- find_entry_by_username (caller of find_entry_by_userinfo): included because the caller chain may generate or influence the form of the userhash (e.g. by computing or formatting it). Inspecting this function helps determine the origin and semantics of the data passed to find_entry_by_userhash.\n\n- MHD_digest_get_hash_size (implementation): the target function calls this to validate userhash_size. The implementation shows what sizes are expected for each algorithm and helps confirm that the code enforces binary hash lengths rather than string lengths.\n\n- digest_get_hash_size (implementation): included because MHD_digest_get_hash_size calls it (per static call graph). Examining it ensures the returned sizes are the hash byte lengths and that the size checks performed in find_entry_by_userhash are meaningful.\n\n- memcmp (declaration / prototype): include to be explicit about the function semantics (it compares raw bytes, not C-string semantics). While the standard behaviour is known, having the declaration helps static-analysis tools and confirms no wrapper or macro changes memcmp behavior in this build.\n\n- enum MHD_DigestAuthAlgo3 and MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_* constants: necessary to understand which algorithm values are used and to map them to expected hash sizes; aids interpretation of the size checks and which member (userhash_md5, userhash_sha256, etc.) is compared for a given algorithm.\n\nIn short: to determine whether memcmp in find_entry_by_userhash is being used to compare null-terminated strings (MISRA violation) you must inspect the data layout (struct UserEntry, user_ids), the origin and construction of userhash (caller functions), and the concrete hash sizes returned by the digest-size functions; memcmp's semantics are also relevant to the conclusion."
