  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.14 concerns use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In the provided function the only uses of memcmp are the three fragments listed above; these are the only locations that could potentially violate the rule. Other code constructs (size checks using sizeof and MHD_digest_get_hash_size, the switch statement, returns, and loop control) do not call memcmp and therefore cannot directly violate Rule 21.14. The size checks preceding each memcmp also indicate the intent to compare fixed-size hash buffers rather than C strings, but the memcmp calls themselves should be investigated to confirm that the buffers compared are not null-terminated strings."
