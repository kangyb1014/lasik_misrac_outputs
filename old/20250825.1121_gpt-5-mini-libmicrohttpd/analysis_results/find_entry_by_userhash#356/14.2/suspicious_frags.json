  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The only constructs that are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 in this function are the three for loops shown above; they should be inspected to confirm compliance. Other fragments do not need investigation for this rule because:\n- The loop counter i is declared as size_t and the first clause (i = 0) clearly sets the loop counter (or initializes it), satisfying clause 1.\n- The second clause uses i and a compile-time constant expression (sizeof(user_ids)/sizeof(user_ids[0])), which has no persistent side effects and does not reference any object modified in the loop body; therefore it meets clause 2.\n- The third clause (++i) modifies only the loop counter and nothing else, meeting clause 3.\n- The loop body does not modify the loop counter i, and there is only one loop counter per loop. The pointer assignment and the call to memcmp do not introduce persistent side effects that affect the loop clauses (memcmp is not expected to modify its operand buffers). Thus other parts of the function (the sizeof checks, switch, return NULL, variable declarations) are not relevant to Rule 14.2 and do not require further investigation for that rule."
