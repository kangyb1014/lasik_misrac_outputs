  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the provided function is invariant. Reasoning by control construct:\n\n- The switch statement: switch (algo3) \u2014 algo3 is a function parameter (variable at runtime), so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- if (MHD_digest_get_hash_size (algo3) != userhash_size): the expression involves a function call and a parameter, so it is not a compile-time invariant.\n\n- The for loops: for (i = 0; i < (sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])); ++i)\n  Although (sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0])) is a compile-time constant, the controlling expression includes the loop variable i (i < constant), so it is not invariant \u2014 i changes each iteration and the loop terminates when i reaches the constant bound. This does not violate Rule 14.3.\n\n- The other if checks (comparing sizeof(...) with userhash_size) compare a compile-time sizeof with a runtime parameter (userhash_size), so they are not invariant.\n\n- The memcmp result comparisons (0 == memcmp(...)) depend on runtime data and are not invariant.\n\n- There are no while, do-while or for constructs with a constant boolean/always-true controlling expression (e.g., while(1) or for(;;)) nor an invariant conditional that would cause an infinite loop or a no-op branch. The allowed exceptions (intended infinite loops or the do-while integer-constant false pattern) do not apply.\n\nTherefore, no code fragments need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 based on the supplied function."
