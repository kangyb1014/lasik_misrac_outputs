  "explanation": "\u2022 try_ready_chunked_body (definition / call-site): The caller's source is required to see the actual expression or variable passed as the buf parameter. MISRA\u2019s const-pointer guidance depends on whether the callee actually needs to modify the object; that is determined by how the buffer is created/used at the call-site.\\n\\n\u2022 declaration(s) of the object(s) passed as the 'buf' argument in try_ready_chunked_body (the buffer variable(s)): We must inspect the buffer\u2019s own declaration (its type and const-qualification) to know whether the object is inherently mutable or already const-qualified. If the object is declared const, passing it to a function taking a non-const char * would be a violation.\\n\\n\u2022 MHD_pool_get_free (prototype/definition): If the buffer is obtained from a pool, the pool allocation API\u2019s return type (char * vs const char *) and its semantics determine whether the buffer is intended to be modifiable. The function signature/documentation will show whether returned pointers should be const-qualified.\\n\\n\u2022 MHD_pool_reallocate (prototype/definition): Similar to MHD_pool_get_free, reallocation APIs influence whether a pointer is owned/mutable. The prototype/signature shows the constness of returned/accepted pointers.\\n\\n\u2022 prototype/declaration of MHD_uint32_to_strx as seen by callers (header): The declaration used by callers must match the definition; if callers include a different prototype (e.g., with const on buf) that affects whether a const mismatch exists.\\n\\n\u2022 typedefs / headers for size_t and uint32_t (e.g., <stddef.h>, <stdint.h>): These standard type declarations are needed to be certain no unusual typedefs alter types involved (not typically affecting constness of buf, but required to fully understand parameter types)."
