  "explanation": "No pointers in this function can reasonably be made to point to const-qualified types. The only pointer in the code is the parameter \"char *buf\", which is written to (buf[o_pos++] = ...), so it must be a pointer to non-const; making it const would be incorrect. There are no other pointer variables, pointer returns, or implicit pointer uses that could be const-qualified. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
