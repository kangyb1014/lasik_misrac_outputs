  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_uint32_to_strx participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine callers and any callee chains that could lead back to it. Each listed symbol is needed for that reachability/cycle analysis:\n\n- try_ready_chunked_body: direct caller of MHD_uint32_to_strx; any cycle must include or be reachable from this function, so its body and call sites must be inspected.\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle: caller of try_ready_chunked_body; upward call paths from here could eventually lead back to MHD_uint32_to_strx, so its implementation and callers must be checked for cycles.\n- MHD_pool_get_free: callee of try_ready_chunked_body; if this (or routines it calls) can call back into try_ready_chunked_body or MHD_uint32_to_strx, an indirect recursion would exist\u2014so its definition must be analyzed.\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: callee of try_ready_chunked_body; same reason as MHD_pool_get_free\u2014its call graph must be inspected for paths back to the target.\n- connection_close_error: callee of try_ready_chunked_body; include to verify it does not (directly or indirectly) call the target or its callers.\n- __builtin_unreachable: present in the callee list of try_ready_chunked_body; include for completeness (it is a compiler builtin and cannot cause calls back, but listing it documents that this path cannot introduce recursion).\n\nOnly by examining these functions (their bodies and further callees/callers) can you conclude whether any call-return path leads from MHD_uint32_to_strx back to itself (directly or indirectly), which would violate the MISRA rule."
