The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- try_ready_chunked_body: This function is the direct caller of MHD_uint32_to_strx (per the call graph). To determine if any for-loop that includes a call to MHD_uint32_to_strx complies with the MISRA rule, you must inspect try_ready_chunked_body for for-loops and whether those loops call MHD_uint32_to_strx in their bodies (the rule counts behaviour of functions called from the for body). Also check whether the loop counters or objects used in loop clauses are modified by calls within the body.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle: This is the caller of try_ready_chunked_body. A for-loop in this higher-level caller could include try_ready_chunked_body (or call chains that eventually call MHD_uint32_to_strx). The full caller context is needed to see whether any for-loops span into the call chain and whether loop counters or clause objects are modified by called functions.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: Called by try_ready_chunked_body (per the graph). If try_ready_chunked_body contains a for-loop that calls MHD_pool_get_free (or calls it indirectly), you must inspect MHD_pool_get_free for side effects that could modify loop counters or objects used in the for-clause (MISRA forbids such side effects via called functions).\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: Same rationale as MHD_pool_get_free \u2014 it is called by try_ready_chunked_body and could perform side effects (memory/pointer updates) that influence loop counters or objects named in the for clauses. Its behaviour must be known to judge compliance.\n\n- connection_close_error: Also called by try_ready_chunked_body; its side effects (flags, connection state, globals) could affect loop control expressions or objects used in loop clauses; include it for analysis of any for-loops in the caller chain.\n\n- __builtin_unreachable: Present in the call graph from try_ready_chunked_body. Though a compiler builtin, its presence may affect control-flow reasoning in a for-loop (e.g., unreachable paths, loop termination assumptions). Include it to ensure correct control-flow interpretation when verifying the well-formedness of any for statements in the calling context.\n\nNotes: MHD_uint32_to_strx itself contains no for-loops (it uses do/while and while). The MISRA rule concerns for-loops and also requires examining functions called from for-loop bodies for side effects. Therefore the close symbols are the caller(s) and the callees of those callers (per the static graph) whose behaviour could modify loop counters or objects used in for clauses. If further depth is needed (other callers/callees not in the provided graph), include their source as well."
