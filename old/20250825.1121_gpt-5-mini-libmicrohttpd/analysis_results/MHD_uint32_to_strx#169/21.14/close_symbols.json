  "explanation": "- try_ready_chunked_body: This is the direct caller of MHD_uint32_to_strx. To decide whether memcmp is (improperly) used to compare a NUL\u2011terminated string produced (or expected) by MHD_uint32_to_strx we must inspect the caller\u2019s use of the buf pointer and the function\u2019s return value (whether the caller treats the result as a NUL\u2011terminated C string or uses the length). The caller\u2019s code determines whether any memcmp calls operate on null\u2011terminated strings originating from this function.\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule in question explicitly concerns uses of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. You must find and inspect all memcmp invocations (signatures and call sites) reachable from the caller to determine whether their arguments are null\u2011terminated strings (which would violate the rule).\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: If the caller obtains the buffer passed into MHD_uint32_to_strx from a pool allocator, the allocation routine and how the buffer is obtained/initialized affect whether a NUL terminator is appended or present. Inspecting this symbol (and its usage in the caller) shows the buffer size and initialization state.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: Similarly, reallocation calls in the caller can change buffer sizes and whether space for a trailing NUL is reserved. To know whether callers later pass a NUL\u2011terminated string to memcmp you must check any reallocation logic.\n\n- connection_close_error: Included because the caller calls this on error paths; some code paths might pass the buffer to other routines or compare it during error handling. Inspecting this symbol and related error\u2011path code ensures no hidden memcmp usage on null\u2011terminated data.\n\nNote: __builtin_unreachable is irrelevant for this MISRA rule check (it does not affect string comparisons), so it is omitted. The primary focus is on locating memcmp call sites and inspecting the caller(s) that prepare/own the buffer returned by MHD_uint32_to_strx to determine whether those memcmp calls operate on NUL\u2011terminated strings."
