  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is invariant. The loops/conditions to check: \n- do { ... } while ((0 == digit) && (0 != digit_pos)); \u2014 the operands change each iteration: 'digit' is recomputed from 'val' (which is left-shifted every iteration) and 'digit_pos' is decremented before the test, so the controlling expression is variant.\n- while (o_pos < buf_size) \u2014 'o_pos' is incremented inside the loop, so the expression is variant.\n- if (0 == digit_pos) \u2014 'digit_pos' is modified earlier in the loop, so this conditional is not an invariant controlling expression.\nNone of the loops are unconditional infinite loops (which would be an allowed exception), nor are there any constant Boolean/invariant controlling expressions, so no fragments need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
