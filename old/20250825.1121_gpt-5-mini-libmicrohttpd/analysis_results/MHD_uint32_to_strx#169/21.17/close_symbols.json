  "explanation": "- try_ready_chunked_body: This is the direct caller that supplies the buf and buf_size arguments. You must inspect its call site to see what pointers and sizes are passed, whether they can be NULL, and whether buf_size really reflects the allocated extent of buf.\\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle: Caller of try_ready_chunked_body. Tracing up the call chain can reveal allocation/ownership and lifetime properties that affect whether the buf argument is valid and sized correctly when MHD_uint32_to_strx is invoked.\\n- MHD_pool_get_free: try_ready_chunked_body may obtain buffers from this pool allocator; you need its semantics (returned pointer, guaranteed usable size, alignment, possible reserved headers) to determine the true bounds of buf.\\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: If try_ready_chunked_body can reallocate or resize buffers before calling MHD_uint32_to_strx, you must inspect this to know the actual available size and whether buf_size passed matches the allocated extent.\\n- the actual buffer and buf_size objects/variables passed at the call site in try_ready_chunked_body: The names/definitions (struct fields or local variables) and any invariants or checks performed on them are required to determine whether the writes in MHD_uint32_to_strx can exceed the object bounds.\\n- typedefs for size_t and uint32_t (stddef.h/stdint.h): To be precise about sizes and ranges used in calculations and loop limits, ensure the concrete definitions used in the build (e.g. width of size_t) are known.\\n\\nRationale: The MISRA rule in question concerns out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses stemming from string/buffer operations. Although MHD_uint32_to_strx does not call string.h functions, it writes into a caller-supplied buffer bounded by buf_size; therefore verifying compliance requires the caller/allocation sites and any reallocation primitives that determine the true allocated extent and validity of buf and buf_size."
