  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to the three clauses of a for statement (initialisation, condition, iteration) and to the use/modification of a single loop counter and any loop control flag in that for statement. The only loop in this function is a while loop; therefore there are no for-loop clauses or for-loop counters to inspect under Rule 14.2.\n\nAdditional relevant observations (not flagged as suspicious for Rule 14.2):\n- The function uses a while loop with index variables r and w that are modified in the loop body; Rule 14.2 does not apply to while loops. \n- No functions are called inside the loop body, so there are no implicit side effects from called functions to consider under the rule. \n\nBecause there are no for statements in the code, there are no code fragments that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
