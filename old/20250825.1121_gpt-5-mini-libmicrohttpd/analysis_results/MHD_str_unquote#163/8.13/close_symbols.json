  "explanation": "To check whether MHD_str_unquote complies with the MISRA rule that pointers should be const-qualified when possible, you must examine how MHD_str_unquote is used and what is passed into its pointer parameters. The following symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z: This direct caller may construct or forward the buffers/strings passed as quoted and result. You need its prototype and/or implementation to see the types (const or not) of the arguments it passes and whether it expects MHD_str_unquote to modify the buffer pointed to by result.\n\n- get_rq_nc: Another direct caller. Its code/signature will show how it prepares the quoted and result arguments (e.g., whether it passes pointers to mutable buffers or const data). This determines whether any pointer const-qualification in MHD_str_unquote is appropriate or would cause const-qualification loss.\n\n- get_unquoted_param: Direct caller that also calls get_buffer_for_size. You need its implementation/signature to see how it obtains the result buffer and whether that buffer is intended to be modified (so result must be non-const) or could have been const.\n\n- get_unquoted_param_copy: Same reason as get_unquoted_param \u2014 inspect how the result buffer is allocated/typed and what mutability is expected.\n\n- get_buffer_for_size: Both get_unquoted_param* call this to obtain a buffer. Its prototype/implementation reveals whether it returns (and therefore callers receive) a mutable char* buffer or some other pointer type (const char*), which is central to deciding if MHD_str_unquote's result parameter should be const-qualified.\n\nExamining these symbols (their declarations and the call sites/implementations) lets you determine if any pointer parameter in MHD_str_unquote could or should be const-qualified without breaking callers or causing const-qualification loss."
