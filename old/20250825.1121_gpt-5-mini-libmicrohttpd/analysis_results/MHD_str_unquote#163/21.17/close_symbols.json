  "explanation": "To decide whether MHD_str_unquote can write beyond the result buffer (MISRA rule about out\u2011of\u2011bounds string operations) the analyzer needs the callers/allocation sites that determine the sizes passed in and the buffer that receives the unquoted data:\n\n- get_unquoted_param\n  - This function calls get_buffer_for_size and then MHD_str_unquote. Its implementation will show how quoted, quoted_len and the result buffer are derived and whether the allocated result buffer is sized to hold the unquoted output (including any needed NUL terminator).\n\n- get_unquoted_param_copy\n  - Same reason as get_unquoted_param; it calls get_buffer_for_size and MHD_str_unquote. The copy variant may allocate differently or add termination; its code is required to confirm safe sizing.\n\n- get_buffer_for_size\n  - This is the allocator/resizer used by the above callers. You must inspect how it computes and returns buffer sizes (requested size vs. actually allocated) to verify that result has at least quoted_len bytes (or quoted_len+1 if a terminator is required). If it under-allocates, MHD_str_unquote can write out of bounds.\n\n- get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z\n  - This is a direct caller of MHD_str_unquote. The _z suffix suggests it may zero-terminate or handle lengths specially; its code will show whether it allocates/passes a sufficiently large result buffer and how it computes quoted_len.\n\n- get_rq_nc\n  - Another direct caller that computes and passes quoted and quoted_len. You need its implementation to confirm quoted_len accurately bounds the quoted input and to see how the result buffer is provided/allocated.\n\nIn short: MHD_str_unquote itself only writes result[w++] up to at most quoted_len bytes (it removes backslashes so output length <= input length), but whether that is safe depends entirely on how callers compute quoted_len and allocate/size result. The listed symbols are the functions that allocate or propagate those sizes and therefore are necessary to determine compliance with the MISRA string-bounds rule."
