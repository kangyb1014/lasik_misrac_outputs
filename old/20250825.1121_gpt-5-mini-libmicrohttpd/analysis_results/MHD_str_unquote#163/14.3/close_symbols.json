  "explanation": "Short rationale for each symbol (why it is needed to judge whether the while(quoted_len > r) controlling expression can be invariant):\n\n- get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z: This function directly calls MHD_str_unquote. To determine whether the loop condition can be invariant at the call site (e.g. quoted_len is a constant 0 or other constant value, or a value that causes wrap/never-changing behaviour), we must see how this caller computes/passes quoted_len and the quoted pointer.\n\n- get_rq_nc: Direct caller of MHD_str_unquote. Its implementation may produce quoted_len (or the related length argument) from parsing logic; we must inspect it to know whether quoted_len can be a compile-time/constant or pathological value (0, SIZE_MAX, etc.) that would make the while condition invariant or cause overflow/wrap issues.\n\n- get_unquoted_param and get_unquoted_param_copy: Both directly call MHD_str_unquote (and both call get_buffer_for_size). They determine the buffer/length passed into MHD_str_unquote; we need their code to know how quoted_len is derived and whether it can be invariant at the loop entry.\n\n- get_buffer_for_size: Called by the two get_unquoted_* callers to compute/allocate sizes. It may impose size limits, roundings or return constant sizes; that affects whether quoted_len is effectively invariant or could produce values that might cause r to wrap or the condition to be constant.\n\n- MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_: Used by get_rq_nc (per the static graph). It participates in converting string fields to integer sizes/lengths; its behaviour (e.g. return value on overflow/invalid input) can influence the numeric value passed as quoted_len and thus whether the controlling expression is effectively invariant or can lead to overflow/wrap conditions.\n\nIn short: to assess MISRA C \"controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" for the while(quoted_len > r) condition, we must inspect all call sites and helper routines that compute or constrain the quoted_len argument (and any conversions that produce it). The listed symbols are the direct callers and the helper functions they use to produce the length/value passed into MHD_str_unquote; without them we cannot determine whether quoted_len might be a constant (or otherwise invariant) at runtime or produce edge cases (e.g. SIZE_MAX leading to unsigned wrap) that could make the loop condition effectively invariant."
