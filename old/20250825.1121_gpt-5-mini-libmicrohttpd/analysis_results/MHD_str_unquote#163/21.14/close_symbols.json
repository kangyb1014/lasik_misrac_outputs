  "explanation": "To decide whether MHD_str_unquote causes a MISRA violation about using memcmp on null-terminated strings you must inspect callers and any places that (a) turn the returned buffer into a C string (append a '\\0') or (b) compare the returned data with memcmp. The listed symbols are required for that analysis: \n\n- get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z: Direct caller that (by name) probably requests a NUL-terminated unquoted copy. Need to see whether it NUL-terminates the buffer returned by MHD_str_unquote or passes the raw buffer to memcmp/other comparators.\n- get_rq_nc: Direct caller; it may unquote and then compare/interpret the result (e.g. compare as a string or convert to integer). Inspect to see if memcmp is used on the unquoted data or if NUL-termination is added first.\n- get_unquoted_param and get_unquoted_param_copy: Direct callers that use get_buffer_for_size and MHD_str_unquote; must check whether they produce/expect NUL-terminated strings and whether they are later compared with memcmp.\n- get_buffer_for_size: Allocator/initializer used by the above callers \u2014 needed to see whether buffers are zeroed or a NUL terminator is put in place after unquoting.\n- MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_: A callee of get_rq_nc \u2014 included because callers might convert the unquoted result to numeric form rather than treating it as a NUL-terminated string; its presence affects whether memcmp/string compare is used.\n- MHD_digest_auth_get_request_info3 and get_rq_uname: Upstream callers of get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z/get_rq_nc. They are included because the eventual use site for the unquoted data (where memcmp might be invoked) could be further up the call chain.\n- digest_auth_check_all_inner: Upstream caller of get_unquoted_param/get_unquoted_param_copy; include to locate any memcmp usage that compares values returned from those helpers.\n- memcmp: The standard function named by the MISRA rule. You must inspect all occurrences of this symbol in the code reachable from the callers above to determine whether memcmp is ever used to compare NUL-terminated strings produced (or expected) by MHD_str_unquote.\n\nWith these symbols you can trace whether MHD_str_unquote ever results in a NUL-terminated C string being compared via memcmp (which would violate the rule), or whether callers correctly handle lengths or use safe comparison functions."
