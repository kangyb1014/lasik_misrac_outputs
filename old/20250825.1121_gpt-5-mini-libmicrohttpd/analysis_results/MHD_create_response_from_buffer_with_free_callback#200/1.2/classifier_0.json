  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment only contains the macro identifier _MHD_EXTERN, a struct type and a pointer declarator. There is no explicit compiler language extension present in this fragment. (If _MHD_EXTERN expands to a compiler-specific extension such as __declspec, __attribute__, etc., that expansion \u2014 not the fragment as shown \u2014 would violate Rule 1.2, but the fragment itself does not prove use of a documented language extension.)"
