  "explanation": "The only token that may indicate a compiler-specific extension is the macro _MHD_EXTERN; macros are often defined to compiler-specific storage-class/visibility attributes (for example __attribute__((...)) or __declspec(...)). Its expansion must be checked in the headers to determine if a language extension is used. All other constructs in the snippet are standard C: use of size_t, void *, a function-pointer typedef parameter, a normal function definition and a plain function call/return. No explicit GCC/MSVC attributes, inline assembly, typeof, __inline__, __extension__ or other known compiler extensions appear in the provided code fragment."
