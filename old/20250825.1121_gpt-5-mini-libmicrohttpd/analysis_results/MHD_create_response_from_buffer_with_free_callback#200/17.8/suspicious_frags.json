  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters (size, buffer, crfc) are only read and passed unchanged to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls; there are no assignments to any parameter, no increments/decrements, no pointer arithmetic or reassignments of the parameter variables. Passing the pointer value (buffer) as an additional argument does not modify the pointer parameter itself. The object pointed to by buffer may be affected by the callee or a callback (which is permitted by the rule), but that is outside the scope of this function and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 here."
