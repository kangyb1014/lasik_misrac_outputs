  "explanation": "I examined both provided functions (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback and MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls) and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any other string-comparison functions (strcmp, strncmp, etc.). The code performs pointer checks, size_t checks, memory allocation, mutex initialization, and stores buffer/size in a response struct, but does not compare null-terminated strings or call memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the supplied code."
