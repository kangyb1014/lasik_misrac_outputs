  "explanation": "The provided function contains no controlling statements (no if, switch, for, while, do-while, ?: operator, or similar). It only performs a return of a function call with four parameters. Rule 14.3 addresses invariant controlling expressions; since there are no control-flow expressions in this fragment, there is nothing to investigate for this rule. The use of the _MHD_EXTERN storage-class macro and passing the same buffer pointer twice are not controlling expressions and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 14.3. No infinite loops or constant do-while constructs are present."
