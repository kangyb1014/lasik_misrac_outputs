  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The buffer pointer is passed as both the data pointer and as the user context for the free-callback, implying ownership/transfer (the callback may free or otherwise mutate the object). Because the pointer is intended to be handed to a free callback (and thus cannot be const-qualified), using a non-const void * here is appropriate. (If in a different design the function never modified or freed the buffer, then the parameter should be const and the code would violate Rule 8.13.)"
