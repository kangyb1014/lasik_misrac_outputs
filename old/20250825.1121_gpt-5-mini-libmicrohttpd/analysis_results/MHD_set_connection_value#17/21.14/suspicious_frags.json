  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target function and the related definitions. No calls to the Standard Library function memcmp appear in the shown code. The fragments only use strlen (to obtain lengths), pointer assignments, and memory-pool allocation/reallocation functions (MHD_pool_*). There are no string comparisons performed with memcmp in the provided snippets. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If other source files or omitted parts (the '...') contain memcmp calls, those specific fragments would need to be checked, but they are not present in the supplied code.)"
