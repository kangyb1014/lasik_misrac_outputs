  "explanation": "The only pointer types in this fragment are 'struct MHD_Connection *connection', 'const char *key', and 'const char *value'. key and value are already const-qualified and are used only in read-only contexts (passed to strlen and forwarded as const), so they do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. The ternary NULL checks and strlen calls operate on const char * and are appropriate. The return type and enum parameter are not pointer types and are irrelevant to Rule 8.13. Therefore the only code that should be investigated is the non-const pointer to the connection object: it may or may not need to be const-qualified depending on whether the function (or the callee) modifies the connection; that should be checked."
