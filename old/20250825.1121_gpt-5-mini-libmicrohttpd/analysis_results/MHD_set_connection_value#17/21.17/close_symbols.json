This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- strlen: The target calls strlen(key) and strlen(value). To check MISRA <string.h> rule we must know strlen's behaviour (it reads until a NUL) and whether calling it here can read past the buffers referenced by key/value (i.e. whether those pointers are guaranteed NUL-terminated and valid).\\n- MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ (prototype/definition): The target forwards the pointers and the computed lengths to this function. We must inspect its implementation to see how it uses the pointer/length pair (it may call memcpy/strcpy/strncpy or otherwise assume a particular invariants). That determines whether computing lengths with strlen here is safe or could lead to out-of-bounds accesses later.\\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_: This function is called (directly or indirectly) by the nocheck function. If the nocheck implementation allocates and then copies data (memcpy/strcpy) into/from buffers allocated here, we need to see how lengths are used to detect possible OOB.\\n- struct MHD_Connection: The layout/ownership/lifetimes of connection fields may determine whether key/value point into connection-owned buffers, or whether destination buffers overlap with source, which affects safety of strlen and subsequent copy operations.\\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: The value kind may influence how nocheck handles the data (e.g. some kinds may treat values as binary blobs with explicit lengths vs NUL-terminated strings). Knowing this is needed to decide whether strlen is appropriate.\\n- MHD_set_connection_value_n: Another public wrapper that calls the nocheck variant; its usage patterns (how it computes/passes lengths) give insight into expected conventions for the nocheck API (NUL-terminated vs explicit-length data).\\n- parse_cookies_string and get_req_headers: These are other callers of the nocheck function (from the call graph). Inspecting how they pass pointer/length pairs (explicit lengths vs relying on NUL termination) reveals the intended contract of the nocheck function and therefore whether calling strlen in the target function respects that contract."
