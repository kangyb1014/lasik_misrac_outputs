  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_connection_value:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_set_connection_value (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                          enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                          const char *key,\n                          const char *value)\n{\n  return MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ (connection,\n                                              kind,\n                                              key,\n                                              NULL != key\n                                              ?

A violation would occur if mhd_assert is a no-op at runtime and the asserted expressions have no side\u2011effects and are always true \u2014 in that (hypothetical) case the executed checks could be removed without affecting program behaviour and would therefore be dead code."
