  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying a function parameter variable itself; modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed. Inspection of both functions shows no assignments to any parameter variables:\n\n- MHD_set_connection_value: does not assign to connection, kind, key, or value. It only computes lengths (via strlen) and passes values to the helper function.\n\n- MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_: the function assigns data into the newly allocated 'pos' structure (pos->header = key; pos->value = value; pos->header_size = key_size; pos->value_size = value_size; pos->kind = kind) and updates members of the object pointed to by 'connection' (connection->rq.headers_received, connection->rq.headers_received_tail and their ->next). These are modifications of the objects referred to by pointer parameters (permitted), not modifications of the pointer parameters themselves. There are no statements like connection = ..., key = ..., value = ..., kind = ..., key_size = ... or value_size = ... that would reassign parameter variables.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs further investigation under this rule."
