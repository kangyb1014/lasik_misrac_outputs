  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expressions (NULL != key and NULL != value) are invariant under MISRA C, we must know if those pointer parameters can ever be null (or are guaranteed non-null at the API level) and whether any annotations or macros force a non-null contract. Specifically:\n\n- declaration/prototype of MHD_set_connection_value (header): The header prototype may carry parameter annotations (or macro-expanded attributes) that declare key/value as non-null (or otherwise constrain them). Such annotations would make the controlling expressions always true and therefore invariant.\n\n- declaration/prototype of MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_: The called function\u2019s prototype may also carry non-null annotations or semantic contracts that imply key/value must be non-NULL prior to calling; knowing its parameter contracts helps determine whether the ternary tests are redundant/invariant.\n\n- definitions of attribute/annotation macros used in the function declaration (e.g. _MHD_EXTERN and any project nonnull/nonnull-param macros that expand to __attribute__((nonnull)) or similar): Many projects hide compiler attributes behind macros. You must inspect those macro definitions to see if they impose non-null guarantees (or other behavior) that would make the comparisons invariant.\n\n- definition of NULL (stddef.h or project override): Confirming the definition of NULL ensures the comparison is a pointer comparison with the expected semantics; while usually standard, a project could redefine NULL or provide alternative pointer sentinel macros that affect analysis.\n\n- declaration/prototype of MHD_set_connection_value_n (wrapper variant): Inspecting related APIs and wrappers can reveal whether callers consistently pass non-NULL arguments (or whether other wrappers annotate non-null), which is relevant to a whole-program determination of invariance.\n\n- declaration/prototype of parse_cookies_string and get_req_headers: These are other callers of the underlying _n_nocheck_ function (per the call graph). Examining their prototypes and call sites can show whether, in practice, key/value are always non-NULL when the lower-level function is invoked \u2014 evidence that the controlling expressions might be invariant in the deployed code paths.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine whether the NULL checks are genuinely conditional at runtime or rendered invariant by API contracts/annotations or by all call sites, which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions."
