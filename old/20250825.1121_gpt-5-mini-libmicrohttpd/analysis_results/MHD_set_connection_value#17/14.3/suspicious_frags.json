  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found. All controlling expressions in the provided code depend on runtime state or parameters:\n- The conditional expressions NULL != key and NULL != value (used in the ?: operator) depend on the function arguments key and value, so they are not invariant.\n- The if (NULL == pos) check depends on the return value of MHD_connection_alloc_memory_, which is runtime-dependent.\n- The if (NULL == connection->rq.headers_received_tail) check depends on the connection object state at runtime.\nThere are no loops or do-while constructs with constant controlling expressions, and no selection/iteration conditions are compile-time constants or otherwise invariant. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
