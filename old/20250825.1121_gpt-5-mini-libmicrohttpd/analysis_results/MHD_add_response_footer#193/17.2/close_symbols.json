  "explanation": "- add_response_entry: The target function returns the result of add_response_entry. To determine whether a recursion cycle exists that includes the target function, the body (or at least its call sites) of add_response_entry must be inspected. If add_response_entry calls the target or calls a function that eventually calls the target, that creates indirect recursion and violates the rule.\n- add_response_entry_n: The static call graph shows add_response_entry calls add_response_entry_n. You must examine add_response_entry_n (its definition and its callees) because any call chain starting here might lead back to add_response_entry or MHD_add_response_footer, producing indirect recursion.\n- all functions called (directly or indirectly) by add_response_entry_n: To prove absence (or presence) of indirect recursion you need the transitive closure of callees starting at add_response_entry_n. Any function in that closure that calls add_response_entry or MHD_add_response_footer (or otherwise forms a cycle back to the target) is relevant to the MISRA rule."
