  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the supplied functions. Reasoning:\n\n- MHD_add_response_footer is a trivial wrapper that always returns the result of add_response_entry; there is no code after the return, so there is no dead/unreachable statement in it.\n- add_response_entry has a single early return for the case content == NULL; all subsequent statements (strlen(header), strlen(content), and the call to add_response_entry_n) are reachable when content != NULL. There is no code following the final return that would be unreachable.\n- add_response_entry_n performs a sequence of input-validation checks (response == NULL, header_len == 0, content_len == 0, memchr checks) each of which can be exercised by appropriate inputs; none of these checks are constant or tautological, so their bodies and subsequent statements are reachable depending on runtime arguments. The memchr calls are correctly guarded by header_len/content_len checks, so there is no branch that is logically impossible due to prior conditions.\n\nNote: Although some inputs (for example header == NULL) would cause undefined behaviour (strlen on NULL), undefined behaviour is not the same as unreachable code under MISRA Rule 2.1; such issues were not requested to be reported here. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no fragments that qualify as unreachable code requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
