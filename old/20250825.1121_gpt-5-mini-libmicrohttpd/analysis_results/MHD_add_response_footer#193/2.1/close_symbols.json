  "explanation": "To decide whether MHD_add_response_footer is unreachable you must know (1) what it calls (to detect any indirect recursion or use that would affect reachability) and (2) who calls it or could call it (including external callers). - add_response_entry: the direct callee; inspect its body to ensure it does not call back to MHD_add_response_footer or otherwise change reachability (e.g. registers function pointers). - add_response_entry_n: next-level callee of add_response_entry; include to check for deeper cycles/back\u2011references that could make MHD_add_response_footer reachable. - callers of MHD_add_response_footer (all project-wide references): a complete list of functions/translation units that reference/call MHD_add_response_footer is required to determine if the function is ever invoked. The static call graph showed no callers, but you must confirm this across the whole project (including indirect calls via function pointers). - MHD_add_response_footer declaration / MHD_EXTERN (visibility/linkage): the declaration and the MHD_EXTERN macro determine external linkage/visibility; if the function is exported from the library it may be reachable from code outside the current translation units, so this affects whether it is considered unreachable in the project. - project symbol export / linker map (object-file symbol table): the linker-level symbol table or export list shows whether external modules (or dynamic loaders) can/are expected to call this symbol; required to decide reachability at the project/integration level."
