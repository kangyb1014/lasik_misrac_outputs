This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- add_response_entry: The target function is a thin wrapper that forwards footer and content to add_response_entry. You must inspect add_response_entry to see how those const char * arguments are used (copied, concatenated, measured, stored) and whether any <string.h> functions are called on them in a bounds-unsafe way.\n- add_response_entry_n: add_response_entry calls this lower-level routine (per the call graph). Any real string operations (strlen, memcpy, strcpy, strcat, etc.), length checks, or memory allocation logic that determine safety are likely performed here; it must be inspected to identify possible out-of-bounds accesses.\n- struct MHD_Response: The response structure likely contains buffers, length fields, or pointers where footer/content are stored or appended. You need its definition to determine destination object sizes and to check whether writes/concatenations into response fields can exceed their bounds.\n- MHD_FOOTER_KIND: This value is passed to add_response_entry and can change the handling (different code paths, different buffers or semantics). Its meaning may change whether data is copied, appended, or referenced; therefore its definition is required to follow the correct code path for bounds analysis.\n- MHD_Result: While not directly related to buffer safety, its definition and any associated error codes can reveal early-return/error-handling behavior in callees that affect whether potentially unsafe string operations execute. Including it ensures complete understanding of control flow relevant to safety checks."
