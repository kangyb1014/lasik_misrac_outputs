Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_add_response_footer:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_add_response_footer (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                         const char *footer,\n                         const char *content)\n{\n  return add_response_entry (response,\n                             MHD_FOOTER_KIND,\n                             footer,\n                             content);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_add_response_footer:\n#define _MHD_EXTERN __attribute__((visibility(\"default\")))extern\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_add_response_footer (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                         const char *footer,\n                         const char *content)\n{\n  return add_response_entry (response,\n                             MHD_FOOTER_KIND,\n                             footer,\n                             content);\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. MHD_add_response_footer is an externally visible API wrapper (extern with default visibility) that simply forwards to add_response_entry and returns its result. Rule 2.2 forbids operations that are executed yet could be removed without changing program behaviour; there is no evidence here that this function is executed and removable without effect. Therefore it cannot be classified as dead code from the fragment shown. (It would only be a Rule 2.2 violation if the function were actually executed in the program and its removal\u2014without replacing calls\u2014would not change any observable behaviour.)"
