  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_add_response_footer constitutes dead code under MISRA (i.e., an operation executed but removable without affecting behaviour) we must know whether the function is ever executed or potentially used by other translation units or external programs, and whether removing it changes observable behaviour. Each requested symbol/source is required for the following reasons:\n\n- _MHD_EXTERN: This macro controls linkage/visibility (e.g., extern, DLL export). If the function is exported from the library, it may be used by external callers (outside the analyzed build), so it cannot be assumed dead. Knowing its expansion is necessary to decide whether removal could affect external behaviour.\n\n- all call-sites and address-taken occurrences of MHD_add_response_footer (project-wide search): Static call graph here shows no callers, but MISRA requires establishing actual execution/use. You must locate every direct call and every occurrence where the address is taken (assigned to a function pointer). If the function is ever called or its address is stored for later invocation, it is executed and might not be dead.\n\n- linker/shared-library export symbol table for the built library (dynamic symbol table / version script): Even if the function has no callers inside the source tree, it may be exported from the shared library and used by external applications. The export list / dynamic symbol table or version script shows whether removal would break external consumers.\n\n- public header(s) that declare MHD_add_response_footer (prototype in .h files): Presence in public headers indicates an API contract; removal could break external code. The header(s) also show intended usage and may reveal inline/static differences.\n\n- add_response_entry (definition): The target simply forwards to add_response_entry. To judge whether the wrapper is necessary (or redundant), inspect add_response_entry for side-effects, unique behaviour, or requirements that the wrapper must satisfy. Also check whether add_response_entry is called elsewhere (via MHD_add_response_header etc.), which affects whether removal of the wrapper changes semantics.\n\n- MHD_add_response_header (definition and callers): This is another wrapper that calls add_response_entry (seen in the call graph). Comparing its usage and callers helps determine whether add_response_entry is relied upon through other public wrappers and whether the footer-specific wrapper serves a distinct role; it also helps ensure add_response_entry is not exclusively reachable via the footer wrapper.\n\n- any function-pointer registration tables or callback arrays that could store &MHD_add_response_footer (project-wide search): Functions may be referenced indirectly by storing their addresses in tables (e.g., handler registries). Such indirect references are not visible in a simple call graph. You must find those tables/registrations to determine potential execution.\n\n- MHD_FOOTER_KIND (macro/enum definition): The wrapper passes this constant to add_response_entry. Knowing its semantic meaning may reveal side-effects or conditional behaviour in add_response_entry that make the footer wrapper meaningful beyond a simple forwarder (affecting whether removal would change behaviour).\n\nCollecting these symbols and artifacts lets the next agent determine whether MHD_add_response_footer is ever executed, whether its removal would alter observable behaviour (including external consumers), and therefore whether it violates the MISRA dead-code constraint."
