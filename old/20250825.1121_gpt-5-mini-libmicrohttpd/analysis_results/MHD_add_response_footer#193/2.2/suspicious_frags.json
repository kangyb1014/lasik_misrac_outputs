The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only the two fragments shown in the provided inputs are present and potentially relevant to Rule 2.2. No other functions, statements, or definitions were supplied in the target or additional code, so there are no further code fragments to investigate here. The wrapper function is a one-line forwarder and could be dead code if it is never called; the macro that expands to an attribute plus extern modifies linkage/visibility and should be checked for effects on symbol resolution and whether the function is actually emitted/used. There is no other initialization-only code, unreachable-code patterns, or additional operations in the provided snippets that would require investigation for dead code under Rule 2.2."
