  "explanation": "- add_response_entry (function definition): The target function simply forwards to this function. To determine whether any controlling expression that is executed as a result of calling MHD_add_response_footer is invariant, you must inspect the body of add_response_entry for if/switch/for/while/do-while controlling expressions.\n- add_response_entry_n (function definition): The static call graph shows add_response_entry calls add_response_entry_n. Any invariant controlling expressions may live in that callee (or further callees), so its definition/body is required to fully analyze reachable controlling expressions.\n- MHD_FOOTER_KIND (macro / enum constant): This argument can change control flow inside the callees (e.g. switch/if on kind). Its value may make a controlling expression become a compile-time constant or select a code path with an invariant condition; therefore its definition is needed.\n- struct MHD_Response (type definition): The callees likely inspect fields of the response (e.g. response->flags, response->length) in their controlling expressions. You must see the struct members and their semantics to determine whether conditions using them are invariant.\n- enum MHD_Result (type / enum definition): Knowledge of this return-type enum is necessary to understand comparisons or constant-return patterns in the callees that might produce invariant controlling expressions.\n- Any global variables and macros referenced by add_response_entry / add_response_entry_n (names and definitions): Controlling expressions can depend on globals or macros (compile-time constants). To decide whether a controlling expression is invariant you must know the definitions/values of all globals and macros used in the reachable code paths.\n\nInclude the full source (bodies) of add_response_entry and add_response_entry_n plus the definitions listed above (MHD_FOOTER_KIND, struct MHD_Response, enum MHD_Result, and any globals/macros they use) so the next analyst can examine every controlling expression reachable from MHD_add_response_footer for MISRA C invariant-control violations."
