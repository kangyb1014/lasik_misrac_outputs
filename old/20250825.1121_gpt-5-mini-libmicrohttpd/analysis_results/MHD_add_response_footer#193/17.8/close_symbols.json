  "explanation": "- add_response_entry: the primary callee. If add_response_entry is a normal function, it cannot reassign the caller's parameter variables (C is pass-by-value). However, if add_response_entry is implemented as a macro (or expands to code that is inlined into the caller), that expansion could contain assignments to the parameter identifiers (e.g. response = ...) and thus would constitute modification of a function parameter in MHD_add_response_footer. You must inspect its declaration/definition or any macro definition.\n- MHD_FOOTER_KIND: this token is passed as an argument and could be a macro with side effects or a complex expansion. If it is a macro that expands into code that assigns to identifiers visible in the call site, it could cause parameter modification when the call is preprocessed. Confirm it is an innocuous constant/enum.\n- MHD_EXTERN: a source-level macro that prefixes the function declaration. Although unlikely, its expansion could change the function text (for example, be defined as a function-like macro in some configurations). Check its definition to be sure it does not introduce parameter-modifying code.\n- struct MHD_Response: the type of the response parameter. Knowing the actual type confirms whether the parameter is a pointer, array, or some unusual typedef that could affect what constitutes \"modifying the parameter\" (e.g. if a macro or typedef hides non-standard behavior).\n- enum MHD_Result: the return type; include its definition to fully understand any macros or inline expansions surrounding the return statement (and to ensure no hidden macro wrappers alter the call site).\n\nInspecting these symbols (especially whether add_response_entry is a macro vs a function and the definitions of any macros used in the call) is sufficient to determine whether MHD_add_response_footer itself modifies its parameters in violation of the MISRA rule."
