  "explanation": "1) add_response_entry \u2014 The target function is a thin wrapper that immediately calls add_response_entry; the body of add_response_entry must be inspected to see whether memcmp is used to compare footer or content (null\u2011terminated) strings.\n\n2) add_response_entry_n \u2014 add_response_entry calls add_response_entry_n (per the call graph). Any comparison of strings (including uses of memcmp) may occur there, so its implementation is required to determine rule violation.\n\n3) memcmp \u2014 The MISRA rule concerns use of the Standard Library memcmp for comparing null\u2011terminated strings. Any direct or indirect use must be identified; having the memcmp symbol (or its project wrappers) lets the analyzer find calls and check how the arguments are formed (null\u2011terminated or not).\n\n4) MHD_FOOTER_KIND \u2014 This constant/enum value selects the code path inside add_response_entry/add_response_entry_n. Knowing its value or meaning helps determine which fields of struct MHD_Response or which comparison logic apply to footers vs. other kinds.\n\n5) struct MHD_Response \u2014 The layout and types of the response fields (where footer/content are stored/referenced) are needed to determine whether the data compared with memcmp are null\u2011terminated C strings or non\u2011terminated buffers.\n\n6) MHD_add_response_header \u2014 This sibling caller of add_response_entry is listed in the call graph and can provide a second usage pattern (headers vs footers). Inspecting it may reveal whether the code uses memcmp for header/footer names/values and whether those uses operate on null\u2011terminated strings; this helps infer consistent behavior in add_response_entry."
