  "explanation": "_MHD_EXTERN: This macro/identifier controls the function linkage/storage-class and likely expands to compiler-specific keywords or attributes (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, extern \"C\", visibility attributes). You must inspect its definition to detect any compiler language extensions.\nenum MHD_Result: The return type may be an enum with non\u2011standard extensions (unnamed enumerators, extended underlying types, attributes on the enum) \u2014 check its definition for any compiler extensions.\nstruct MHD_Response: The parameter type may include non\u2011standard constructs (zero-length arrays, GCC flexible-array extensions, unnamed bit\u2011fields, attributes) that would violate the MISRA restriction \u2014 inspect its definition.\nadd_response_entry: The target forwards to this function; its prototype/definition may use compiler-specific function attributes or storage-class extensions (inline, __attribute__, __declspec, calling-convention keywords) that affect whether language extensions are used.\nadd_response_entry_n: Included because add_response_entry calls it (per call graph); add_response_entry may be a thin wrapper and the actual extension usage could be in add_response_entry_n \u2014 inspect it as part of the callee chain.\nMHD_FOOTER_KIND: This macro/constant passed as an argument could be defined using non\u2011standard constructs (macro tricks, GCC statement\u2011expressions, casts to extended types, or compiler specific values) \u2014 check its definition for extensions."
