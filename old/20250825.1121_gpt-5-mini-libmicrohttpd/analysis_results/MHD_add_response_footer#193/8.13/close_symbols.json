  "explanation": "add_response_entry: The target function simply forwards its pointer arguments to add_response_entry. To determine whether passing const char *footer and const char *content is allowed without discarding qualifiers (and therefore whether the code violates the MISRA requirement), the prototype and implementation of add_response_entry are required to see the parameter types (e.g. whether they are declared as const char * or plain char *). If add_response_entry takes non-const pointers, passing const pointers would discard const and be relevant to the rule.\n\nadd_response_entry_n: The static call graph shows add_response_entry delegates to add_response_entry_n. The downstream function may drop const qualifiers or perform modifications; its prototype/definition is needed to see whether const is preserved or discarded deeper in the call chain.\n\nstruct MHD_Response (definition): The first parameter is struct MHD_Response *response. To judge whether this pointer could/should be const-qualified (per MISRA guidance: pointers should be const whenever possible), the definition and uses of the type and how it is passed to add_response_entry/add_response_entry_n are needed to determine whether the object is modified.\n\nMHD_FOOTER_KIND (definition): The forwarded second argument is this constant (likely an enum or macro indicating the kind). Its type affects which add_response_entry overload/signature is used (if any) and is required to match the correct prototype of add_response_entry.\n\nenum MHD_Result (definition): While not a pointer, the return type is part of the function signature and useful to ensure no hidden conversion or wrapper changes pointer constness; include its definition to fully understand the function signatures involved when tracing const qualifiers."
