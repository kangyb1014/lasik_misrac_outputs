  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Rationale:\n\n- The only C-level conditional expressions in digest_reset are comparisons of the runtime field da->algo against enumeration constants (e.g. MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo). These depend on a non-constant struct member and therefore are not invariant.\n\n- All #ifdef / #else / #endif constructs are preprocessor directives (compile-time inclusion/exclusion), not C controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3.\n\n- The mhd_assert(...) uses are macros defined as ((void)0) in the provided configuration, so they do not introduce controlling expressions in the compiled code; the asserted expressions are not used to control flow at runtime in this build.\n\n- There are no loops (for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions in the function. The function does not create infinite loops (the allowed exception) nor use a do-while with an essentially Boolean constant control.\n\n- Calls and macros such as MHD_MD5_reset, MHD_SHA256_reset, and MHD_SHA512_256_init are function/macro invocations that do not create controlling expressions.\n\nTherefore no code fragments in the provided function appear to violate Rule 14.3 and nothing else needs to be investigated for this rule."
