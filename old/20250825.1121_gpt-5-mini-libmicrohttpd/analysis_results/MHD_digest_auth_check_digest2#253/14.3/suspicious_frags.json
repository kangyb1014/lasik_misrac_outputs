  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant. All conditional controls depend on either a function parameter or on the result of a function call:\n- The three initial if/else-if checks compare the parameter 'algo' against enum constants \u2014 'algo' is a function parameter and therefore not invariant.\n- The assignment to 'res' comes from the call to MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3; the subsequent if/else-if conditions compare 'res' to enum constants \u2014 'res' is not a compile-time constant but a runtime value returned from that call.\n- There are no loops (for/while/do-while) whose controlling expression is a constant; no do-while with a constant false is present either.\n- The final else that calls MHD_PANIC is reached only when 'algo' does not match the expected enum values; that branch does not contain an invariant controlling expression.\nBecause every controlling expression depends on runtime inputs or function results, there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 and thus no suspicious fragments to report."
