  "explanation": "1) MHD_bin_to_hex (declaration/prototype): Needed to see whether the called function is actually a simple C function or is implemented/declared using compiler extensions (for example a macro that expands to inline assembly, a varargs/wrapper using non-standard syntax, or a declaration annotated with compiler-specific attributes). Such attributes or non-standard signatures would be a language extension under the MISRA check. 2) Any macros/attributes used in the declaration of MHD_bin_to_hex or in function declarations: Many projects hide compiler-specific extensions behind macros (e.g. macros that expand to __attribute__((...)), __declspec(...), calling\u2011convention annotations, or other compiler-specific tokens). Those macro definitions are required to determine whether the code relies on language/compiler extensions. 3) The typedef/definition of size_t: Although size_t is standard, it is defined in headers and could be aliased in project headers; its definition ensures no non-standard typedef or compiler extension is being used in the function signature. 4) The header(s) included by the translation unit: File-level macros, pragmas or header inclusions can introduce extensions (e.g. #pragma, feature macros, or header-local macros that change syntax). Inspecting the relevant headers ensures there are no hidden language extensions affecting the target function."
