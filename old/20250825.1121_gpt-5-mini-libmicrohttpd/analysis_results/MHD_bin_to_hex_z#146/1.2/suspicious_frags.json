  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code. All constructs are standard C: function definition and return, use of standard type size_t, const void * parameter, call to another function (MHD_bin_to_hex), array indexing and assignment (hex[res] = 0) and a plain return. There are no compiler-extension tokens or idioms present (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, zero-length arrays, designated-extension initializers, or other compiler-specific keywords). The use of 0 to write the string terminator is standard C (equivalent to '\\0') and not an extension. Therefore no fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
