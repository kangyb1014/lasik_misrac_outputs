  "explanation": "MHD_bin_to_hex_z contains no control statements itself, so the only way an invariant controlling expression could appear in the compiled expansion of this function is if the call to MHD_bin_to_hex is a macro or an inline definition that expands into control statements. To determine compliance with the MISRA rule you must inspect MHD_bin_to_hex (its declaration and full definition or macro expansion). That will show whether any control constructs become part of MHD_bin_to_hex_z (and whether any of those controlling expressions are invariant)."
