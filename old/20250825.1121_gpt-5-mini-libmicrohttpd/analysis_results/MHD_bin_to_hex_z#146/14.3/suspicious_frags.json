  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. Details:\n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex_z contains no loops or conditional controlling expressions (just a call, assignment, and return), so Rule 14.3 is not applicable there.\n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex uses a for loop: for (i = 0; i < size; ++i). The controlling expression i < size depends on the loop variable i and the parameter size, so it is not invariant. There are no do-while or while loops with constant conditions, nor any other constant controlling expressions.\n\n- Other expressions (ternary ?:, assignments, bitwise ops) are not loop/selection controlling expressions and thus are not relevant to Rule 14.3.\n\nTherefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 14.3 compliance in the supplied code."
