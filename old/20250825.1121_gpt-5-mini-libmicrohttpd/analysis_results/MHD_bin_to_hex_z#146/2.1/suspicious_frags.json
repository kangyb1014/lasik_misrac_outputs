  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I found no unreachable code fragments in the provided code. Reasoning:\n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex_z: The call to MHD_bin_to_hex and the subsequent assignment hex[res] = 0 are both reachable for all input sizes (including size == 0, where MHD_bin_to_hex returns 0 and hex[0] = 0 is executed). The final return statement is of course reachable. There is no code after return or any dead branches.\n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex: The for loop body is executed when i < size and skipped when size == 0; skipping the loop is valid and does not create unreachable statements. The ternary expressions for selecting hex digits have both outcomes reachable depending on the byte value j. The return i * 2 is reachable in all cases (including i == 0).\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex: The early returns (when the buffer is too small or when MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash returns MHD_NO) are conditional and reachable; the final call to MHD_bin_to_hex_z and the return MHD_YES are reachable when the preconditions are met. There is no code that can never be reached.\n\nNo other hidden compile-time constants or macros were provided that would render branches unreachable. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
