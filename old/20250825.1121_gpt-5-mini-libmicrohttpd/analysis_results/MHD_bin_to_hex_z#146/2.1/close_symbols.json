  "explanation": "- MHD_bin_to_hex: The target function immediately calls this routine; to decide whether the statement hex[res] = 0 (and the subsequent return) is reachable we must inspect MHD_bin_to_hex's implementation and behavior (does it always return, can it loop forever, call exit/abort/longjmp, or otherwise be non\u2011returning).\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex: The static call graph shows this as the caller of MHD_bin_to_hex_z. To determine whether the entire function MHD_bin_to_hex_z is unreachable in the project (a violation of the MISRA rule at file/program level) we must know whether its callers are themselves reachable from program entry points.\n- Any non\u2011returning functions called (directly or indirectly) by MHD_bin_to_hex, e.g. exit/abort/longjmp if present: If MHD_bin_to_hex invokes a non\u2011returning function (or a chain of calls that ends in one), the code after the call in MHD_bin_to_hex_z would be statically unreachable. The actual symbols used by MHD_bin_to_hex are needed to prove or refute that.\n- Program entry points or callers of MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex (e.g. main or public API entry functions / registration points): To conclude that MHD_bin_to_hex_z is unreachable project\u2011wide (not just within the function), we need to trace from program entry points to see if MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex (and thus MHD_bin_to_hex_z) is ever invoked.\n- Declaration/attributes of MHD_bin_to_hex (any 'noreturn' or compiler attributes): Attributes or annotations on the declaration can statically indicate non\u2011returning behavior (making subsequent statements unreachable) without inspecting the full body; include these to allow a sound determination."
