  "explanation": "- MHD_bin_to_hex: The target function calls this routine and then writes hex[res] = 0. To check for out-of-bounds access you must know exactly how many bytes MHD_bin_to_hex writes into the hex buffer (number of hex characters), what it returns (value meaning: number of bytes written, does it include a terminating NUL?), and any preconditions (e.g. that hex points to a buffer of at least some minimum size). Its prototype/implementation or documentation is required.  \n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex: This function is a documented caller of MHD_bin_to_hex_z. To ensure hex[res] = 0 is safe you must inspect how this caller allocates or supplies the hex buffer and what size argument it passes to MHD_bin_to_hex_z. The caller\u2019s code reveals the buffer length and whether there is room for the extra terminating byte.  \n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash: The caller likely obtains the binary data and/or its length from this function. You need its behaviour to know the length and validity of the 'bin' data passed into MHD_bin_to_hex_z (so you can verify the size parameter matches the actual binary object length and that no over-read/writes occur).  \n\n- digest_get_hash_size: The caller calls this to determine hash length; you need this to compute expected binary length and the corresponding required hex buffer size (usually a function of hash byte length).  \n\n- any buffer-size macros/definitions used by MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex: If the caller uses constants or macros to size the hex buffer (for example a macro that defines the hex buffer length as 2*HASH_SIZE + 1), those definitions are required to confirm that the buffer is large enough to hold the output of MHD_bin_to_hex plus the terminating NUL written by MHD_bin_to_hex_z.  \n\nCollecting the implementation/prototypes and buffer-size expressions for these symbols lets you determine (a) how many bytes are written by MHD_bin_to_hex, (b) what res denotes, and (c) whether the caller-supplied hex buffer has at least res+1 bytes so that hex[res] = 0 cannot access out of bounds (the MISRA <string.h> related bound-safety concern)."
