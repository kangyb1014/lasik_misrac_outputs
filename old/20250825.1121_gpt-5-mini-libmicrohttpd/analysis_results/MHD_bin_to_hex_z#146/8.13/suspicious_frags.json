  "suspicious_frags": [
    "MHD_bin_to_hex_z (const void *bin,\n                  size_t size,\n                  char *hex)",

  ],
  "explanation": "The only potential Rule 8.13 concern is the use of pointer parameters and how they are propagated to other functions. The parameter 'bin' is already const-qualified in this function signature, so its declaration itself complies. The parameter 'hex' is intentionally non-const because the function modifies the buffer (see hex[res] = 0), so it should not be qualified const. The remaining code does not introduce additional pointers that could or should be const-qualified. The key item to investigate is the call to MHD_bin_to_hex(bin, size, hex): verify the prototype of MHD_bin_to_hex to ensure it accepts a const-qualified pointer for the binary input; if its first parameter is not const-qualified, the call discards const and would violate Rule 8.13. The other fragments are included to show where the modification occurs and the parameter declarations so investigators can make the necessary prototype/usage checks."
