  "explanation": "MHD_bin_to_hex_z simply forwards its 'bin' and 'hex' arguments to MHD_bin_to_hex and then writes to hex[res]. To decide if MHD_bin_to_hex_z violates the MISRA rule about using const-qualified pointer types we must know how the callee declares and uses those pointers: \n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex (prototype / declaration): Needed to see the exact parameter types and const-qualifiers in the function signature. If the callee's prototype expects a non-const void * for 'bin', then passing a const void * from MHD_bin_to_hex_z would discard const-qualification (potential MISRA violation). If the callee already declares 'bin' as const void *, then MHD_bin_to_hex_z's const qualification is consistent. The prototype also shows whether 'hex' is declared as writable (char *) or const (const char *).\n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex (definition / implementation): Needed to determine whether the function actually modifies the memory pointed to by 'bin' or 'hex'. If the implementation does not modify 'bin' then the callee (and possibly callers) should have used const, and the prototype/usage would be a const-qualification omission. If the implementation modifies 'bin', then 'bin' cannot be const. Likewise, confirming whether the callee writes into the 'hex' buffer ensures that 'hex' must be non-const (and MHD_bin_to_hex_z's write to hex[res] is legitimate).\n\nNo other symbols are required to decide const-qualification correctness for the parameters used in MHD_bin_to_hex_z."
