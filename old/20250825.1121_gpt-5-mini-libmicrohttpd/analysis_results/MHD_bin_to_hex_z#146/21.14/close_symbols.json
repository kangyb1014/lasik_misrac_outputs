  "explanation": "- MHD_bin_to_hex: The target function directly calls this routine. To determine whether memcmp is being used to compare a null\u2011terminated string produced by MHD_bin_to_hex_z you must inspect MHD_bin_to_hex for any internal uses of memcmp or for details on the length it returns (res) and how it writes the hex bytes.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns uses of the standard memcmp function. You must locate all uses of memcmp (prototype/uses) in the implementations above to see whether any call compares buffers that are in fact null\u2011terminated C strings (instead of raw byte buffers).\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex: This function is a caller of MHD_bin_to_hex_z (from the static call graph). It may immediately compare the produced hex string (or pass it to code that does), so its implementation must be checked for memcmp usage on the null\u2011terminated hex output.\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash: Called by MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex; its implementation may perform comparisons on hash/hex data or call other helpers that use memcmp. Inspecting it ensures no indirect memcmp-on-string violations.\n- calculate_nonce: This function calls MHD_bin_to_hex (per the call graph). Its implementation must be checked in case it compares the hex output with memcmp treating it as a null\u2011terminated string.\n- digest_auth_check_all_inner: Also calls MHD_bin_to_hex (per the call graph). Inspect it for memcmp usage that might compare the hex output as a null\u2011terminated string.\n\nTogether these symbols cover the direct callee of the target, the standard function governed by the rule, and the immediate callers/call-chains that could compare the hex result with memcmp. Inspecting these implementations will show whether memcmp is ever used to compare a null\u2011terminated string produced or handled by MHD_bin_to_hex_z."
