  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 were found. The function does not modify any parameter variables themselves: 'bin' is a const void * (not modified), 'size' is not assigned to, and 'hex' is not reassigned. The only write is hex[res] = 0, which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter (the buffer contents) \u2014 this is explicitly permitted by the rule. The call to MHD_bin_to_hex passes the parameters but does not involve reassigning any parameter in this function. Therefore there are no parameter modifications that would violate Rule 17.8."
