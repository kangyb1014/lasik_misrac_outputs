  "explanation": "1) struct Md5Ctx (complete definition) - The rule is about modifying a function parameter vs. the object pointed to. You must see the full struct Md5Ctx to confirm that H and count are ordinary members (their types, whether they are arrays, pointers, bit-fields, or macro-injected constructs). If H or count are defined unusually (e.g. as macros or as aliases to something that would modify the pointer itself), that could change whether the function modifies the pointer variable or only the pointee.\n\n2) UINT32_C (macro definition) - The code uses UINT32_C(...) for the assigned constants. You need the macro expansion to verify it is an innocuous integer-constant macro (no side effects, no expressions that could expand to code that reassigns ctx). If UINT32_C were a function-like macro with side effects it might affect parameter semantics.\n\n3) uint32_t and related stdint typedefs / headers - These are needed because UINT32_C is normally defined in the stdint/inttypes headers; having those definitions lets the analyzer determine the macro expansion and types involved to ensure the assignments are simple constant initialisations and not something that could modify the pointer parameter.\n\n4) Any preprocessor macros named H, count, ctx - Member names and the parameter identifier are tokens subject to preprocessor replacement. A macro named H or count (or even ctx) could rewrite the expressions ctx->H[...] or ctx->count into something that modifies the pointer variable rather than the pointee. The analyzer must know whether such macros exist in scope to conclude the function does or does not modify the parameter itself."
