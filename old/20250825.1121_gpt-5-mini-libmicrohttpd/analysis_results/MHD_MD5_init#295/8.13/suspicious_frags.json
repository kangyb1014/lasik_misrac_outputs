  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usage found relative to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameter is \"struct Md5Ctx *ctx\" and the function clearly modifies the object pointed to (assigns to ctx->H[0..3] and ctx->count), so it must be a pointer to non-const and does not violate the rule. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-to-data usages in the function that could be made const-qualified. Therefore no fragments in this function need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
