  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n1) struct Md5Ctx (full definition)\n   - Required to see the types and qualifiers of the members (H and count). The MISRA rule concerns pointer-to-type const-qualification; to decide whether MHD_MD5_init could/should accept a pointer-to-const you must know whether the function modifies the pointed object (it writes ctx->H[] and ctx->count). The struct definition shows whether those members are mutable, their types, and whether any nested const/volatile qualifiers exist that affect whether a const-qualified pointer would be possible.\n\n2) declaration/prototype of MHD_MD5_init (header prototype, if any)\n   - The prototype in a header may include different qualifiers than the implementation. To check for a MISRA violation you must confirm the externally visible declaration matches the definition and whether it uses const-qualified pointer types (or if there's an inconsistency).\n\n3) definitions or source lines of callers: digest_init_one_time (including the call site(s) that invoke MHD_MD5_init)\n   - You need to inspect how MHD_MD5_init is called: what object/address is passed (an automatic Md5Ctx, address of a static, or a pointer derived from a const object). If callers pass the address of a const-qualified object or perform casts, that indicates potential non-conformance. Also helps determine whether the pointer parameter could realistically be const-qualified.\n\n4) definitions or source lines of callers: digest_reset (including the call site(s) that invoke MHD_MD5_init)\n   - Same reason as (3): check the actual call sites to see what is passed and whether callers expect MHD_MD5_init to modify the object or are passing const objects, which affects whether the parameter should be const-qualified.\n\n5) UINT32_C macro definition\n   - Shows the exact type of the constants written into ctx->H[]. While not directly about pointer const-qualification, it documents the element type of H[] (e.g., uint32_t), which you need when examining struct Md5Ctx and deciding if any const narrowing/qualification issues exist.\n\n6) typedef of uint32_t (or underlying integer typedef used for H[])\n   - Required to confirm the precise type used for H[] members. Knowing the exact type is useful to reason about whether assignments in MHD_MD5_init are modifying fields of a non-const object and to ensure there are no hidden const qualifiers or typedefs that would change the const-correctness analysis.\n\nIn short: start with the complete struct Md5Ctx and the callers' call sites (and the public prototype) to decide if the function actually modifies the pointed object or is forced by callers to accept a non-const pointer; include the integer typedef and UINT32_C macro to fully understand the member types involved."
