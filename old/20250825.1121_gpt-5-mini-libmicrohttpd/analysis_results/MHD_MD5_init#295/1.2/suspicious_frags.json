  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The code uses standard C types and macros (uint32_t, uint64_t, UINT32_C) which are part of the C standard (stdint.h/C99) rather than compiler extensions. The function declaration and struct usage are standard C. There are no GCC/Clang-specific keywords or attributes (for example __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, typeof, __builtin_*, __declspec, etc.), no inline assembly, no designated initializers that rely on extensions, and no other documented compiler extensions are present in the shown fragments. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in the supplied code."
