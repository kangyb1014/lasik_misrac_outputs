  "explanation": "- struct Md5Ctx: required to see the full definition of the context structure so we can determine whether any member access in MHD_MD5_init involves qualifiers (e.g. volatile) or embedded control semantics. If the struct or its members are declared with qualifiers or unusual types this could affect whether any expressions are invariant or have side effects.\n- Md5Ctx::H: the declaration and type of the H member (e.g. uint32_t H[4]) are needed to confirm that the assignments are simple integer constant initialisations and not calls/macros or volatile writes that could hide control-flow or invariant issues.\n- Md5Ctx::count: the declaration and type of count are needed to verify that the assignment ctx->count = 0 is a plain assignment to an integer object (and not, for example, a macro, function-like accessor, or volatile/registered object) which could introduce control or invariant behaviour.\n- UINT32_C: the macro definition must be inspected to ensure it expands to a simple integer constant expression and does not contain any control constructs (for example, do/while or conditional expressions) that could introduce invariant controlling expressions in the function body.\n- uint32_t (stdint.h): the underlying fixed-width integer type and any related typedefs or platform-specific macros are required to check that the constants and UINT32_C produce compile-time integer constants and to ensure no hidden control-flow or platform-specific semantics affect invariance.\n\nThese symbols together are sufficient to determine whether any expressions in MHD_MD5_init act as controlling expressions that are invariant (or secretly expand to control constructs). The callers in the provided call graph are not necessary for checking MISRA Rule on controlling expressions within this function itself."
