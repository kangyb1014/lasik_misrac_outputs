  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide if MHD_MD5_init contains dead code:\n\n- struct Md5Ctx\n  - Needed to know the exact layout and types of ctx->H and ctx->count, and whether these assignments are initializations (at object definition) or plain assignments to an existing object (affects whether they can be considered dead per MISRA note 3).\n\n- digest_init_one_time\n  - Direct caller of MHD_MD5_init; we must see how this caller uses the MD5 context (whether the initialized values are later read or overwritten) to determine if MHD_MD5_init effects matter.\n\n- digest_reset\n  - Direct caller of MHD_MD5_init; same rationale as above (reset semantics often imply the initialization must have effect, but code analysis must confirm usage).\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest\n  - Transitive caller (calls digest_init_one_time). Examining it shows whether an MD5 context initialized by MHD_MD5_init is actually used to produce outputs that affect program behaviour (so the init is not dead).\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash\n  - Another transitive caller; same reason \u2014 to see if initialized MD5 state is consumed.\n\n- digest_auth_check_all_inner\n  - Transitive caller of both digest_init_one_time and digest_reset; required to determine runtime paths and whether MD5 initialization is used along those paths.\n\n- queue_auth_required_response3_inner\n  - Transitive caller of digest_init_one_time; needed to see end-to-end usage of the MD5 context produced by init.\n\n- calculate_add_nonce_with_retry\n  - Caller of digest_reset; needed to analyze whether reset (and thus the MD5 init inside it) affects program behaviour in that flow.\n\n- functions that consume/operate on Md5Ctx state (e.g. MHD_MD5_update, MHD_MD5_final or any MD5 transform/finalize functions)\n  - To decide if initializing H[] and count is meaningful we must find consumers that read ctx->H or ctx->count (or depend on their values). If no consumer reads them before they are overwritten or the context is discarded, the assignments in MHD_MD5_init could be dead.\n\n- allocation/creation sites of Md5Ctx instances (where ctx is allocated or stored)\n  - To determine object lifetime and whether MHD_MD5_init is restoring initial state on an already-initialized object or initializing a fresh object (initialization vs assignment distinction). Also to find all call sites and usages of the same context object.\n\n- UINT32_C macro/definition\n  - Minor: to confirm these are simple compile-time constants with no side effects; ensures the assignments are pure value writes and not invoking hidden behaviour.\n\nIn summary: to decide whether the assignments inside MHD_MD5_init are dead code we must trace all call paths that lead to this init, find every consumer of the Md5Ctx state (reads of H[] or count) and the object allocation/lifetime semantics (to decide initialization vs assignment). The listed symbols provide the necessary call-site, consumer, and type information for that analysis."
