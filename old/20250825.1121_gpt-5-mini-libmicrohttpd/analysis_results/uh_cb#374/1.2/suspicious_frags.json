  "explanation": "I found no explicit compiler language extensions in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C (function definitions, variadic function '...', casts, pointer usage) or POSIX/platform APIs (pthread_*, recv/send, ssize_t, shutdown) \u2014 these are platform libraries, not compiler-language extensions as required by Rule 1.2. There are no GCC/MSVC-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __declspec, typeof, asm(), statement-expressions ({ ...; }), nested functions, or other compiler-specific keywords/constructs in the shown source. The only macro-like token shown (_MHD_EXTERN) is not expanded here; its use alone is not proof of a compiler language extension \u2014 if that macro expands to a compiler-specific extension (for example __declspec or an attribute), the macro definition would need to be inspected to confirm and should be investigated. Based on the visible code, no fragments match the criterion for language-compiler extensions, so nothing is reported."
