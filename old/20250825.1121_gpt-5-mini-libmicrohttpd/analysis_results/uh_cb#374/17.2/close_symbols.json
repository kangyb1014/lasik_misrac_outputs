  "explanation": "To determine whether uh_cb can call itself (directly or indirectly) you must inspect the functions on the potential call path(s) that uh_cb creates or invokes:\n\n- run_usock: uh_cb creates a detached thread that starts at run_usock (pthread_create(..., &run_usock, ...)). If run_usock calls MHD_upgrade_action or otherwise ends up invoking uh_cb, that establishes an indirect recursion chain started by uh_cb. Inspect run_usock to see its callees and whether any path reaches uh_cb.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: uh_cb calls this function directly (shown in the static graph). If MHD_upgrade_action (or anything it triggers) eventually calls uh_cb, that is an indirect recursive call. You must examine MHD_upgrade_action\u2019s implementation and its call graph.\n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: This function is listed as a callee of MHD_upgrade_action in the provided static graph. It (and any functions it calls) must be checked for any path back to uh_cb. If none of these reachable functions lead to uh_cb, the indirect recursion path via MHD_upgrade_action is broken.\n\n(Other runtime helpers such as pthread_create/pthread_detach only establish the thread context; they do not by themselves create call paths back to uh_cb and therefore are not required to resolve the recursion question.)"
