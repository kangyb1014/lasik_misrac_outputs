  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for checking the MISRA rule (\"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\"): \n\n- struct MyData: The code allocates and populates an instance of struct MyData (md). To decide whether any pointer members (e.g. extra_in, urh, or others) could or should be declared as pointing to const-qualified types you must see the definition and current member types and whether members are ever modified. \n\n- run_usock: The newly created thread is passed md (start routine &run_usock). Whether md\u2019s members must be writable (so cannot be const) depends entirely on how run_usock accesses/modifies them. You need the run_usock definition to determine if members could be const. \n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: The static call graph indicates MHD_upgrade_action is invoked in the upgrade/socket handling path (called from run_usock / or related code). If run_usock or other code calls MHD_upgrade_action with pointers taken from md, the prototype/behavior of MHD_upgrade_action will show whether those pointers are treated as read-only or are modified; that affects whether they can be const. \n\n- pthread_create (prototype): pthread_create requires a start routine of type void *(*)(void *). This signature constrains whether you can change run_usock\u2019s parameter to a const-qualified pointer type (the pthread API requires void*). You need the prototype to understand this external constraint when deciding if const qualification is feasible for the thread-entry parameter. \n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: uh_cb stores the urh pointer into md->urh. To know whether urh could be a pointer to const (i.e. struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle const *), you must inspect the type definition and how urh is used later (notably in run_usock / MHD_upgrade_action). \n\n- MHD_socket (typedef): sock is stored in md->sock. Knowing whether MHD_socket is an integer type or a pointer affects whether const-qualification is even relevant for that field. \n\n- struct MHD_Connection: Although connection is unused in uh_cb, its declared type in the library/headers and how callers treat it may affect whether its pointer parameter in callbacks could be const; include the definition to check any cross-file expectations about constness.\n\nIn short: the key information is the struct MyData layout and all functions that access its members (run_usock and the functions it calls such as MHD_upgrade_action), plus the pthread_create prototype which constrains the thread-start function signature, and the types for MHD-related objects to determine whether their pointers can reasonably be const."
