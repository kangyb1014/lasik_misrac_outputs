  "explanation": "I have listed all code fragments that may involve pointers which could reasonably be const-qualified (or where the const-qualification of the pointee should be checked): the struct member that holds the copied buffer (char *extra_in), the allocation/copy/use/free of that buffer, the places where that buffer is passed to send routines, the conversion/usage of the void* thread argument as a struct MyData*, the public API function taking a non-const upgrade-handle pointer, and the callback signature with several non-const pointer parameters. These are the locations where const qualification is most likely to be applicable (e.g. buffers passed only for reading, pointers stored but not modified) and thus warrant inspection.\n\nI did not include other fragments because they either already use const where appropriate (extra_in parameter to uh_cb is already const), are standard API signatures that require non-const void* (pthread start routine argument) or are clearly modifying the pointed-to objects (e.g. MHD_upgrade_action and MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ manipulate the upgrade handle/connection state, recv writes into buf so buf cannot be const, allocations and frees necessarily need mutable pointers). Lines that merely assign primitive fields (md->sock, md->extra_in_size, md->urh) or perform memory management (malloc, memset) without pointer semantic concerns were not flagged because they do not indicate a missing const qualification of pointer types."
