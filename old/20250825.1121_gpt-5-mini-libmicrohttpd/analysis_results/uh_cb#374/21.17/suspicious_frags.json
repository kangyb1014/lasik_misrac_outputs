  "explanation": "Only the calls to functions from <string.h> are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The code contains two uses of such functions (memset and memcpy) which are included above and should be investigated for potential out-of-bounds accesses. Other parts of the function do not call string.h routines (e.g. the pthread calls, assignments to struct members, the (void) casts to silence warnings, abort handling) and therefore are not relevant to this rule and do not need investigation for Rule 21.17. No other string.h functions (strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, memmove, memcmp, memset beyond the one listed) appear in the provided code."
