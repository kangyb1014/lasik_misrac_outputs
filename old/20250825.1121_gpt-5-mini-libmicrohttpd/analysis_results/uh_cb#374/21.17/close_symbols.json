This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- struct MyData (definition): needed to know the exact type of md->extra_in and md->extra_in_size (pointer type, intended ownership, and sizes). This verifies that the destination passed to memcpy has the size and layout you expect and whether future users may assume non-NULL for zero-length buffers.\n\n- run_usock (thread-start function definition): the newly created thread receives md and may read or write md->extra_in using md->extra_in_size. To determine whether any later use could access beyond the allocated bounds (or assume md->extra_in non-NULL when it may be NULL), the body of run_usock must be inspected.\n\n- The MHD code that invokes uh_cb / the upgrade-callback registration site and its callback prototype/documentation: uh_cb receives extra_in and extra_in_size from the HTTP library. You must know the caller\u2019s contract: whether extra_in may be NULL when extra_in_size>0, whether extra_in_size is the exact number of valid bytes at extra_in, and lifetime/ownership guarantees of extra_in. This is essential to prove memcpy(src, size) is safe.\n\n- Provenance of extra_in (the module/function that owns the buffer passed as extra_in): if different from the invoker above, inspect the producer of the buffer to ensure it actually provides at least extra_in_size bytes. memcpy safety requires the source buffer to be at least extra_in_size bytes long.\n\n- Declarations/prototypes of memcpy, memset, malloc (standard library): while these are standard, having the prototypes in scope confirms parameter types and behavior (e.g., memcpy copies exactly the requested size). This supports a precise formal analysis of whether the call can read or write out-of-bounds.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst confirm (a) the destination md->extra_in is allocated with at least extra_in_size bytes, (b) extra_in points to at least extra_in_size readable bytes when extra_in_size>0, and (c) subsequent uses (e.g., in run_usock) do not access beyond those bounds, which are the conditions required by the MISRA string-handling bounds rule."
