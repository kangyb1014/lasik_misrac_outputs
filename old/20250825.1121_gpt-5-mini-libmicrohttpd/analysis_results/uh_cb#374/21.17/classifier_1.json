  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The code allocates md with malloc(sizeof(struct MyData)) and immediately calls memset(md, 0, sizeof(struct MyData)), so the number of bytes written equals the number of bytes allocated. This does not access beyond the bounds of the object, so Rule 21.17 is not violated. (A violating scenario would be, for example, calling memset(md, 0, sizeof(struct MyData) + N) where N > 0 or using a smaller allocation than the size passed to memset.)"
