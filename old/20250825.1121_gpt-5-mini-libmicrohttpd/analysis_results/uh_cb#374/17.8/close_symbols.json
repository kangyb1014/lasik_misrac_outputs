  "explanation": "Short rationale for each symbol (why needed to decide if uh_cb modifies any of its parameters):\n\n- struct MyData: uh_cb writes into fields md->extra_in, md->extra_in_size, md->sock and md->urh. The definition is needed to confirm those are independent storage locations (so copying parameter values into them does not constitute modifying the parameter itself) and to ensure no aliasing with any parameter.\n\n- run_usock: spawned as the new thread start. Its prototype/definition is required to verify that uh_cb does not pass the address of any of its own parameters to the thread (which would allow the thread to modify uh_cb's parameter objects) and to ensure run_usock cannot alias or otherwise mutate uh_cb parameters.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef/definition): sock is of this type. Knowing whether MHD_socket is an integral type, a pointer type, or a macro/alias is necessary to decide whether assignment md->sock = sock or use of sock could be a modification of a parameter (e.g., if MHD_socket were a complicated macro or lvalue alias).\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: uh_cb stores urh into md->urh. Its definition/type is needed to ensure this is a simple copy of the parameter value and not an operation that could mutate the parameter object via indirection or hidden side-effects.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: although connection is unused, its definition is useful to rule out any unusual macro/type behavior that could cause uses like (void) connection to expand to something that modifies the parameter.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: the static call graph lists this as a callee. Its declaration/definition is required to check whether uh_cb actually calls it (possibly via macro) or whether that callee could indirectly cause modification of uh_cb's parameters (e.g., if some macro expansion uses parameter names).\n\n- pthread_create and pthread_detach: their prototypes/macros are needed to ensure the way pthread_create is invoked does not pass addresses of uh_cb parameters (it passes md and &pt) and that these wrappers do not perform any hidden modifications of uh_cb parameters.\n\n- malloc, memset, memcpy, abort: these standard library functions are used on values derived from the parameters (extra_in, extra_in_size). Their prototypes/standard semantics are needed to ensure none of them modify the incoming parameter variables (they operate on provided pointers/values, but do not modify the parameter variable itself)."
