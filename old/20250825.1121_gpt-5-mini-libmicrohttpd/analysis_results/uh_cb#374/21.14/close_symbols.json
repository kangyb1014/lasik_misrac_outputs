  "explanation": "run_usock: uh_cb spawns a worker thread with run_usock as the thread start routine. Any use of memcmp on data produced by uh_cb could occur inside run_usock, so its body (and transitive callees) must be inspected. \n\nstruct MyData: uh_cb allocates and populates an instance of struct MyData and passes it to the worker thread; the definition is required to know the types and semantics of fields (especially extra_in and extra_in_size) to determine whether any byte buffer passed to memcmp is a null-terminated string.\n\nMyData::extra_in: the buffer copied from extra_in in uh_cb \u2014 you must know whether this buffer is treated as a C string elsewhere (terminated or not) before any memcmp is applied.\n\nMyData::extra_in_size: the size recorded for extra_in. Whether extra_in_size includes or guarantees a terminating NUL (or not) is central to deciding if memcmp is being (improperly) used on null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nMHD_upgrade_action: static call graph shows uh_cb calls this function; it (or its callees) might use memcmp on data supplied by uh_cb, so its implementation must be inspected for memcmp usage comparing strings.\n\nMHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: listed as a callee of MHD_upgrade_action; included because memcmp use could be deeper in the call chain and must be examined.\n\nmemcmp: the specific Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule; presence and use-sites must be found in run_usock, MHD_upgrade_action, or their transitive callees to determine a violation.\n\nstrcmp, strncmp: alternative C string comparison functions \u2014 include for completeness because analysis should check for use of any string-comparison functions (to understand whether comparisons are done via memcmp on buffers that are actually null-terminated strings, or via the intended string APIs)."
