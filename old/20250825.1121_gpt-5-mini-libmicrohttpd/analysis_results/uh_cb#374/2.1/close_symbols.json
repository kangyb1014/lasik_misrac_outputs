  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in uh_cb is unreachable you must know which calls or definitions can alter control flow or make paths terminate unconditionally, and what external callees may do.\n\n- abort: must know that abort is a non\u2011returning function (noreturn). If abort never returns, any statements following a taken abort path are unreachable along that path; the analyzer needs the noreturn property.\n- malloc: its return value is tested for NULL and leads to abort; the analyzer must know malloc can return NULL so the abort path is conditional (not always taken).\n- memset: does not change control flow but its prototype/behavior confirms it does not longjmp or abort; needed to rule out hidden control transfers.\n- memcpy: same rationale as memset (ensure no hidden termination or longjmp behaviour).\n- pthread_create: return value is tested and may cause abort; the analyzer needs its return semantics (0 on success, non\u2011zero on failure) to determine whether subsequent code (pthread_detach and function return) is reachable.\n- pthread_detach: prototype/behavior (does it return or longjmp?) to ensure it does not affect reachability of later statements.\n- run_usock: thread entry passed to pthread_create; if run_usock has attributes (noreturn) or side effects that influence whether code after pthread_create is relevant, the analyzer should see its signature and attributes. Also static call graph shows run_usock calls MHD_upgrade_action \u2014 relevant for whole-program reachability reasoning.\n- struct MyData: layout/size affects malloc sizes and whether sizeof yields zero (very unlikely but analyzer should know there is no sizeof 0) and confirms use of md->extra_in and md->urh fields.\n- MHD_socket and struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: parameter types stored into md; their definitions may include attributes or macros that influence control flow (unlikely but included for completeness when reasoning about stored pointers and possible aliasing).\n- MHD_upgrade_action and MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: they appear in the static call graph (uh_cb -> MHD_upgrade_action path via run_usock) \u2014 the analyzer needs their prototypes/attributes to reason about cross\u2011function control flow and to ensure no hidden non\u2011returning behaviour or unconditional calls that would render parts of uh_cb unreachable.\n\nProviding the above symbols (prototypes and attributes) lets the next agent decide whether any statements in uh_cb are impossible to reach under any feasible execution (MISRA unreachable\u2011code rule)."
