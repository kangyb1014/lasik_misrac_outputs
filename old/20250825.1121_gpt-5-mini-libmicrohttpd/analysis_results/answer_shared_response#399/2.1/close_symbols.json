  "explanation": "For a sound determination of whether any code in answer_shared_response is unreachable you must know the definitions and runtime/contractual properties of several external symbols and APIs referenced by the function:\n\n- num_resps\n  - Reason: resp_index is computed as (last_index++) % num_resps. If num_resps can be 0 (or has a static constant value), this is undefined behaviour or makes the path that uses resp_index infeasible; conversely if num_resps is a compile-time constant >0 it proves the modulo path is executable. You must know its value/range to decide reachability of the final return path.\n\n- resps\n  - Reason: The array (or pointer) passed to MHD_queue_response determines whether the final branch can be executed successfully (indexing validity) and whether the response-selection path is meaningful. Its length/type information is needed to determine whether accessing resps[resp_index] is defined for any possible resp_index.\n\n- MHD_queue_response (definition/semantics)\n  - Reason: To decide reachability you must know whether this callee actually returns normally, can longjmp, abort, or otherwise not return (which would affect whether code after it could be reachable). Also its signature/behaviour determines whether passing resps[resp_index] can cause immediate termination/error that would make following code unreachable (or signal an error path).\n\n- strcmp (declaration/behaviour)\n  - Reason: The branch that returns MHD_NO depends on strcmp semantics (returning 0 on equality). Confirming that the condition can evaluate both true and false requires knowing strcmp behaviour (and whether method/strings passed are well-formed), to see if either branch is feasible.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET and MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD\n  - Reason: These constants/strings are used in the method comparison. If they are defined in an unexpected way (for example aliased to the same value, or to something impossible), that could make one branch impossible and thus render other code unreachable.\n\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO, MHD_HTTP_OK\n  - Reason: These return-value constants identify the early returns. Knowing that these macros/enumerators are normal return values (and do not have exotic side effects) is necessary to reason that the return statements actually terminate the function and do not encode unreachable-following-code scenarios.\n\n- libmicrohttpd handler contract / MHD_start_daemon (con_cls initialization and calling convention)\n  - Reason: The first if ((NULL == *req_cls)) is predicated on the external library's callback invocation semantics: many HTTP server libraries (including libmicrohttpd) guarantee *con_cls is NULL on the first invocation for a request and preserved for subsequent invocations. To conclude whether the code after this if can ever be executed you must know whether the framework can/does call this handler multiple times per connection/request and whether it initializes *req_cls to NULL on the first call. This is the central piece for deciding if the \"first-call\" return makes the remainder unreachable forever or only for that first invocation.\n\n- semantics/validity of the 'method' parameter (nullable/always non-NULL)\n  - Reason: The feasibility of the method-comparison branch depends on whether the 'method' pointer passed by the framework can be NULL or has constrained values. If 'method' can never be anything other than GET/HEAD in the deployed setup, then the branch returning MHD_NO would be unreachable; conversely if NULL is possible, strcmp calls may be undefined. Knowing the formal API contract for the parameter is required to determine reachability and defined behaviour.\n\nProviding these symbols/definitions (their value ranges, types, and the server-callback contract) will allow a precise analysis of whether any branch or statement in answer_shared_response is statically/semantically unreachable under all permitted execution scenarios."
