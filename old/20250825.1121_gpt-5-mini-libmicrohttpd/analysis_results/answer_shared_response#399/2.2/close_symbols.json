  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for dead-code (MISRA) analysis of answer_shared_response:\n\n- num_resps\n  Needed because resp_index is computed as (last_index++) % num_resps. If num_resps == 0 this is undefined/UB; if num_resps == 1 the selection is constant. The value and type of num_resps determine whether the resp selection (and therefore the MHD_queue_response call) can have any effect \u2014 i.e. whether the code that computes/selects a response is meaningful or effectively dead.\n\n- resps\n  The array (or collection) of response objects passed to MHD_queue_response. To decide if the call to MHD_queue_response changes behaviour, we must know whether resps[resp_index] is a valid, non-trivial response (and whether different indices matter). If resps entries are all identical or null/no-op responses, the call could be dead.\n\n- MHD_queue_response\n  The function invoked at the end of answer_shared_response. Determining whether that call is dead requires the implementation/contract of MHD_queue_response (its side effects on connection state, global state, scheduling, return value semantics). If MHD_queue_response has no observable effect for given inputs, the call (and preceding indexing) might be dead.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO, MHD_HTTP_OK)\n  The return codes control connection handling in the framework. Understanding the semantics of MHD_YES vs MHD_NO (and MHD_HTTP_OK passed to MHD_queue_response) is necessary to decide whether returning early or calling MHD_queue_response changes overall program behaviour (e.g. closing connection vs queuing response), so these symbols and their semantics must be known.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET and MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD\n  The code uses strcmp against these constants to filter supported methods. Knowing their exact values (and whether they can be NULL or alias each other) is required to see if the method-check branch is ever effective or redundant (dead).\n\n- strcmp\n  Standard string-compare semantics are assumed, but to be rigorous one must know that strcmp returns 0 for equality and non-zero otherwise; this is fundamental to determine whether the conditional that returns MHD_NO can ever be taken for real inputs.\n\n- req_cls callback lifecycle / libmicrohttpd request-callback protocol\n  The function relies on the caller preserving *req_cls across multiple invocations (first call: *req_cls is NULL => set to &marker and return MHD_YES without replying). Whether that assignment and early return are required (i.e. observable) depends on the library's lifecycle rules. The documented callback protocol (when callbacks are invoked, how *req_cls is initialised/used, and how returning MHD_YES without a response affects later invocations) is essential to decide if the first-call branch is meaningful or dead.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition/semantics)\n  The connection object is passed to MHD_queue_response. Its semantics (whether it can be NULL here, how MHD_queue_response mutates it, etc.) are needed to judge whether calling MHD_queue_response is observable. In addition, knowledge of whether the connection is reused across calls impacts whether setting *req_cls matters.\n\nNotes: The goal is to determine whether any executed operations in answer_shared_response could be removed without changing program behaviour. That requires knowing the runtime values and semantics of the external symbols listed above (global arrays/counts, callback protocol and MHD_queue_response side effects, constants used in conditionals)."
