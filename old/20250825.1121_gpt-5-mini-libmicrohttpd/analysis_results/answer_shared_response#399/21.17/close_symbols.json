  "explanation": "Reason each symbol is needed to check MISRA string-bounds for the strcmp use in answer_shared_response:\n\n- strcmp (from <string.h>): The MISRA rule applies to use of standard string functions. You must inspect the exact strcmp prototype/semantics (null-termination requirement, pointer validity preconditions) so the analyzer can decide whether this call can read past object bounds.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET and MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD: These are the right-hand operands passed to strcmp. You need their definitions to confirm they are proper null-terminated C strings (string literals or equivalent) and thus safe for strcmp.\n\n- The callback prototype / typedef that declares the 'method' parameter: The analysis must know the declared type and documented contract for the parameter (const char *method). The prototype / header may carry guarantees (e.g. non-NULL, NUL-terminated) required by callers of strcmp.\n\n- The code/site that invokes this callback (the caller that passes the actual 'method' pointer): To conclude safety you must inspect the call site to see what pointer is passed in practice (could be NULL or non-terminated buffer). The invocation site or registration code often documents or enforces invariants about the pointer's validity and lifetime.\n\n- The HTTP request parsing code or MHD_Connection field that holds the method string: The concrete construction of the method string determines whether it is guaranteed to be a proper, null-terminated C string with sufficient lifetime for the callback. You must examine the parser or connection field population to ensure strcmp cannot read beyond the buffer (e.g., if method is a pointer into a non-terminated buffer or can be NULL).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer decide if the strcmp usage can legally and safely read bytes up to the terminating NUL without accessing beyond object bounds or dereferencing a NULL pointer. Without the callback/invocation and parser definitions you cannot conclude the operand 'method' is always a valid NUL-terminated string, which is required to satisfy the MISRA rule."
