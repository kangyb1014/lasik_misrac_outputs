  "explanation": "- MHD_queue_response: The only direct callee of answer_shared_response. Any use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings inside this function would make the overall operation violate the MISRA rule; inspect its body.\n- MHD_DLOG, is_reply_body_needed, MHD_increment_response_rc, MHD_connection_handle_idle, MHD_update_last_activity_: These are the callees of MHD_queue_response (per the static call graph). memcmp could be used anywhere in that call chain; each must be inspected for uses of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- resps: Global array referenced when queuing the response (resps[resp_index]). If resps elements are treated as C strings and compared via memcmp somewhere in the call chain, that would be a violation. Inspect its type and any comparisons.\n- num_resps: The size used to index resps; included to locate the definition of resps (same translation unit or module) and related code that might perform string comparisons.\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD: The code compares method against these constants. Include their definitions to confirm they are null-terminated C strings (so any memcmp used to compare them would be a forbidden use). Also check for any macro/inline that might do comparisons using memcmp.\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function in question \u2014 search for its use in the target function and in all reachable callees listed above to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- strcmp: The target uses strcmp; include its declaration/usage to confirm that the source calls strcmp rather than memcmp directly. (While strcmp is allowed, some implementations may wrap memcmp \u2014 include for completeness if policy requires examining library implementations.)\n- enum MHD_Result / MHD_YES / MHD_NO / MHD_HTTP_OK: Include these to fully understand return values and code flow, though they are not directly related to memcmp; they help identify which code paths and callees (e.g., whether MHD_queue_response is invoked) need to be inspected.\n\nInspect the listed symbols' definitions/implementations (source or headers) to find any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. Focus first on MHD_queue_response and its callees, then on resps/num_resps and the HTTP method constants."
