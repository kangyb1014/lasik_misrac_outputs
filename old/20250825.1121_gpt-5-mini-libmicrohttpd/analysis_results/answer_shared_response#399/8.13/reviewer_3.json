According to Rule 8.13 it should be 'const void *cls' whenever possible. Therefore this is a violation unless the non-const form is required by an external API (e.g. the callback prototype mandated by the MHD library), in which case the deviation is justified.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct in this context. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 encourages using pointers to const-qualified types when the pointed-to object is not modified, but it allows that the non-const form is permitted when dictated by an external API. The parameter cls is part of the libmicrohttpd callback prototype (it is declared as void *cls by the library), so the function must match that external signature. In the code cls is unused (cast to void), so the intent of Rule 8.13 is respected, and the non-const form is a required API constraint rather than a local oversight. Therefore there is no un-justified MISRA violation here. If desired, document the deviation (comment) to make the rationale explicit."
