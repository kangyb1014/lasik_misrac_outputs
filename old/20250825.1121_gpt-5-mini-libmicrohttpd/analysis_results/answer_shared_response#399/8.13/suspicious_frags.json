  "explanation": "I flagged pointer declarations and the assignment that may need const qualification. I did NOT flag the const-qualified parameters (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) because they already satisfy the rule. I did NOT flag non-pointer objects (marker, last_index, resp_index) or ordinary arithmetic/array indexing lines because Rule 8.13 concerns pointer target const-qualification. I did not mark the call to MHD_queue_response(...) or the use of connection inside it as definitely suspicious because that uses an external API which may legitimately require a non-const pointer; whether connection can be const depends on the API signature (not shown). The listed fragments are the locations in this snippet where a pointer is declared or assigned without const qualification and thus should be investigated to determine whether a const qualification would be appropriate under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
