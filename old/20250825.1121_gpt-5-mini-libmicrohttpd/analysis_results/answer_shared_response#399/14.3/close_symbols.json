  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to analyze invariance of the controlling expressions in answer_shared_response:\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET\n  - The second if compares method against this symbol. To decide if the controlling expression ((0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET)) && ...) can be invariant you must know what this symbol expands to (string literal, macro, etc.) and whether it is a compile-time constant.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD\n  - Same reason as MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET: the controlling expression checks against this symbol; its form/constness affects whether the expression can be considered invariant.\n\n- strcmp\n  - The controlling expression uses strcmp(method, ...). To reason about invariance you must know that strcmp is a value-dependent runtime comparison (not a compile-time constant or macro) and that its result depends on the runtime value of method. Confirming strcmp is the standard function rules out unexpected compile-time expansion that could make the expression invariant.\n\n- NULL\n  - The first controlling expression is (NULL == *req_cls). You must know the definition of NULL on the target platform to correctly reason about pointer comparisons and whether that comparison can be evaluated as an invariant constant in the compiled code.\n\n- req_cls lifecycle semantics (initial *req_cls value and preservation across repeated handler invocations)\n  - Whether (NULL == *req_cls) is invariant depends on how the caller/dispatcher initializes and preserves *req_cls between invocations of the handler. The function relies on the convention that *req_cls is NULL on the first invocation and then set to &marker; to determine if the controlling expression can be considered invariant you need the library/callback contract (i.e., that the framework gives NULL the first time and preserves the value for subsequent callbacks).\n\n- num_resps\n  - The code computes resp_index = (last_index++) % num_resps. While this is not itself a controlling expression, understanding whether num_resps is zero (which would make the expression undefined) or whether num_resps is a compile-time constant affects whether any control-flow assumptions (e.g., whether MHD_queue_response will be reached) are always true/false. It is therefore relevant background when judging whether any of the conditionals are effectively invariant in practice.\n\n- resps\n  - The function indexes resps[resp_index] when queuing a response. Knowing whether resps and its elements are constant or mutable affects whether the overall behavior following the controlling expressions is invariant; this is useful context when deciding whether a conditional is semantically invariant (always leading to the same outcome).\n\n- last_index (volatile)\n  - last_index is used in the computation of resp_index and is declared volatile in the function. To reason about invariance (especially across threads or repeated calls) you need to know whether last_index can change between calls (volatile semantics, possible external access) so as to confirm that control expressions depending on its effects are not actually invariant.\n\nTogether these symbols provide the necessary information to decide whether the two controlling expressions in the function ((NULL == *req_cls) and the strcmp-based method check) are invariant under the environment, or whether they genuinely depend on runtime state and thus do not violate the MISRA rule."
