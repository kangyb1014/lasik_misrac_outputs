Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Short rationale for each required symbol (only what is needed to check MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed'):\n\n- MHD_queue_response: The target function calls this function and returns its result. Any for-loops inside MHD_queue_response are part of the called behavior and must be inspected for compliance with the three clauses (loop counter initialization, no persistent side-effects in the second clause, and only loop-counter modification in the third clause). You need the full definition/source of MHD_queue_response.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: Listed as a callee of MHD_queue_response. If MHD_DLOG contains for-loops (or is called from within a for-loop in MHD_queue_response), those loops must be checked. Provide its definition so nested/called loops can be analyzed.\n\n- is_reply_body_needed: Callee of MHD_queue_response. Its implementation may contain for-loops or modify objects used as loop counters in surrounding for-statements; include it to verify any loops it contains or side effects it produces.\n\n- MHD_increment_response_rc: Callee of MHD_queue_response. Include its implementation because it could contain loops or modify objects that are used as loop counters in surrounding loops, affecting MISRA clause 2/3 analysis.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle: Callee of MHD_queue_response. Include its implementation for the same reason: any for-loops it contains or side-effects it performs could affect compliance.\n\n- MHD_update_last_activity_: Callee of MHD_queue_response. Include its implementation because it might contain loops or modify objects that appear in for-loop clauses of MHD_queue_response.\n\n- num_resps: Global used by the target function in the expression (last_index++) % num_resps. To decide whether any for-loop in called functions violates the rule (e.g., uses num_resps in loop clauses while num_resps is modified in loop bodies), you must know the declaration, type, and whether it is modified elsewhere (including inside MHD_queue_response and its callees).\n\n- resps: Global array referenced by the target (resps[resp_index]) and likely referenced by MHD_queue_response or its callees. Its declaration/type and any functions that modify it are required to determine whether loops use or modify the same objects (MISRA forbids loop clauses to reference objects modified in the loop body).\n\nNotes/Scope: The above is a minimal set needed to analyze any for-loops that are reachable from the target function (directly in target or inside MHD_queue_response and its immediate callees). The target function itself has no for-loops; therefore the only potential MISRA violations would come from for-loops in called functions (their bodies count as part of the behaviour). If you want a fully exhaustive check beyond one call level, include the full transitive closure of callees beneath MHD_queue_response and any other functions called transitively that may contain for-loops or modify the listed globals."
