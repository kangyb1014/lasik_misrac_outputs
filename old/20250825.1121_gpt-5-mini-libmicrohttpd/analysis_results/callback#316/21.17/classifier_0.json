  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code returns if pos >= param->response_size, and size_to_copy is set to min(buf_size, param->response_size - pos), so memcpy copies at most the remaining source bytes and no more than the destination buffer. This would only violate the rule if the assumptions are broken (e.g. param->response_data does not actually point to an object of length param->response_size, or param->response_size is changed concurrently), but given the shown logic the memcpy itself does not access out-of-bounds."
