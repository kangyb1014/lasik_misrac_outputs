  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The check 'if (pos >= param->response_size) return ...;' prevents the later memcpy from being called with an offset >= response_size. When this branch is not taken we have pos < response_size, so size_to_copy is computed as (response_size - pos) (bounded by buf_size) and memcpy(buf, param->response_data + pos, size_to_copy) cannot access beyond the response_data object. (Note: this assumes param->response_size correctly reflects the length of response_data and that there are no signed/unsigned type misinterpretations elsewhere.)"
