This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking the memcpy call against the MISRA string-handling bounds rule you must be able to prove the source and destination object sizes and that the pointer arithmetic stays inside those objects. Each listed symbol is required for that proof:\n\n- struct ResponseContentCallbackParam (full definition): the function indexes into param->response_data and reads param->response_size, so you need the full struct declaration to see member names, types and how they are laid out.\n\n- ResponseContentCallbackParam::response_size (type and invariants): the code uses (param->response_size - pos) and casts it to size_t. You must know the exact type (e.g. uint64_t, size_t) and any invariants (non\u2011negativity, maximum values) to check for underflow/overflow and that the computed size_to_copy does not exceed the actual source or destination sizes.\n\n- ResponseContentCallbackParam::response_data (pointer type and allocated object size): to ensure memcpy(src, ...) does not read past the source, you need the allocation size/length of the object pointed to by response_data and confirm that response_size corresponds to that allocated length (or otherwise bound the accessible bytes).\n\n- MHD/content-reader callback contract for parameter 'pos' (specification that pos is an offset and its valid range): the function assumes pos is an offset into the response (comment: \"pos will never exceed size of transmitted data\"). You must have the caller/API guarantee that pos <= response_size and that response_data + pos is a valid pointer into the source object.\n\n- Caller/MHD contract for 'buf' and 'buf_size' (guarantee that buf points to at least buf_size bytes): to ensure memcpy does not write past the destination, you need the caller's guarantee that the destination buffer length is at least buf_size.\n\n- SSIZE_MAX or guarantee that buf_size <= SSIZE_MAX: the code comments cast size_to_copy to ssize_t and claims buf_size < SSIZE_MAX. To validate the cast is safe (not required by MISRA bound rule but present in code), you need the definition/guarantee for SSIZE_MAX relative to buf_size.\n\n- memcpy (standard prototype/semantics): the rule explicitly targets functions from <string.h>. Include the standard prototype/semantics so the analyzer treats this call as the library string copy and applies the MISRA requirement that source and destination bounds are respected.\n\nCollecting these symbols and contracts lets the next analyst demonstrate that the calculated size_to_copy is always <= buf_size (destination bound) and that param->response_data + pos .. + size_to_copy-1 lies within the allocated source object (source bound), thereby proving or disproving compliance with the MISRA rule."
