  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The only relevant library function call is memcpy, which copies bytes and is not restricted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). Other fragments (the checks on pos vs. response_size, calculation of size_to_copy, the memcpy call, and the various return values and casts) do not involve memcmp or string comparisons and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.14. If memcmp were present (e.g. comparing response_data or buf against a string literal or NUL-terminated C string), those occurrences should be flagged; none are in the supplied code."
