  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (memcmp must not be used to compare NUL-terminated strings):\n\n- struct ResponseContentCallbackParam: You must inspect the full definition to know the semantics of the fields (especially whether the data is text/string or binary). Whether memcmp would be illegal depends on whether the buffer is a NUL-terminated C string.\n\n- ResponseContentCallbackParam.response_data: You need the exact type (char * or otherwise), ownership/encoding comments, and whether it is guaranteed to be NUL-terminated. If response_data is a C string, using memcmp to compare it would violate the MISRA rule; if it is arbitrary binary data, memcmp may be acceptable.\n\n- ResponseContentCallbackParam.response_size: You must know whether response_size counts bytes excluding/including the terminating NUL (if any) and whether it describes length of string vs. buffer size. This determines whether comparisons/copies in this function treat the data as string or raw bytes.\n\n- functions that allocate/initialize/populate ResponseContentCallbackParam (creators/initializers): To determine the origin and properties of response_data (e.g., assigned from strdup/strcpy/JSON serialization/binary read), inspect the code that sets response_data/response_size. That reveals if the data is produced as a null-terminated string or as binary blob (and whether a terminating NUL is present).\n\n- memcpy (standard library): Confirm that the code uses memcpy (a byte copy) and not memcmp; also check whether memcpy is a macro or replaced by a project wrapper. Verifying its identity ensures no accidental use of memcmp-like semantics.\n\n- memcmp (standard library): The rule targets memcmp usage. You must search for memcmp calls in this function and in any wrappers called here (or macros that expand to memcmp). If memcmp is not present anywhere reachable from this callback (directly or via wrappers/macros), the rule is not violated here.\n\n- any macros or inline wrappers that alias or replace memcpy/memcmp (project-specific wrappers): Projects sometimes define my_memcpy, MEMCPY, etc., or redefine memcpy/memcmp via macros. To be sure the function does not end up invoking memcmp (directly or indirectly), inspect such aliases used in this module/build.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: These symbols are used as return values in the function; include them so the analyzer has the complete context of return semantics (not directly related to memcmp rule, but required as close symbols for complete analysis of this callback).\n\n- ssize_t, size_t, SSIZE_MAX, uint64_t (typedefs / macros used in signature and comments): Types and macros used in the signature/comments are needed so the analyzer can correctly reason about sizes/limits and casts (e.g., whether converting size_to_copy to ssize_t is safe). While not directly about memcmp, they are close symbols required for correct semantic analysis of buffer/length handling which is relevant to deciding whether string comparisons (vs. byte comparisons) are being done.\n\nSummary: The key items to decide MISRA compliance are the definition/semantics of ResponseContentCallbackParam (especially response_data and response_size), and any occurrences or aliases of memcmp in the reachable code. The rest (memcpy, wrappers, type/macros, MHD constants) are included so the analyzer has a complete, unambiguous view of how data is produced, copied, and whether any memcmp-based string comparisons occur."
