  "explanation": "To determine whether callback() violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect recursion we must examine all call targets and any symbols that could introduce further call chains.\n\n- memcpy\n  - Reason: memcpy is the only explicit function called by callback. To detect indirect recursion we must know the actual implementation (or any user-provided override) of memcpy in the build: if memcpy (or a wrapper/macro mapping to it) calls back into application code, it could lead to an indirect call to callback. Establishing whether memcpy is a plain library function with no calls into callback (or into user hooks that call callback) is necessary.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM\n  - Reason: This identifier is returned by callback. It may be a macro or an expression that expands to a function call or to a symbol that triggers code execution (e.g. a function-like macro or inline function). Verify it is a constant/enum (no function call) so it cannot introduce recursion.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR\n  - Reason: Same rationale as above: the token used in a return may be a macro/inline function. Confirming it is a simple constant ensures no hidden calls are introduced through the return value.\n\n- struct ResponseContentCallbackParam (full definition: members, types, and any function-pointer members)\n  - Reason: callback casts cls to this struct and accesses response_size and response_data. The struct definition must be inspected to ensure it contains no function-pointer members or accessor macros that could invoke functions (which might call callback). Also check whether response_data actually refers to a buffer or to an object with destructor/hooks or methods that are invoked implicitly. Any function pointers or accessor macros inside the struct could produce indirect call paths to callback, so their presence or absence is required for the recursion analysis.\n\nProvide these symbols/definitions so the next agent can expand the call graph from callback and determine whether any direct or indirect path leads back to callback."
