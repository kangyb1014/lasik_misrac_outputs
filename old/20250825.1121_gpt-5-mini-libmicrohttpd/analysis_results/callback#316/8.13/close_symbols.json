  "explanation": "1) struct ResponseContentCallbackParam: You must see the actual definition to know whether its members are already const-qualified. The MISRA rule concerns the pointed-to type: if response_data is declared as 'char *' the code likely violates the rule because it treats the buffer as read-only; if it's 'const char *' there is no violation.  \n\n2) struct ResponseContentCallbackParam::response_data: The exact declared type of this member (char * vs const char *) is the primary symbol needed to decide compliance. The code reads from response_data only, so MISRA would prefer 'const char *' if the data is not modified anywhere.  \n\n3) struct ResponseContentCallbackParam::response_size: Knowing the declared type (and whether it is const) is needed to confirm that the pointer arithmetic/uses do not require mutable access to the struct; e.g. if response_size is mutable and the API expects to modify the struct via the callback pointer, that affects whether the struct (or cls) can be const.  \n\n4) MHD_ContentReaderCallback (framework callback prototype / typedef): The framework/library typedef for the callback determines whether the first parameter (void *cls) is required to be plain void * (non-const) by the API. If the API signature requires void *cls, you cannot change the callback prototype to take 'const void *' even if the implementation does not modify the pointed data; that is relevant to deciding whether the current code violates MISRA or is constrained by the external API.  \n\n5) memcpy (declaration from <string.h>): The memcpy prototype (void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n)) documents that the source parameter is a const void *. This matters because it shows memcpy accepts a const source buffer; therefore using a const-qualified response_data would be compatible with the call here. \n\nThese symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether pointers in this function could/should be const-qualified (and whether changing them is permitted by the external API)."
