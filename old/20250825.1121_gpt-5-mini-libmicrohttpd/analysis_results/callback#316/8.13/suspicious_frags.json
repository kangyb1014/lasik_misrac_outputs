  "explanation": "The only places that may violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 are where a pointer to an object is declared/accepted without const qualification even though the code only reads the object: the function parameter 'cls' is declared as void * (non-const) and is cast to a non-const pointer to the ResponseContentCallbackParam type. These should be investigated to determine whether they should be declared as const (for example: const void *cls and const struct ResponseContentCallbackParam *const param). Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - 'char *buf' is a writable destination buffer (should not be const). - 'param->response_data' is already a const char * in the struct definition (no issue). - The memcpy call uses the const-qualified source and a non-const destination as expected. - Arithmetic on 'pos' and 'response_size' and the size-to-ssize_t cast are unrelated to pointer const qualification."
