Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide if the controlling expressions are invariant:\n\n1) struct ResponseContentCallbackParam (full definition)\n   - The controlling expressions compare and subtract param->response_size (e.g. pos >= param->response_size and param->response_size - pos). To determine whether those expressions can be constant (always true/false) you must know the declared type of response_size (signed/unsigned width) and whether it can change during the lifetime of the callback object. The definition also shows whether response_size is const-qualified or otherwise immutable.\n\n2) Location / code that initializes/sets param->response_size\n   - Even if response_size's type permits change, the actual program semantics (is it set once and never changed?) matter for invariance. The site(s) that set response_size establish whether param->response_size is invariant across invocations of the callback (a true source of an invariant controlling expression).\n\n3) Microhttpd callback invocation contract (API that calls this callback)\n   - The expressions use the parameter pos which is supplied by the HTTP library. To know whether pos can vary between calls (or is guaranteed to be a certain value or monotonic), you must inspect the caller semantics: how the library increments/initializes pos, whether it can call the callback with the same pos repeatedly, and whether pos can ever exceed response_size. If the API guarantees e.g. pos never exceeds response_size or always increases, that affects whether the comparisons are potentially invariant.\n\n4) Type definitions and ranges for uint64_t, size_t and ssize_t (platform-specific)\n   - The comparisons and the subtraction involve unsigned and signed types; wraparound/underflow behaviour for unsigned arithmetic can make expressions unexpectedly invariant (e.g. large unsigned subtraction). Knowing exact widths and signedness and SSIZE_MAX is necessary to reason about casts (size_t -> ssize_t), the safety assertions in comments, and whether (param->response_size - pos) can underflow or be constant due to type limits.\n\n5) MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR definitions\n   - While these values are not directly part of the controlling expressions, understanding what the function returns on the invariant branch (end-of-stream vs error) matters to determine whether the library or caller will change its behaviour (e.g. suspend callback invocation). The return values can affect whether the callback will be invoked again with different pos values, which is relevant to whether a controlling expression is effectively invariant during the observable control flow.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine: the signedness and range semantics of the operands in the controlling expressions; whether the operands are actually constant for the lifetime of the callback; and whether library/caller behaviour makes the expressions effectively invariant (always true/false) \u2014 which is what MISRA\u2019s rule requires checking."
