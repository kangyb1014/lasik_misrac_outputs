  "explanation": "No active controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. The function contains only the following conditional statements: 1) if (pos >= param->response_size) \u2014 depends on the parameters pos and param->response_size and therefore is not an invariant; 2) if (buf_size < (param->response_size - pos)) \u2014 depends on buf_size, param->response_size and pos so it is not invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements whose controlling expressions are constant. The two pseudo-code if-statements are inside block comments and are not active code, so they cannot violate Rule 14.3 in this translation unit. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
