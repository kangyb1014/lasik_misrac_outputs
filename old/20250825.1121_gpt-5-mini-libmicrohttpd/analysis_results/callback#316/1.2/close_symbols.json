  "explanation": "For checking whether this function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions that the function relies on, because extensions can be hidden in typedefs, struct members or macro definitions. Explainations:\n\n- ssize_t: Not a C90 standard type (usually POSIX). You must see its typedef to determine whether it is implemented using a compiler extension (e.g. as a non\u2011standard typedef or via an extension type such as a compiler built\u2011in signed type). Also the safety comment about casting to ssize_t depends on its width and limits.\n\n- uint64_t: A typedef from <stdint.h> (C99). Inspect its definition to ensure it is a standard typedef and not provided via a compiler extension or unusual implementation-specific type.\n\n- size_t: Standard C type but implementation defined; inspect its typedef to ensure no extension is used (and to reason about conversions and casts in the function).\n\n- struct ResponseContentCallbackParam: You must examine the struct definition to detect any language extensions used in it (for example zero-length arrays (GCC extension), compiler-specific attributes on the struct or members, bit\u2011fields with non\u2011standard widths, flexible array vs zero\u2011length array differences, or non\u2011standard storage\u2011class/qualifier usage).\n\n- param->response_size: The exact type of this member (within the struct) matters for integer promotions/conversions with pos (uint64_t) and for detecting any non\u2011standard integer types or macros used to declare it.\n\n- param->response_data: The exact declaration (pointer, array, flexible array, zero\u2011length array) is needed to determine if a language extension (e.g. GCC zero-length arrays or attributes on the member) is used.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: This macro/constant must be inspected to see whether it is defined with any compiler\u2011specific extension (e.g. type suffixes, GNU statement expressions, __extension__ constructs, attributes, or non\u2011portable literal forms).\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: Same reason as above \u2014 the macro body/definition may use compiler extensions that render the function non\u2011conforming.\n\n- memcpy: The prototype (usually from <string.h>) is standard C; include it to verify no non\u2011standard shadowing or replacements (e.g. a macro or inline/attribute version using compiler extensions) is in scope.\n\n- SSIZE_MAX: Mentioned in the comment and used to justify a cast; inspect its definition to ensure it is a standard macro and not implemented via an extension or non\u2011standard type width.\n\nCollecting these symbols and reviewing their definitions will allow determining whether any compiler\u2011specific language extensions are used by the target function (either directly in the code shown or indirectly via the types/macros it depends on)."
