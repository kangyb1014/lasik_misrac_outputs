The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining active code constructs must be retained for correct behaviour and therefore are not suspected dead code: the cast and assignment of 'param' is used throughout the function; the end-of-stream check (if (pos >= param->response_size) return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM;) determines when no more data should be sent; the calculation of 'size_to_copy' (the if/else using buf_size and response_size - pos) and the subsequent memcpy are required to copy the correct portion of the response into the provided buffer; the final return of (ssize_t) size_to_copy reports how many bytes were written. Removing any of those active statements would change the function's behaviour, so they do not meet the definition of dead code and do not need further investigation under Rule 2.2."
