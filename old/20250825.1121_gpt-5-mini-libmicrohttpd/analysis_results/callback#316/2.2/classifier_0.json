  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of callback:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\ncallback (void *cls,\n          uint64_t pos,\n          char *buf,\n          size_t buf_size)\n{\n  size_t size_to_copy;\n  struct ResponseContentCallbackParam *const param =\n    (struct ResponseContentCallbackParam *) cls;\n\n  /* Note: 'pos' will never exceed size of transmitted data. */\n  /* You can use 'pos == param->response_size' in next check. */\n  if (pos >= param->response_size)\n  {   /* Whole response was sent.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is a block comment containing pseudo-code (not compiled or executed), so it cannot be 'dead code' as defined by MISRA 2.2 (dead code is code that is executed but removable without changing behaviour). If the pseudo-code were converted to actual executable code and it executed but had no effect on program behaviour, that real code could violate Rule 2.2, but as presented there is no violation."
