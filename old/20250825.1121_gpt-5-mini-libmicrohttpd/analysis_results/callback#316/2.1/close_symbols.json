  "explanation": "To decide whether any branch in callback() is provably unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) you must know the concrete definitions and calling contract that affect the control flow and the tests in this function:\n\n- struct ResponseContentCallbackParam: the full type definition is required to know the exact layout, types and semantics of its members. Without it you cannot determine what values response_size/response_data can hold or whether accesses are valid.\n\n- ResponseContentCallbackParam::response_size: the type and semantic meaning of response_size (signed/unsigned width, constraints, whether it can change while callback is in use) determine whether the test if (pos >= param->response_size) can ever be true or false and whether the subtraction (param->response_size - pos) can underflow. This directly affects whether branches (the end-of-stream return or the else branch) can be reached.\n\n- ResponseContentCallbackParam::response_data: the pointer type and semantics (ownership, immutability, possible side effects) are required to understand whether memcpy() can fail or whether the data pointer forces different control-flow in the caller (e.g. if data is always empty making some branches unreachable).\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: its definition/value and documented meaning are required to know the effect of returning it (e.g. whether the caller will ever invoke the callback again after this return). If returning this value guarantees the callback is never called again, code paths that handle subsequent invocations may be unreachable.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: same as above \u2014 its value and the caller behaviour on this return determine whether code after such a return or alternative error handling branches could be reached.\n\n- MHD_ContentReaderCallback / the content-reader invocation routine (for example MHD_create_response_from_callback) and its caller implementation/documentation: the runtime contract for how and when the callback is invoked, how 'pos' is generated and whether the callback can be invoked with pos values equal/greater than response_size, whether callbacks may be retried after returning 0, END_OF_STREAM or END_WITH_ERROR, and whether the library ever calls the callback after an END_OF_STREAM return are all necessary to prove reachability or unreachability of branches in this function.\n\nTogether these symbols provide the type-level information and the external calling semantics needed to determine if any branch or return in callback() is impossible and therefore unreachable."
