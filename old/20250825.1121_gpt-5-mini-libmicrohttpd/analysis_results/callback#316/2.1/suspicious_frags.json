  "explanation": "I found no unreachable code fragments in the provided function. Reasoning:\n\n- Control-flow: the function has two explicit return points that cover all possible runtime paths: if (pos >= param->response_size) returns MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM; otherwise execution continues, computes size_to_copy, performs memcpy and returns (ssize_t)size_to_copy. There is no path through the function that falls through without returning.\n\n- The conditional that selects size_to_copy has both branches reachable depending on the comparison between buf_size and (param->response_size - pos); neither branch is statically impossible given the types and no stronger invariants in the code.\n\n- The commented pseudo-code blocks that show alternative early returns (return 0; return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;) are comments, not executable code, so they are not unreachable code \u2014 they are simply inactive text.\n\n- Definitions of MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and END_WITH_ERROR are used as return values and are reachable (the first via the pos check; the second would be reachable only if active code returned it, but no unreachable code exists because it is not present).\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied function that appear to be unreachable and that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. If you want, I can instead point out other potential issues (e.g. lack of null-check for cls/param, assumptions about buf_size < SSIZE_MAX) \u2014 but those are not unreachable-code concerns."
