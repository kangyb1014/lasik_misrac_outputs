  "explanation": "- struct ResponseContentCallbackParam: The function casts the void* parameter 'cls' to this struct pointer. The struct definition is required to determine whether accessing its fields or the cast itself could implicitly modify the parameter object or the pointer value (e.g. if any accessor macros or overloaded semantics are hidden in its definition).\n\n- struct ResponseContentCallbackParam::response_size: The code reads this field to compare with 'pos' and to compute the number of bytes copied. Knowing its declared type (and whether it is a modifiable lvalue) is necessary to determine if any code paths modify the field or the object pointed-to by 'cls'.\n\n- struct ResponseContentCallbackParam::response_data: The code uses this field as the source passed to memcpy. Its type (e.g. const char * vs char *) determines whether the function is attempting to modify the object pointed-to by response_data (which would be relevant to whether pointer targets are modified, allowed by MISRA) and confirms that only the object pointed-to by 'buf' is written.\n\n- memcpy: The prototype (void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n)) shows that memcpy writes into the object pointed-to by its first argument (buf) but does not modify the pointer argument itself. This is needed to conclude that the function modifies the object pointed-to by 'buf' (allowed) rather than reassigning the pointer parameter (disallowed).\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: These macros/values are returned directly. Their definitions are required to ensure they are simple constants (no hidden side effects or function-like macros that might alter parameters) and that their types are compatible with ssize_t. If they were implemented as macros/functions with side effects they could potentially modify parameters.\n\n- ssize_t and SSIZE_MAX: ssize_t is the function return type; SSIZE_MAX is referenced in the comment regarding safe casting. Their definitions help confirm the cast and return value do not rely on hidden behavior that could imply modification of input parameters.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the code reassigns any of the formal parameters (cls, pos, buf, buf_size) or only mutates the objects they point to (which the MISRA rule permits)."
