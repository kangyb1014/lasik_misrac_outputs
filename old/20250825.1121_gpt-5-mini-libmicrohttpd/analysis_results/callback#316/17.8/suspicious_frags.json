  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameters (cls and buf) are not reassigned anywhere; the only pointer variable introduced (param) is declared as a const pointer (struct ResponseContentCallbackParam *const param), so the pointer itself is not modified.\n- The object pointed to by buf is written via memcpy, which is allowed by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified).\n- The scalar parameters pos and buf_size are read but never assigned to or altered.\n- The cast of cls to a struct pointer does not modify the parameter variable itself.\n- Return statements and macro constants do not modify parameters.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function; nothing needs to be flagged for investigation under that rule."
