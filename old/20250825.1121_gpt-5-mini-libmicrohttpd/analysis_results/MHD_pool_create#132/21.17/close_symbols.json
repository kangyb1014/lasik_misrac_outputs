This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- struct MemoryPool: required to know the type and semantics of pool->memory, pool->size, pool->pos, pool->end and pool->is_mmap. To determine whether any string handling function (e.g. memset/memcpy used elsewhere) could access beyond the allocated object, we must know the pointer type and the meaning/units of pool->size and that these fields actually correspond to the allocated buffer and its length.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: this macro/function is invoked with (pool->memory, pool->size). It may expand to or call standard string.h routines (commonly memset). To decide if any string function is used out-of-bounds we must inspect its implementation/expansion and parameter handling.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: used to compute alloc_size when mmap failed. We must verify that ROUND_TO_ALIGN(max) produces a size >= max (and does not underflow/produce a smaller size), so that later writes of size pool->size cannot exceed the allocated buffer. If ROUND_TO_ALIGN uses any string functions internally, that also must be checked.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: used in the alignment assertion and likely related to rounding macros. Its value is needed to validate the alignment check and to understand any relationship with ROUND_TO_ALIGN or buffer sizes that could affect correctness of subsequent memory writes.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: used when rounding up max to page granularity for mmap allocations. We need its value/type to confirm that alloc_size computed for mmap is >= max and thus pool->size reflects the actual allocated region size; any mismatch could cause out-of-bounds accesses by string functions.\n\n- mhd_assert: the function uses assertions (mhd_assert) to check preconditions (max > 0, alloc_size > 0, alignment). We need its definition/behavior to know whether these checks can be relied on (for example, whether they are compiled out) when reasoning about possible out-of-bounds calls to string.h routines (particularly _MHD_POISON_MEMORY)."
