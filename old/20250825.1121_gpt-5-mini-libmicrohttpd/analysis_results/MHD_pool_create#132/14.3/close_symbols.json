  "explanation": "- MAP_ANONYMOUS: The preprocessor test #if defined(MAP_ANONYMOUS) || defined(_WIN32) controls whether the code attempts mmap/VirtualAlloc or falls through to the #else that unconditionally sets pool->memory = MAP_FAILED. Whether this macro is defined determines which branches exist in the compiled code and therefore whether later if (MAP_FAILED == pool->memory) is effectively invariant.\n- _WIN32: Same reason as MAP_ANONYMOUS; presence of this macro switches compilation to the Windows allocation path (VirtualAlloc) and prevents the unconditional assignment to MAP_FAILED in the #else branch.\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: Used in the runtime controlling expression (max < MHD_sys_page_size_ * 4 / 3). To decide if that controlling expression (and thus the allocation branch taken) can be considered invariant in the compiled program you must know this symbol's value/definition.\n- MAP_FAILED: The code assigns and compares pool->memory to MAP_FAILED. Knowing the exact sentinel/value and type is necessary to reason whether the comparison if (MAP_FAILED == pool->memory) can ever be false at runtime or is necessarily true (invariant) given earlier assignments.\n- struct MemoryPool (definition: types of memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size): You must know the type of pool->memory (pointer type) and the semantics of the members to understand assignments/comparisons and whether earlier assignments make later comparisons invariant.\n- mmap: When MAP_ANONYMOUS is defined (and not _WIN32) the code may call mmap to set pool->memory. To determine if pool->memory can differ from MAP_FAILED at runtime (making the subsequent if non-invariant) you need to know whether mmap is available and its failure return value semantics.\n- VirtualAlloc: On _WIN32 the code may call VirtualAlloc; similarly you need its availability and failure semantics to know whether pool->memory can be something other than MAP_FAILED at runtime.\n\nThese symbols are the ones that affect which branches are compiled and whether pool->memory is unconditionally set to MAP_FAILED (which would make the later controlling expression invariant). Other symbols (malloc/free, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ALIGN_SIZE, mhd_assert) do not change the control-flow invariance analysis and therefore are not required to decide the MISRA issue at hand."
