  "explanation": "I found no loop controlling expressions in the supplied function that could be invariant. MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 concerns loop controlling expressions (while, do-while, for) that are constant/invariant. The code contains only if/else conditionals and preprocessor conditionals:\n\n- Preprocessor #if/#elif directives (e.g. #if defined(MAP_ANONYMOUS) || defined(_WIN32)) are evaluated at compile time and are not C controlling expressions governed by Rule 14.3.\n- The if expressions (e.g. if ((max <= 32 * 1024) || (max < MHD_sys_page_size_ * 4 / 3)), if (NULL == pool), if (MAP_FAILED == pool->memory), etc.) depend on runtime values (function parameter max, allocation results, pool->memory) and are therefore not invariant.\n- There are no for, while, or do-while loops present in MHD_pool_create; hence the exceptions for infinite loops or do-while with constant false are not applicable.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation under Rule 14.3."
