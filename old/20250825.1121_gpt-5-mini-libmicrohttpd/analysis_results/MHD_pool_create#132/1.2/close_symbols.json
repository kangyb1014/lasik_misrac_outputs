  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is referenced (directly or via macros) in MHD_pool_create and must be inspected to determine whether any compiler/language extensions are being used in their definitions or implementations:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: needed to see the exact field types (memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size). The analysis must confirm there are no non\u2011standard/implementation extensions in the type (flexible-array members, bit\u2011fields with implementation-specific widths, or compiler attributes on fields).\n\n- mhd_assert: typically a macro; its definition may use compiler extensions (statement-expressions, __attribute__, __builtin_expect, __extension__ or other compiler builtins). Inspect to ensure it is standard C macro/inline code.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: a macro used to touch/initialize memory; may use inline assembly, compiler builtins, or GCC/Clang extensions. Its body must be checked for extensions.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN and ALIGN_SIZE: alignment helpers are commonly implemented with compiler intrinsics or GCC extensions (e.g. __alignof__, __attribute__((aligned)), or statement expressions). Their definitions must be checked for use of extensions.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: could be a macro, global variable, or inline function; its definition may rely on platform or compiler extensions. Need to know how page size is obtained/defined.\n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS, MAP_FAILED, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE: platform macros used with mmap; their definitions are system macros \u2014 inspect to ensure they are not defined via compiler extensions (unlikely, but check MAP_FAILED if defined as ((void *) -1) and any unusual casting or extension usage).\n\n- mmap: system call wrapper; implementation may be provided via headers that use builtins or inline assembly \u2014 include to verify no compiler extensions are being relied upon in the wrapper available to this build.\n\n- VirtualAlloc, MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE: Windows API symbols. Their presence/headers may introduce platform\u2011specific macros or compiler extensions; definition/headers should be checked for extension use when _WIN32 is active.\n\n- malloc, free: standard library functions; include to verify standard prototypes are used and no non\u2011standard variants or macros (e.g. wrappers using extensions) replace them.\n\n- size_t: type used in the function signature and local variables; verify that the typedef comes from a standard header and no compiler extension is redefining it.\n\n- uintptr_t: integer type used in pointer arithmetic and alignment checks. It is a C99 type; verify that the project provides it via standard headers and it is not a compiler extension alias.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions of all macros, inline helpers, typedefs and platform APIs referenced in the function to ensure none are implemented using compiler language extensions (statement expressions, typeof, __attribute__ uses that change semantics, builtin intrinsics, inline asm, or other documented compiler extensions)."
