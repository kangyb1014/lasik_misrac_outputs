  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because all pointers in the provided code are used in ways that require mutable (non-const) access:\n\n- pool (struct MemoryPool *pool): the function allocates and then writes multiple mutable fields (memory, pos, end, size, is_mmap). The object pointed to must be modifiable, so a const-qualified pointer would be inappropriate.\n\n- pool->memory (uint8_t *memory): this pointer refers to the pool storage that will be used for allocations and is (potentially) written to (e.g. by allocation consumers and by the _MHD_POISON_MEMORY macro). That storage must be mutable, so the pointer should not be to const-qualified data.\n\n- The function return type (struct MemoryPool *): callers are expected to modify the returned pool (manage allocations, free, etc.), so returning a pointer-to-const would be incorrect.\n\n- Assignments from mmap/VirtualAlloc/malloc and use of MAP_FAILED/NULL: these simply initialize pool->memory with raw, mutable storage pointers (or MAP_FAILED sentinel). They do not indicate that the pointed-to storage is immutable.\n\nBecause each pointer is either used to modify the pointed-to object or represents ownership of mutable storage, making them point to const-qualified types would be inappropriate; therefore there are no fragments that violate or likely violate Rule 8.13 in this function."
