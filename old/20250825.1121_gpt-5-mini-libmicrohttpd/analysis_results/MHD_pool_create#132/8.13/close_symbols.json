  "explanation": "For assessing whether pointers in MHD_pool_create should be const-qualified, the next analyst must know the declared types and how the memory is used:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: needed to see the declaration of the pool structure (in particular the type and const qualifiers, if any, of fields such as memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size). This determines whether the field already has const and what type a pointer points to.\n\n- pool->memory (field type in struct MemoryPool): explicitly call out the exact declared type of the memory field (e.g., void *, char *, uint8_t *, const void *, etc.). The MISRA rule applies to the pointer's target type; knowing the exact type is essential.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: this macro/function is invoked on pool->memory; its definition is required to know whether it writes to the pointed memory (which would forbid making the pointer-to-data const) or only reads/checks (which might allow const qualification).\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: used to compute alloc_size when falling back to malloc. Its definition may affect whether sizes/pointer arithmetic imply mutation or alignment requirements relevant to pointer constness.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: used in the alignment assertion (modulo). Knowing its value/type matters when interpreting the uintptr_t cast and whether pointer arithmetic or alignment manipulations are performed on the pointer target.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: its type and usage matter for the decision path that selects mmap/VirtualAlloc vs malloc; this affects whether memory is obtained as writable mapping or heap allocation (influences whether data is intended to be modified).\n\n- MAP_FAILED: its definition/type (usually (void *) -1) is used in comparisons; confirming its type ensures pool->memory is a pointer type and whether const qualification is consistent with comparisons.\n\n- mmap (semantics & return type): need to know that mmap returns a pointer to memory mapped with given protections; combined with PROT_WRITE it indicates the mapping is writable (so pointer should not be const-qualified if writes are performed).\n\n- VirtualAlloc (semantics & return type): on Windows this returns a writable memory area when PAGE_READWRITE is used. Knowing this confirms whether the mapping is writable.\n\n- PROT_WRITE / PROT_READ: these flags used with mmap indicate whether the mapped memory is writable; if writable, the pointed-to type should not be const.\n\n- PAGE_READWRITE: Windows equivalent of writable mapping; required to conclude whether VirtualAlloc returns writable memory.\n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS and MAP_PRIVATE: the presence/absence of these macros affects the code path chosen for obtaining memory and therefore whether the memory is intended to be writable/mutable.\n\n(Other standard types such as size_t and uintptr_t are assumed known; malloc/free signatures are not necessary to decide const-qualification here. The items above are the minimal symbols needed to decide whether pool->memory and related pointers can/should be const-qualified.)"
