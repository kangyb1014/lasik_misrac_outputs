  "explanation": "To determine whether the parameter 'max' is ever modified (directly or indirectly) inside MHD_pool_create you must inspect any macros or functions used with or around 'max' and any symbol that could expand to code that assigns to the parameter. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- mhd_assert: It is invoked with 'max'. A macro definition could expand to statements that modify local variables (including the parameter) \u2014 must verify it does not assign to 'max'.\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: Used as ROUND_TO_ALIGN(max). Could be a macro that performs assignments or side effects; need its definition to ensure it does not modify the parameter.\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: Called with pool->memory and pool->size; while it doesn't take 'max' directly, it is a macro/function used in the function body \u2014 if it is a macro it might expand into code that references/assigns local identifiers; verify it doesn't modify 'max'.\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: Used in arithmetic with 'max'. Could be a macro or global; its definition or type is required to confirm no macro expansion affects 'max'.\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Used in the mhd_assert that checks alignment of pool->memory. It may be a macro; need to ensure its expansion doesn't touch 'max'.\n- struct MemoryPool (definition and fields: memory, pos, end, size, is_mmap): Needed to ensure accesses like pool->memory, pool->pos, pool->end, pool->size, pool->is_mmap do not alias or overlap with the parameter storage (very unlikely for a by-value size_t but required for complete analysis).\n- malloc / free: Called in this function. While 'max' is passed by value (not to these calls), confirm that any macros/wrappers or custom implementations do not use/combine parameter names in odd ways; inspect implementations if they are macro-wrapped.\n- mmap / VirtualAlloc: Called (or referenced) inside conditional compilation paths; if they are macro-wrapped or overridden by project-specific macros they could expand to code that touches local variables \u2014 include to check for hidden modifications.\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS, _WIN32, MAP_FAILED, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE: Preprocessor symbols and constants used in conditional compilation and assignments (e.g., pool->memory = MAP_FAILED). Their definitions matter for macro expansion and to ensure no macro aliasing hides an assignment to the parameter.\n- uintptr_t: Used in the cast in the assertion; need its definition (typedef) only to ensure no surprising macro behavior around that identifier.\n\nIn short, focus on macros and any project-specific wrapper functions used with 'max' or elsewhere in the function (mhd_assert, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, _MHD_POISON_MEMORY) and the MemoryPool type; also inspect any macros that might redefine standard calls (malloc, mmap, VirtualAlloc) or the constants used in conditional compilation. These symbols collectively let an analyzer confirm that no expansion or side-effect assigns to the parameter 'max', satisfying the MISRA rule check."
