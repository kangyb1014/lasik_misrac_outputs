  "explanation": "For determining whether any part of MHD_pool_create is compile- or effectively unreachable, the analyzer must know the following symbols and why:\n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS: Preprocessor feature test; the top-level #if uses this. Whether it is defined makes large code blocks present or removed -> affects compile-time reachability.\n- _WIN32: Preprocessor feature test; used together with MAP_ANONYMOUS and in nested #if to choose VirtualAlloc vs mmap. Its presence/absence changes which branches are compiled and therefore whether code is unreachable.\n- MAP_FAILED: Value compared against pool->memory after mapping. If defined to a special constant or macro could affect logic used to decide fallback path; needed to reason about reachable runtime paths following mapping.\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: Value (global) used in the runtime condition (max < MHD_sys_page_size_ * 4 / 3). If this is a compile-time constant or known value it can make the branch outcome fixed; if not, it is a runtime-dependent value and the branch is reachable.\n- mmap: The mmap call is compiled only when MAP_ANONYMOUS && ! _WIN32; its availability/semantics determine whether the mmap branch is meaningful or unreachable in the build configuration.\n- VirtualAlloc: Likewise, compiled only when _WIN32; its presence makes the Windows mapping branch reachable in that configuration.\n- malloc: Used to allocate struct MemoryPool and the fallback allocation. If malloc is replaced/disabled (or a macro that aborts), code following allocations could be unreachable; also needed to analyze the fallback path.\n- free: Called on failure of pool->memory allocation; its semantics could affect reachability of subsequent return paths (and is part of the failure-handling path analysis).\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: Macro or function used to compute alloc_size for the malloc fallback. If it is a compile-time constant expansion or has side effects it can affect whether subsequent code is reachable or not.\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Used in the assert checking alignment. If ALIGN_SIZE is 0 or some compile-time value it can make the assertion always true/false; assertions that terminate in some builds can create unreachable code after them.\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: Macro invoked before return. It may be a no-op or could contain code (including calls or traps) that affect reachability/side effects; needed to know whether code after it (here return) is reachable in all builds.\n- mhd_assert: Assertion macro used twice. If mhd_assert expands to an abort/trap in some builds, code after an assertion that is always triggered could be unreachable. The analyzer needs its definition to decide if assertions create unreachable code.\n- struct MemoryPool: Full type definition (fields memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size). Knowing whether writing these fields has side effects (e.g., bitfields, volatile, or special attributes) or how large pool->memory can be affects understanding of control-flow and whether some code is semantically unreachable.\n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE: Mapping flags/constants used in the platform-specific mapping calls. Their presence/definitions determine whether the platform-specific branch compiles and thus whether the related code is reachable in that build.\n\nIn short: the preprocessor macros that control which branches are compiled (MAP_ANONYMOUS, _WIN32) plus the platform-specific APIs (mmap, VirtualAlloc and their flags), the assertion/poison macros (mhd_assert, _MHD_POISON_MEMORY), allocation/fallback helpers (malloc, free, ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ALIGN_SIZE) and the runtime page-size symbol (MHD_sys_page_size_) are required to decide whether any source lines in MHD_pool_create are unreachable in the project build(s)."
