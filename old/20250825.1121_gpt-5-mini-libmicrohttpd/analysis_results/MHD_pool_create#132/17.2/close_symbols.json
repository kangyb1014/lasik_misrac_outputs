  "explanation": "new_connection_process_: direct caller of MHD_pool_create \u2014 must be examined to see whether it (or anything it calls) can call MHD_pool_create back, creating indirect recursion.\nMHD_DLOG: a callee of new_connection_process_. Although typically a logger, it must be checked (or at least ruled out) as a potential path back to MHD_pool_create.\n__builtin_unreachable: listed as a callee of new_connection_process_. This is a compiler intrinsic (not a real call target) and is effectively irrelevant for recursion, but included to document and explicitly rule it out.\nMHD_connection_set_initial_state_: callee of new_connection_process_. Could transitively call MHD_pool_create; must be inspected for any path back to MHD_pool_create.\nMHD_create_named_thread_: callee of new_connection_process_. Thread-creation entry points can start code that may call MHD_pool_create; include to check transitive calls launched in new threads.\nMHD_pool_destroy: callee of new_connection_process_. Although a destructor, it may reference pool creation code or call routines that in turn call MHD_pool_create; include to rule out cycles.\nMHD_ip_limit_del: callee of new_connection_process_. Included because any callee may contain a transitive call back to MHD_pool_create and thus form an indirect recursion.\ninternal_add_connection: caller of new_connection_process_. Include to inspect higher-level call chains that might close a cycle involving MHD_pool_create.\nnew_connections_list_process_: caller of new_connection_process_. Include for the same reason as internal_add_connection \u2014 to analyze transitive caller\u2013callee paths that could produce an indirect call back to MHD_pool_create.\n\nNote: The goal is to examine all direct callers of MHD_pool_create and their transitive callees/callers that could form a cycle. The listed symbols are the minimal set visible from the provided static call graph that must be inspected (or demonstrated not to call back) to conclude whether MHD_pool_create participates in direct or indirect recursion."
