  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_pool_create violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings we must inspect any called macros/functions or data definitions used by the function that might themselves call memcmp on strings. The required symbols and why they are needed:\n\n- mhd_assert: This macro/function is invoked at the start and later in the function. Its implementation could expand to code that performs string comparisons (for example, building diagnostic messages or checking conditions using helper routines). Inspecting mhd_assert confirms it does not call memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: This macro is invoked on the allocated memory region and could conceal calls to memory/string utilities (e.g., memcmp, memcpy, memset) as part of poisoning logic. We must examine its definition to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: This macro or inline helper computes alloc_size. Although unlikely to involve string comparison, it could be implemented via auxiliary routines or macros that use library functions; inspect it to be certain no memcmp usage exists.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Used in an assertion; its definition must be checked in case it expands to expressions or helpers that use memcmp (rare but necessary to verify).\n\n- struct MemoryPool: The structure definition is required to confirm the types of its members (pool->memory, pool->is_mmap, pool->pos, pool->end, pool->size). In particular, if pool->memory were a char array or if there were inline functions operating on the structure that compare strings, those could use memcmp. Verify there are no hidden comparisons of null-terminated strings in members' accessors/inline helpers.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: This symbol (likely a variable or accessor) is used to decide whether to mmap. Its implementation or definition must be checked in case it invokes helper code that uses memcmp on strings.\n\nNote: Standard library functions used directly here (malloc, free, mmap, VirtualAlloc) and constants (MAP_FAILED, MAP_ANONYMOUS, etc.) are unlikely to call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings; they do not need detailed inspection for this specific MISRA rule. The above symbols are the ones that could reasonably hide memcmp usage via macros, inline helpers, or project-specific diagnostics and therefore must be examined."
