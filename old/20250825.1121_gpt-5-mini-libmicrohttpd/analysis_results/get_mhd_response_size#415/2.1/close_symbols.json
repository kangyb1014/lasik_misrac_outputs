  "explanation": "To determine whether any branch in get_mhd_response_size is unreachable, the analyzer must know whether the tested conditions can actually occur at runtime. Specifically:\n\n- tool_params: The function reads fields from this global; you must examine the actual variable to see its lifetime and linkage.\n- definition/typedef of the type of tool_params (struct tool_params): The member types (e.g. booleans, bitfields, enums, integers) can affect whether multiple members can be true simultaneously or whether some members are aliases/unreachable.\n- declarations of the members (tool_params.empty/tiny/medium/large): Knowing each member's type and semantics is required to decide if a branch can ever evaluate true or false.\n- all assignment sites that initialize or modify tool_params (especially in run_mhd and any startup/config/command-line parsing functions called before run_mhd): If those sites set these flags in a mutually exclusive manner (or never set some flags), certain else-if branches become unreachable. run_mhd is listed as the caller and likely sets up tool_params, so its code must be inspected; other initialization/config functions called before run_mhd must also be checked.\n- run_mhd: As the caller, it may initialize or enforce invariants on tool_params that make branches unreachable.\n- main: To locate program initialization order and callers that might set tool_params before run_mhd is invoked.\n- relevant macros / compile-time configuration that can force any of the above members to constant values: Preprocessor or build-time settings may make fields always true/false or remove code paths, producing unreachable branches.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer decide whether any of the return branches in get_mhd_response_size can never be taken (thus violating the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code)."
