The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "get_mhd_response_size does not contain any for-loops itself, but to determine conclusively whether it (or expressions used within it) could violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule you must inspect the symbols it reads: the tool_params object and the precise definitions/types of its members. Reasons:\n- tool_params: the function reads this global; you must see its declaration to know whether reading its members invokes any side effects (e.g. if access is via macros, functions, or overloaded operators in uncommon setups) or if it is a complex object whose access semantics are non-trivial.\n- type/definition of tool_params: to check whether the members are plain scalars (no side effects on read) or computed/aliasing fields, and to determine whether any macro/inline accessor is used instead of a plain member.\n- tool_params.empty / .tiny / .medium / .large: the MISRA rule restricts what objects may appear in for-loop clauses (loop counters, flags, objects modified in the body). Although this function contains no for, an analyzer must confirm these members are simple boolean/flag scalars and do not hide side effects or represent loop counters elsewhere. Knowing their types lets you confirm they are suitable as loop-control flags (if ever used in a for) and that reading them here does not modify program state.\n- Boolean type definition: if the members are of a boolean type, you must verify the exact type (stdbool.h bool or some typedef/enum/int) to reason about \"loop control flags\" per MISRA and confirm no unexpected semantics.\nNo other symbols (no called functions or local for-loops) are referenced by get_mhd_response_size, so no additional callees need inspection for MISRA for-loop well-formedness in this function."
