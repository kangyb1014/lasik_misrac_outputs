  "explanation": "- run_mhd (full definition): needed to see how get_mhd_response_size()'s return value is used \u2014 whether it is assigned to a non-const char * or passed to functions expecting a non-const pointer. MISRA rule assessment depends on actual uses in the caller.\n- tool_params (struct/type definition and the tool_params variable): required to confirm the types of the .empty/.tiny/.medium/.large fields and to ensure there are no macros/aliases that change semantics (and to confirm this function only returns string literals rather than pointers derived from non-const data).\n- print_perf_warnings (declaration/definition): include because run_mhd may pass the returned string to this function; we must check its parameter types (const qualification) to determine if returning const char * is compatible or if the caller forces a non-const usage.\n- MHD_start_daemon (declaration/prototype): MHD API functions are commonly called from run_mhd; if run_mhd passes the returned string to any MHD function, we must know the parameter const-qualification to evaluate compliance.\n- MHD_get_daemon_info (declaration/prototype): likewise, the prototype reveals whether it accepts const char * or char * for any string parameters that might receive the returned value.\n- MHD_stop_daemon (declaration/prototype): included for completeness if run_mhd forwards the returned pointer to any MHD call; its prototype must be checked for const qualification.\n\nIn short: we need the caller(s) and any callee prototypes that receive the returned string, plus the tool_params declaration, so we can determine if the returned const char * is used/converted to a non-const pointer (which would violate the MISRA guidance)."
