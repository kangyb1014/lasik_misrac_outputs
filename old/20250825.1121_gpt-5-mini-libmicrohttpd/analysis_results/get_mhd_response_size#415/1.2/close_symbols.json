  "explanation": "The function only reads members of the global symbol tool_params and returns string literals. To determine whether the code uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule about language extensions), the analyzer must see how tool_params and its members are declared/defined: \n- tool_params: needed to know whether it is a plain standard C object or declared with compiler-specific storage-class specifiers/attributes (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec) that are language extensions. \n- declaration/type definition of tool_params: required to detect use of non\u2011standard constructs in the type itself (anonymous/unnamed structs/unions, compiler extensions in the type, flexible/zero length arrays implemented via extensions, non\u2011standard bit\u2011field types or widths, nested function pointers with extension markers, etc.).\n- declarations of members empty, tiny, medium, large: required to check whether these members are ordinary standard C bit\u2011fields or booleans, or whether they are actually macros or map to extension constructs (e.g. bit\u2011field names colliding with macros, or members implemented via compiler extension features).\n- any macros/typedefs used inside the tool_params definition: these can hide language extensions (custom attribute macros, compiler builtin types, or non\u2011standard typedefs) and must be inspected.\n\nNo other external symbols from the function body (string literals, static/const, return type) are normally relevant to detecting language extensions; the only potential source of extensions is the definition/declaring context of tool_params and its members."
