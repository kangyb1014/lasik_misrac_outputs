  "explanation": "To decide whether get_mhd_response_size violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings we must not only inspect this function (which simply returns string literals) but also examine related symbols that could lead to a rule breach:\n\n- tool_params (definition/struct and declaration): Needed to know the types of the fields empty/tiny/medium/large. If these fields are pointers to strings (char *) rather than booleans, code elsewhere might be comparing them with memcmp, which is the MISRA concern. If they are booleans, that reduces the surface for string comparisons.\n\n- all functions that assign to tool_params.empty / tool_params.tiny / tool_params.medium / tool_params.large: We must inspect how these fields get set (e.g., via parsing code or initialization). Those functions may perform string comparisons using memcmp (or wrap memcmp), producing a MISRA violation that affects how the flags are derived.\n\n- run_mhd (caller of get_mhd_response_size): As the direct caller, run_mhd might compare or further process the returned strings (or the flags) using memcmp; we must inspect it to see if any memcmp-based string comparisons occur in the caller chain.\n\n- main (caller of run_mhd and possible initializer of tool_params): main (or other top-level init code) may perform option parsing or comparisons that use memcmp; include it to trace origin of any string comparisons that affect the values used in get_mhd_response_size.\n\n- all call sites of memcmp in the codebase (and the source files/lines): The MISRA rule targets memcmp usage. You must find every use of memcmp to check whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (e.g., comparing char * or string literals). This is the direct evidence of a rule violation.\n\n- memcmp (declaration/headers) and any wrappers around memcmp used in the project: Inspecting declarations and wrappers reveals intended use (e.g., wrappers that handle length properly or are documented to avoid use for null-terminated strings) and whether the project uses memcmp directly or via helpers.\n\n- all call sites that compare the strings returned by get_mhd_response_size: Even if get_mhd_response_size itself does not call memcmp, callers might compare its return value against other strings using memcmp. Those comparisons would be the direct MISRA-relevant code paths and must be inspected.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and call sites) allows a complete analysis to decide whether the project uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings in ways that relate to or affect get_mhd_response_size."
