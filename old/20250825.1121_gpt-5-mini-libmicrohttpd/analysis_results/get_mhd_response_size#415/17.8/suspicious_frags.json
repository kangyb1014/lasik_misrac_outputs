  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: get_mhd_response_size has no formal parameters (signature takes void), so Rule 17.8 (modifying function parameters) cannot be violated in that function. The function only reads fields of the global object tool_params and returns string literals; there are no assignments to any function parameters. The provided static initialization of tool_params is an object initializer (not a function parameter modification). Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
