  "explanation": "The MISRA rule concerns whether the controlling expressions (the member accesses used in the if/else-if chain) are invariant. To decide that you must know whether those members are compile-time constants, never-modified globals, or can change at runtime. \u2022 tool_params: the global variable itself \u2014 needed to see its linkage and whether it is declared const/volatile or otherwise constrained. \u2022 tool_params.empty / .tiny / .medium / .large: each member used as a controlling expression \u2014 you must know their declared types (boolean/int/enum/bitfield), qualifiers, and whether they are macros or replaced by constants. \u2022 type/definition of the variable tool_params (struct tag and member declarations, including const/volatile qualifiers): to determine if the members are constant, volatile, or bitfields and whether their values can legally change at runtime. \u2022 all functions/translation-unit symbols that initialize or assign to any tool_params members (e.g. option-parsing, initialization or config routines): to prove whether the members can be modified after compile/link time (making the controlling expressions non\u2011invariant) or are never written (which would make them effectively invariant). These symbols allow checking both declaration-level invariance (const/compile-time) and run-time mutability (assignment sites), which are both relevant to the MISRA constraint."
