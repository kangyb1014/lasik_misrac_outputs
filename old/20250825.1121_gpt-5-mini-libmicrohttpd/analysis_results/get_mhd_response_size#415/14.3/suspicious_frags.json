  "explanation": "Only the conditional controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant). The remaining code (function signature, return statements, and the static initialization of the tool_params object) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not directly subject to Rule 14.3. The static initializer of tool_params uses ordinary integer constants but the object is not declared const; whether the conditionals are effectively invariant depends on whether those fields can be modified elsewhere, which is what the investigators should determine. No other fragments in the function act as loop or conditional controlling expressions and thus do not need investigation under this rule."
