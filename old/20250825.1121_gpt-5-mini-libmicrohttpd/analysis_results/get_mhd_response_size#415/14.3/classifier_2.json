  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: tool_params.tiny is a member of a non-const static structure and therefore not an invariant controlling expression. The value may be modified elsewhere at runtime, so the controlling expression is not compile-time invariant. (A violation would occur if the controlling expression were a compile-time constant, e.g. if tool_params were declared const or the test used a literal/constant macro that cannot change.)"
