Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required to determine whether any branch in get_mhd_response_size constitutes dead code:\n\n- tool_params\n  Reason: This global object is the decision point for all branches. You must inspect its declaration, linkage, and lifetime to know whether the members tested in get_mhd_response_size can ever change or be observed at runtime.\n\n- tool_params.empty, tool_params.tiny, tool_params.medium, tool_params.large\n  Reason: Each branch is guarded by one of these members. To determine if a return branch is dead you need to know whether the corresponding member can ever be true/false at the point get_mhd_response_size is executed (including mutual exclusivity or invariants among them).\n\n- definition/type of tool_params (struct/typedef)\n  Reason: The member types (e.g. bool, bitfield, int), default initializers, and any constraints encoded in the type affect reachability. For example, bitfields or enums could restrict values; static initialization in the type may make some members constant.\n\n- all assignment sites that modify tool_params (functions or files that write its members)\n  Reason: Any code that sets these members (initializers, command-line parsing, configuration loaders, test harnesses, or other functions) determines the runtime values and whether branches are reachable. You must inspect every write to these members to decide if some branches are never taken.\n\n- run_mhd\n  Reason: run_mhd is the caller of get_mhd_response_size (per the call graph). You need to inspect how run_mhd invokes get_mhd_response_size and how/when tool_params is set relative to that call to determine if particular branches are ever exercised.\n\n- main\n  Reason: main calls run_mhd and may perform early initialization or parsing that sets tool_params (e.g., command-line options). Examining main and its initialization path is necessary to determine if certain branches are unreachable or redundant in normal program operation.\n\n- preprocessor macros that affect tool_params or control compilation of these branches\n  Reason: Compile-time macros can make flags effectively constant (e.g., forcing a particular mode) or remove code via conditional compilation; such macros can make some branches dead across the whole build. You must check relevant #defines or build-time configuration that could render branches impossible.\n\nNotes on what to look for in these symbols to decide MISRA dead-code: check whether any branch condition is provably impossible given all initializations, assignments, and build-time macros; verify if removing a branch alters program behaviour (observable outputs/timing); and ensure you distinguish unreachable code (never executed) from dead code (executed but removable without effect) by examining side effects and call sites."
