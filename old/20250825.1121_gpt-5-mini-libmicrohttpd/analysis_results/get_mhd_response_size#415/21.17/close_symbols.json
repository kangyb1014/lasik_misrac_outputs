  "explanation": "To determine MISRA C string-bounds violations you must confirm that get_mhd_response_size does not (directly or indirectly) use any <string.h> functions or return pointers into non-static buffers. The function itself returns string literals (which are static), so the main potential issue would be how the decision fields are declared and accessed:\n\n- tool_params (global variable): needed to see whether this is actually a simple struct instance, a pointer, or something with side effects. If tool_params were a pointer to a buffer or implemented via accessor macros/functions, reads could have unexpected behavior or indirect string accesses.\n\n- Type/struct definition of tool_params (members empty,tiny,medium,large): you must verify each named member is a simple scalar flag (not an array, not a pointer to a string, not a macro that expands to a function call). If any member is, for example, a macro that invokes string operations or aliases into buffers, that could implicate string.h usage or out-of-bounds access.\n\n- Definition of the scalar/boolean type used for those members (e.g., bool or int / <stdbool.h> typedef): needed to ensure the member types are indeed plain scalars and not custom types with overloaded semantics (macros, inline functions) that might perform string operations.\n\nNo other symbols are required because get_mhd_response_size has no callees and the returned values in the source are string literals (constant static storage) which do not violate the cited rule by themselves."
