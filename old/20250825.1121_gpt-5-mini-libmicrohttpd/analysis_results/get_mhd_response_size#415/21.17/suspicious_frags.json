  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, memmove, memset, memcmp, strspn, etc.) is present in this function. The function only returns pointers to string literals (static storage), so there is no risk of out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses via string handling functions or returning pointers to local/automatic buffers. There is no buffer manipulation, no pointer arithmetic on character arrays, and no calls that take pointer parameters to character objects. Therefore no fragments in this code need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
