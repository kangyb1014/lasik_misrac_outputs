The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking compliance with the MISRA for\u2011loop rule we must inspect any functions called by the target (their behaviour is considered part of any loop body) and any conditional compilation symbols that change which code is present. Brief rationale for each symbol:\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: This callee's implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not contain or modify any loop counters or objects used in loop clauses (called functions contribute to the behaviour of a for body).\n- MHD_NO: Macro/constant used in the conditional that determines whether MHD_is_feature_supported result triggers code; needed to evaluate the conditional path and whether the call occurs.\n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: Identifies the feature queried; needed to understand the semantics of the MHD_is_feature_supported call and any side effects related to that feature.\n- fprintf: Standard I/O function called from this function \u2014 its side effects (including any global state changes) should be considered if this function were to appear inside a for loop; verify it does not modify loop counters or objects used in loop clauses.\n- printf: Same reason as fprintf: it is called conditionally and any side effects must be known when assessing loop behaviour.\n- _DEBUG: Preprocessor symbol controlling whether the debug-assert warning (and associated code) is present; affects which statements exist in the compiled function.\n- __GNUC__: Preprocessor symbol used to enable/disable code paths; necessary to know which code lines (and calls) exist.\n- __OPTIMIZE__: Controls inclusion of optimisation-related warning; affects whether calls/statements are present.\n- __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: Controls inclusion of size-optimisation warning; affects which statements exist.\n- MHD_VERSION: Controls compilation of the block that calls MHD_is_feature_supported; required to know whether that block (and the call) is present.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine which code is actually present in the compiled print_perf_warnings function and to inspect the behaviour of any called functions so you can conclude whether any for loops (in this function or in callees invoked in loop bodies) violate the MISRA for\u2011loop requirements."
