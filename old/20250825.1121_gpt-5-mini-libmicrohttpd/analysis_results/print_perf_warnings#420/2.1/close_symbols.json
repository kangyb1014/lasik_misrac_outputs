  "explanation": "To determine whether any blocks in print_perf_warnings are unreachable under all build/ runtime conditions you must know which conditional-compilation branches and runtime checks can actually be present or true:\n\n- _DEBUG: Controls the first #if block. If always undefined/defined in the project build, the fprintf and the newline assignment inside that block are either present or absent; needed to decide compile-time reachability.\n\n- __GNUC__: Used in multiple #if checks combining with __OPTIMIZE__ and __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__. Knowing whether the compiler defines this macro decides which optimisation-related warning blocks are compiled in.\n\n- __OPTIMIZE__: Its presence/absence (often set by compiler flags) determines the second #if (\"! defined (__OPTIMIZE__)\") and thus whether that warning block is compiled.\n\n- __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: Controls the third #if. Knowing whether this macro is defined decides if the size-optimisation warning block exists.\n\n- MHD_VERSION: The numeric value of this macro decides whether the MHD-specific block (guarded by #if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701) is compiled at all. If the block is excluded at compile time, the contained code cannot be reached.\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: This runtime function is called inside the MHD_VERSION-guarded block. To decide whether the inner fprintf/newline assignment is unreachable at runtime you must know the semantics and possible return values of this function (i.e. whether it can ever return a value different from MHD_NO).\n\n- MHD_NO: The code compares MHD_is_feature_supported(...) to MHD_NO. The numeric value/meaning of MHD_NO and whether MHD_is_feature_supported may return values other than MHD_NO is required to determine if the if-condition can ever be true (affecting reachability of that inner block).\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: The specific feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported; needed because the behaviour of MHD_is_feature_supported depends on which feature is queried.\n\n(Other symbols such as fprintf/printf are standard I/O functions and do not affect compile-time reachability \u2014 only the macros and the MHD feature API/values above can render code permanently unreachable.)"
