  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required to decide if any controlling expression is invariant:\n\n- _DEBUG\n  - Controls compilation of the first #if block that sets newline_needed (via newline_needed |= !0). If _DEBUG is defined the assignment executes at runtime and can make the later controlling expression (if (newline_needed)) non\u2011zero. If not defined that source of mutation is absent.\n\n- __GNUC__\n  - Used in the #if conditions that enable other assignments to newline_needed (and the MHD-related block eligibility together with other macros). Whether these blocks are compiled affects whether newline_needed can change, so the presence/absence of __GNUC__ matters for invariance.\n\n- __OPTIMIZE__\n  - Tested (negated) in combination with __GNUC__ to include a block that sets newline_needed. Its definition (or not) determines whether that runtime write exists, affecting whether newline_needed (and thus the controlling expression if (newline_needed)) is invariant.\n\n- __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__\n  - Tested in another #if that emits a fprintf (no assignment to newline_needed in this snippet, but it participates in the same family of compile\u2011time config checks). Its status can change which warnings/assignments are present; include to be conservative when deciding invariance.\n\n- MHD_VERSION\n  - Preprocessor test #if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 governs whether the MHD_is_feature_supported call and its potential assignment to newline_needed are compiled in. The numeric value of MHD_VERSION at compile time decides whether that runtime test exists.\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported\n  - This is the runtime call used in the controlling if expression inside the MHD_VERSION block (if (MHD_NO != MHD_is_feature_supported(...))). You must know whether this is a function (and can return run\u2011time varying values) or a macro/constant and what values it can produce to determine if the controlling expression is invariant.\n\n- MHD_NO\n  - The value/definition used in the comparison with MHD_is_feature_supported's result. If MHD_NO equals the call result always (or the call is a compile\u2011time constant), the controlling expression could be invariant; thus its definition/value is needed.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD\n  - The feature argument passed to MHD_is_feature_supported; its definition/value may affect whether the call is a constant/macro or how the function evaluates, and is needed to reason about possible runtime variation of the comparison.\n\nNote: Standard library functions fprintf/printf and the local variable newline_needed are not required as symbols for determining invariance (their behavior does not change whether a controlling expression is constant). The primary concern is which compile\u2011time blocks are present and whether the MHD_is_feature_supported comparison can vary at run time, so the listed macros/constants and the definition/semantics of MHD_is_feature_supported are necessary to conclude compliance with the MISRA rule."
