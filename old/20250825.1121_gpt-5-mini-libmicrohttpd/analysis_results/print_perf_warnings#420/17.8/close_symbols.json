  "explanation": "- _DEBUG, __GNUC__, __OPTIMIZE__, __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: These preprocessor macros control which blocks of code are compiled into print_perf_warnings. To decide whether any compiled branch could modify a function parameter (or expand into code that does), the exact definitions/values of these macros at build time must be known.\\n- MHD_VERSION: Controls whether the MHD-related conditional block is present; its value determines whether the call to MHD_is_feature_supported and its associated code are compiled.\\n- MHD_NO, MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: Symbols used in the MHD conditional and in the call to MHD_is_feature_supported; their definitions (or enum values/macros) are needed to understand the semantics of the check and whether any macro expansion could introduce parameter modification.\\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: The declaration or macro definition is required to confirm its parameter list and whether it is a macro that could expand to code that modifies (directly or indirectly) the parameters of print_perf_warnings. Even though print_perf_warnings has no parameters, a macro expansion could inject code that touches parameters or otherwise violates MISRA rules.\\n- fprintf, printf, stderr: Declarations or macro definitions for the standard I/O symbols are needed to ensure they are not redefined as macros that expand into code that might modify parameters of the current function.\\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule concerns modification of a function's own parameters. print_perf_warnings has no formal parameters, so a direct violation is unlikely; however, preprocessor macros or called routines could be macros or inline expansions that introduce code modifying parameters (or redefine the function signature). The listed symbols are precisely those whose definitions/declared signatures determine which code is actually compiled into print_perf_warnings and whether any hidden/expanded code could violate the MISRA parameter-modification rule."
