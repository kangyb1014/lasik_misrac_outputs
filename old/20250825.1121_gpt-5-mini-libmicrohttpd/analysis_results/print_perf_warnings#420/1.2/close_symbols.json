  "explanation": "To determine whether print_perf_warnings uses language/compiler extensions you must know which conditional macros and external symbols are in effect and whether they are compiler-specific extensions: \n- __GNUC__: predefined by GCC; presence/usage is a compiler-specific macro (extension) \u2014 needed to decide if the code is relying on a GCC extension. \n- __OPTIMIZE__: GCC-specific predefined macro controlling optimizations; used in preprocessor conditionals in this function. \n- __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: GCC-specific predefined macro for size-optimizations; used in preprocessor conditionals. \n- _DEBUG: project/compiler debug macro used in preprocessor conditional \u2014 needed to know whether the code path relying on a nonstandard debug assertion macro is enabled. \n- MHD_VERSION: library version macro used in a conditional; may be defined by libmicrohttpd and could encode nonstandard behavior\u2014needed to evaluate that conditional and whether it relies on library-specific extensions. \n- MHD_is_feature_supported: external library function called inside conditionals; its presence/semantics determine whether an implementation-specific feature check (possibly nonstandard) is used. \n- MHD_NO: library constant compared against the return of MHD_is_feature_supported; required to interpret that conditional and whether it uses nonstandard values. \n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: library feature identifier macro/enum passed to MHD_is_feature_supported; required to know if this is a library-specific extension. \n- fprintf, printf, stderr: stdio I/O symbols used for diagnostics; included so the analyzer can confirm these are standard C library usages (not compiler extensions) and not some macro or extension-overridden symbols. \nThese symbols collectively allow the next analyzer to determine whether any conditional compilation or calls rely on compiler- or implementation-specific extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
