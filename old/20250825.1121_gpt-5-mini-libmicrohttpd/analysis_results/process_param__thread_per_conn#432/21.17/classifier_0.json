  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The code fragment calls fprintf with a \"%s\" conversion, not any of the functions from <string.h> listed in Rule 21.17. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated. (Note: if param_name were NULL or not NUL-terminated, fprintf(\"%s\") could read out of bounds at runtime or crash \u2014 that is a separate runtime/validation issue, but it is not a direct violation of Rule 21.17 which specifically targets <string.h> functions.)"
