  "explanation": "The only potential out-of-bounds string accesses in this function are the two uses of param_name as a %s argument to fprintf (which expect a non-NULL, null-terminated character array) and the indexed access param_name[1]. These locations can read past the bounds of the object referenced by param_name if param_name is NULL or shorter than two characters. There are no calls to <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) elsewhere in this function, nor any other array or pointer indexing operations that could lead to similar violations, so no other fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 within this function."
