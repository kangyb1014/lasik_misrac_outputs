  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found regarding MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is declared as 'const char *param_name' and is only read (used in fprintf and indexed as param_name[1]); there is no assignment to param_name itself (no reassignments like 'param_name = ...') and no attempt to modify the object pointed to (the pointee is const). Other assignments in the function (e.g., tool_params.thread_per_conn = !0) modify global state, not the function parameter, so they are outside the scope of Rule 17.8 and do not need investigation for this rule."
