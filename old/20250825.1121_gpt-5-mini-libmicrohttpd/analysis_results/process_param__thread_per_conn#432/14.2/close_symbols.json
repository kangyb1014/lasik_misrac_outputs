The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each required symbol (why needed to judge MISRA 'for' well\u2011formedness for this function):\n\n- tool_params: Need the definition (type, whether it's a struct, union, or macro) to determine if reads/writes of its members are simple object accesses or expand to calls/macros that may contain for loops or other side effects. MISRA forbids loop counters or objects modified in the body to be used improperly \u2014 hidden side effects matter.\n\n- tool_params.all_cpus: The code reads this member in a conditional. If all_cpus is a macro or accessor function, it could hide a for loop or persistent side effects; confirm it is a plain boolean/flag object access.\n\n- tool_params.threads: Same reason as all_cpus \u2014 the conditional compares this member; ensure it is not a macro/function with side effects or containing a for loop.\n\n- tool_params.thread_per_conn: The code assigns to this member. We must confirm the assignment is a simple store (no macro/function expansion, no hidden loop or other side effects) and that its type is suitable (not an object that could serve as a loop counter or be modified elsewhere unexpectedly).\n\n- any macros expanding to accessors/assignments of tool_params.*: Capture any macro definitions that the above member accesses might expand to (e.g., GET_THREAD_PER_CONN(), SET_... macros). Such macros could contain code (including for loops) that affect compliance.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result: Need the enum/type definition to know whether the return expressions are plain constants or macros/expressions that might invoke code with loops.\n\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: Verify these identifiers are simple enum constants (or simple integer macros). If any are macros expanding to function calls or expressions containing for loops, that could affect rule analysis.\n\n- fprintf: The function is called in this function. Although there is no for loop in this function, if fprintf is a macro wrapper in this codebase (or replaced by a function-like macro) it could hide loops \u2014 confirm it is the standard library function (no hidden loop body affecting analysis).\n\n- stderr: Similarly, confirm stderr is the usual FILE* object and not a macro that expands to code with loops.\n\nNotes: The target function contains no for loops itself. The main risk for violating the MISRA 'for' well\u2011formedness rule would be hidden for loops or side effects inside macros/functions used in expressions or assignments in this function. The listed symbols let an analyst confirm that all member accesses, assignments, returns and calls are simple and do not hide for loops or forbidden side effects."
