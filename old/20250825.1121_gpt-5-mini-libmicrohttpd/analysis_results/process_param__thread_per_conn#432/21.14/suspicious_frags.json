  "explanation": "No use of the standard library function memcmp appears in the provided function or related snippets. The code performs a direct character comparison (param_name[1] == '-') and does not call memcmp (nor strcmp/strncmp) to compare null-terminated strings. The tool_params initialization contains only integer/flag initializers and no library calls. Therefore there are no code fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 to report. If memcmp is used elsewhere in the project (not shown), those locations should be inspected, but they are not present in the supplied code."
