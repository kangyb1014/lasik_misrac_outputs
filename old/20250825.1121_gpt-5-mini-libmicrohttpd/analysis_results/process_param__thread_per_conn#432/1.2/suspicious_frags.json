  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in this snippet. The code uses only standard C constructs: static storage, enum return type, const char* parameter, fprintf, logical/ternary operators and character literals. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__/asm, __builtin_ functions, typeof, __declspec, inline assembly, or other compiler-specific keywords/pragmas documented as extensions. The double underscore in the function name is an identifier naming choice (reserved by the implementation) but is not a language extension. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
