  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not involve passing or assigning pointers to non-const-qualified types that might be derived from const-qualified sources or casting away const. Specifically: the function parameter declarations show 'data' already const-qualified (so the declaration itself is compliant), the 'ctx' parameter is non-const for legitimate modification of the context, pointer arithmetic on 'data' (data += ...) does not change the pointee qualification, the count/bytes arithmetic involves non-pointer scalar types, and the control-flow checks (mhd_assert, length checks, early return, loop headers) do not affect pointer constness. The four listed fragments are the places where pointers and casts are used in a way that could discard or remove const-qualification and therefore require further inspection."
