The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- struct Md5Ctx: The function accesses ctx->count, ctx->buffer and ctx->H. The definition (types, possible macros or inline functions used in member declarations) is required to check whether any of those accesses expand to or call code containing a for loop or modify potential loop counters (e.g. if a member is a macro or has accessor that contains a for).\n\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE: This macro controls loop boundaries (bytes_have calculation and while condition). If MD5_BLOCK_SIZE is defined via a macro that expands to an expression containing side effects or if its value changes analysis of loop conditions, it must be known to determine whether any for loop-like constructs are introduced or affected.\n\n- mhd_assert: Could be a macro that expands into statements (possibly including loops). To be certain the function body contains no for loops (or to know whether the macro introduces one), the definition of mhd_assert must be examined.\n\n- memcpy: In some builds memcpy may be a macro/inline implementation (or macro wrapper) that could contain for loops; examine its definition to ensure it does not inject a for loop into this function body or otherwise modify loop counters used by a for loop.\n\n- md5_transform: It is called from this function. Although the target function contains no for statements, MISRA requires that the behaviour of a for loop body includes behaviour of called functions. If a for loop is introduced (e.g. via macros above) or if the analysis wants to be conservative, md5_transform must be inspected for any for loops that could interact with loop counters or violate the well-formedness rules.\n\n- __builtin_rotateleft32: This is a direct callee of md5_transform. If md5_transform contains for loops that call or rely on this builtin, its behaviour may matter to a complete analysis of for-loop bodies in the call chain.\n\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: This conditional compilation macro changes control flow (skips the early return). Its definition controls which code is actually compiled; different configurations could expose different control structures. To be certain there are no for loops in the compiled target, the macro configuration must be known.\n\nNote: The target function as shown does not contain any for statements. The above symbols are those that could (a) expand into for loops through macros/inline implementations, or (b) are callees whose internals must be inspected if a for loop were present in this function (or introduced by macros). Examining these symbols is sufficient to determine whether any for-loop-related MISRA violations could arise in the compiled function."
