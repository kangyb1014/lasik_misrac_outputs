  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Specific control constructs and why they need not be investigated:\n\n- mhd_assert ((data != NULL) || (length == 0)): This is an assertion macro, not a loop controlling expression, and its expression depends on the parameter 'length' and 'data'.\n\n- #ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE / if (0 == length) return;: The condition depends on the parameter 'length' and is not a compile-time constant (it can be true or false at runtime). This is not an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- if (0 != bytes_have): bytes_have is computed from ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1) just above and may be non-zero depending on the context; it is not a constant invariant. Moreover bytes_have is modified inside the branch.\n\n- if (length >= bytes_left): Both operands are runtime values (length and bytes_left), and length is modified in subsequent code. The controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- while (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length): This loop condition depends on 'length', which is decremented inside the loop (length -= MD5_BLOCK_SIZE), so the condition is not invariant. This is not an infinite-constant controlling expression.\n\n- if (0 != length): The condition depends on the runtime value of 'length' and is not an invariant.\n\nNo do-while with a constant false controlling expression or intentionally infinite constant loop patterns are present, and no controlling expression here is a compile-time invariant. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
