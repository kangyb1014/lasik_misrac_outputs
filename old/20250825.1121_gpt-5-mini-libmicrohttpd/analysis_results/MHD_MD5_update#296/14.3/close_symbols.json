  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking MISRA C rule on invariant controlling expressions:\n\n- struct Md5Ctx (full definition: types of fields count, buffer and H)\n  - The function computes bytes_have from ctx->count and updates ctx->count. The exact type and width of count (e.g., uint32_t/uint64_t/signedness) determine whether arithmetic and bitwise operations (ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE-1)) and the increment ctx->count += length can wrap or change the value seen by subsequent conditionals. Also the definitions of buffer and H confirm whether called functions could alias or modify count via side effects.\n\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE (macro value)\n  - The controlling expressions use MD5_BLOCK_SIZE (e.g., MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length, MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have). Whether a conditional can be constant depends on the numeric value of this macro and its relation to length and count.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function definition)\n  - The assert expression ((data != NULL) || (length == 0)) is a controlling expression. To decide if it can be invariant (always true/false) the analyzer needs the semantics of mhd_assert (does it compile out in non-debug builds, does it evaluate its argument unconditionally) and any side effects it may have.\n\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE (preprocessor macro)\n  - The presence or absence of the early-return if (0 == length) depends on this macro. Whether that controlling expression is exercised at runtime (and thus whether invariant checks apply) depends on build configuration; the analyzer must know if the macro is defined.\n\n- md5_transform (function definition)\n  - md5_transform is called inside branches and the loop. To determine whether controlling expressions are invariant across calls we must know whether md5_transform can modify any of the variables used in the controlling expressions (notably ctx->count, ctx->buffer, length, or global state that affects subsequent conditions). If md5_transform can change those, conditions that appear invariant locally may actually vary.\n\n- memcpy (declaration/semantics)\n  - memcpy is used to copy into ctx->buffer. While it normally does not modify length or count, the analyzer should know its semantics (no side effects on length/count, no undefined behaviour for given arguments) to rule out that a controlling expression is invariant due to unexpected side effects.\n\n- uint8_t (typedef)\n  - Knowing the exact typedef confirms width/signedness assumptions for pointer arithmetic and casts used in memcpy and pointer adjustments; while not typically the source of invariant controls, it is part of understanding expression evaluation semantics.\n\n- size_t (typedef)\n  - length is size_t; its width and unsignedness affect comparisons (e.g., MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length) and arithmetic (length -= bytes_left, length -= MD5_BLOCK_SIZE). The analyzer needs these type properties to determine if a controlling expression can be statically constant (e.g., due to underflow/wrap or if size_t has constrained range)."
