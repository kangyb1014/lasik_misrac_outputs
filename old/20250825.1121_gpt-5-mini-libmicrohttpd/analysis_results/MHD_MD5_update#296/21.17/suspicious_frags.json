  "explanation": "Only uses of the <string.h> function memcpy and the code that computes or updates the pointer/length arguments supplied to those memcpy calls can cause accesses beyond object bounds per MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The fragments above include both memcpy calls and all nearby statements that affect the buffer offset and source pointer/length (the assert that constrains data/length, the computation of bytes_have, update of ctx->count, computation of bytes_left, the branch that consumes bytes_left, the adjustments to data and length, and the loop that consumes full blocks). These are the elements that must be investigated together to ensure the memcpy invocations cannot access beyond the bounds of ctx->buffer or the source data. Other parts of the function (comments, declarations, the early return when length==0, the md5_transform implementation itself, casts that do not alter values, and control-structure syntax) do not directly call or affect the arguments of standard string.h functions and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.17 compliance in this context."
