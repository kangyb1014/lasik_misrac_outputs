If mhd_assert is a no-op (e.g. in release builds) a caller could pass data == NULL with length > 0 and later memcpy calls (the one copying bytes_left and the final memcpy copying length bytes) will dereference data and access beyond bounds. Thus the single assertion is insufficient to guarantee no out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses to the pointer parameters of the <string.h> functions.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The only check that data is non-NULL when length>0 is performed via mhd_assert ((data != NULL) || (length == 0)). If that macro is compiled out (as is common for assert-like macros in release builds), there is no runtime guarantee that data is valid when length>0. Subsequent calls to memcpy (and the md5_transform calls that read from data) will then dereference data and can access memory beyond the bounds of the object referenced by the data pointer (or dereference a NULL pointer). That is exactly what MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids. To comply, the code must perform an unconditional runtime check (or otherwise ensure by contract/enforcement that data is non-NULL when length>0) before calling memcpy or other string/memory functions."
