  "scenario": "No violation. The expression computes the number of remaining bytes to fill the MD5 block and does not itself call any <string.h> function. In this implementation bytes_have is derived as (unsigned int)(ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1)), so 0 <= bytes_have < MD5_BLOCK_SIZE and bytes_left = MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have yields a small, correct value that is guarded by the subsequent if (length >= bytes_left) before memcpy. A violation could occur only if bytes_have were allowed to be >= MD5_BLOCK_SIZE (e.g. incorrect masking, MD5_BLOCK_SIZE == 0, or an unrelated corruption), causing an unsigned underflow and a very large bytes_left that could be passed to memcpy and lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds access\u2014but that scenario is not present in the shown code.
