  "explanation": "All pointer usages in the function have been reviewed:\n- const char *str: already const-qualified; it is only read (indexed) and not modified, so it complies with Rule 8.13.\n- uint64_t *out_val: this pointer is used to return an output value (assigned via *out_val = res), so it must not be a pointer-to-const. Declaring it const would prevent the intended assignment; therefore it is not feasible to add const here.\nThere are no other pointer types or pointer parameters in the function. No pointer could be further const-qualified without breaking intended behavior, so there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
