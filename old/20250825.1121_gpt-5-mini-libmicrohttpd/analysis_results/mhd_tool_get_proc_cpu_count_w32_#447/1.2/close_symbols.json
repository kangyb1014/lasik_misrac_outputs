  "explanation": "For determining whether the function uses compiler language extensions you must inspect the Windows API types, calling\u2011convention macros and the GetProcAddress cast usage. Explanations by symbol: \n\n- WINAPI\n  - Expands to a calling\u2011convention keyword (e.g. __stdcall on MSVC). Those calling\u2011convention keywords are compiler extensions in many compilers; you must know the exact expansion to decide if an extension is used.\n\n- BOOL\n  - Windows typedef that may be a macro/typedef; its definition helps check for use of non\u2011standard boolean types versus standard C types.\n\n- bool\n  - The code uses the C99 bool/true/false identifiers. You must know whether the project/compiler treats 'bool' as standard _Bool or as a compiler extension (MSVC historically provided 'bool' as an extension).\n\n- FARPROC and GetProcAddress\n  - GetProcAddress\u2019s return type and FARPROC definitions determine whether the code\u2019s cast (GPGA_PTR) (void *) GetProcAddress(...) is converting between data and function pointers. Conversion between object and function pointers is implementation\u2011defined and some compilers require extensions; you must inspect GetProcAddress/FARPROC to judge if the cast relies on an extension.\n\n- WINAPI/FARPROC together\n  - Function pointer typedefs in the code use WINAPI; you must know both FARPROC and WINAPI expansions to evaluate whether the function\u2011pointer declarations use compiler\u2011specific calling conventions (an extension).\n\n- GetProcessAffinityMask, GetCurrentProcess, GetCurrentThread\n  - Signatures show parameter types (e.g. DWORD_PTR*) and whether special pointer types or attributes are involved; also needed to confirm whether Windows API usage forces casts that rely on extensions.\n\n- LoadLibraryA, GetProcAddress, FreeLibrary\n  - These are used with explicit casts to function pointers and HMODULE \u2014 their prototypes and return types are necessary to confirm whether the code performs illegal/implementation\u2011defined pointer conversions or uses non\u2011standard extensions.\n\n- GetProcessGroupAffinity, GetProcessDefaultCpuSetMasks\n  - These API names are resolved via GetProcAddress and the code builds function pointer typedefs matching their expected signatures. Their official signatures and types are required to check whether the typedefs use calling conventions or types that are compiler extensions.\n\n- HANDLE, HMODULE, DWORD_PTR, PUSHORT, USHORT, WORD, KAFFINITY\n  - These Windows typedefs/macros define underlying types (pointers, integer widths). You need their definitions to determine whether non\u2011standard integer/width types or compiler attributes (e.g. __int64, __w64) are used that would constitute language extensions.\n\n- GetCurrentThread\n  - Present in disabled code but referenced; its signature would be relevant if the disabled code were conditionally compiled in some builds \u2014 include to be safe when checking for extensions in alternate build configurations.\n\nIn short: inspect the Windows API function prototypes, the typedefs for the Windows types, the WINAPI/FARPROC expansions, and the use of 'bool' to decide if any compiler\u2011documented language extensions are used (calling\u2011convention keywords, non\u2011standard boolean support, pointer\u2011type conversion behaviors)."
