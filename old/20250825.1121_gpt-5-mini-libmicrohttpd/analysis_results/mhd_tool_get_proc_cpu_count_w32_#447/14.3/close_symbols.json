  "explanation": "For deciding whether any controlling expressions in mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_ are invariant (MISRA: \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\"), the analyzer must know which tests are genuinely constant and which depend on external/runtime information. Each listed symbol can affect the value of a controlling expression or whether a branch is reachable, so they are required for a sound determination:\n\n- _WIN32 / __CYGWIN__: Determine whether the whole Windows-specific block is compiled in. If the block is excluded at preprocessing, many controlling expressions do not exist in the compiled unit.\n\n- MHDT_MAX_GROUP_COUNT: Initial value used to set arr_elements and array sizes; it affects whether comparisons like (1 == arr_elements) might be invariant if arr_elements never changes.\n\n- GetProcessAffinityMask: Supplies proc_aff/sys_aff used in the for-loop controlling expression (0 != proc_aff). The runtime behavior of this API decides whether that loop condition is invariant or dependent on external state.\n\n- GetCurrentProcess: Passed to several APIs (GetProcessAffinityMask, GetProcessGroupAffinity, GetProcessDefaultCpuSetMasks). The value passed can influence API results; the existence/semantics of this symbol link these calls to process-specific state rather than being compile-time constants.\n\n- DWORD_PTR: Type of proc_aff/sys_aff; knowing its width/representation is useful to reason about the for-loop termination condition and bit-manipulation (proc_aff &= proc_aff - 1).\n\n- LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress: Determine whether subsequent function-pointer checks (ptrGetProcessGroupAffinity == NULL, ptrGetProcessDefaultCpuSetMasks == NULL) are constant or depend on runtime lookup of kernel32 exports. If GetProcAddress can return NULL at runtime, those if-tests are not invariant.\n\n- GetProcessGroupAffinity: When present and invoked it writes arr_elements (group count) and affects the (1 == arr_elements) test. Its runtime semantics decide whether that equality is invariant.\n\n- GetProcessDefaultCpuSetMasks: Its presence and return value set win_fe_or_later and cpu_set_mask_assigned, which govern several later conditionals (e.g., if (! win_fe_or_later), if (cpu_set_mask_assigned)). These tests are not compile-time constants if this API can return different results.\n\n- USHORT: Type of arr_elements/num_elm; knowing its range helps judge whether comparisons (1 == arr_elements) can be statically constant.\n\n- struct mhdt_GR_AFFINITY, KAFFINITY, WORD: Types used by GetProcessDefaultCpuSetMasks and related data structures; they affect how many elements are possible and whether functions can modify state used in controlling expressions.\n\n- FreeLibrary: While it does not affect a controlling expression directly, its presence indicates dynamic loading/unloading control flow; the use of LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress/FreeLibrary as a trio is essential to decide whether the ptrGet* function-pointer NULL checks are compile-time invariants.\n\nIn practice, the only obvious literal invariant in the source is the explicit if (1). To conclude whether that or any other conditional is a MISRA violation you must know whether that if (1) was intended as a scoping device or compiled-out pattern (preprocessor context) and whether the other conditionals genuinely depend on runtime results from the listed APIs/types. The symbols above provide the necessary external context to make that determination."
