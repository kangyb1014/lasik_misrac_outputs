  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Input:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Input (struct SHA1Context *context, const unsigned char *message_array,\n           unsigned length)\n{\n  if (! length)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n  }\n  if (! context || ! message_array)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;\n  }\n  if (context->computed)\n  {\n    context->corrupted = 1;\n    return SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (context->corrupted)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR;\n  }\n  while (length-- && ! context->corrupted)\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++]\n      = (*message_array & 0xFF);\n    context->length_low += 8;\n    if (context->length_low == 0)\n    {\n      context->length_high++;\n      if (context->length_high == 0)\n      {\n        context->corrupted = 1;\n      }\n    }\n    if (context->message_block_index == 64)\n    {\n      SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n    }\n    message_array++;\n  }\n  return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (context->message_block_index == 64)\n    {\n      SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. Inside the loop, context->message_block_index is incremented on each input byte; when it becomes 64 the condition is true and SHA1ProcessMessageBlock(context) is executed to handle the full 512-bit block. Removing this call would change the SHA-1 behavior (blocks would not be processed), so this is not dead code."
