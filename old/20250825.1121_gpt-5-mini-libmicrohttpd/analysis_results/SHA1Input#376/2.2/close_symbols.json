Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For MISRA dead-code analysis we must know not only the text of SHA1Input but the concrete types, state layout, and how other functions change that state or call SHA1Input. Each listed symbol is required for these reasons:\n\n- struct SHA1Context (full definition including field types for: computed, corrupted, message_block, message_block_index, length_low, length_high): to determine whether assignments/updates in the function can change program behaviour. In particular, the integer widths/signedness of length_low/length_high determine whether the length overflow test (== 0) can ever be true; message_block_index type and message_block layout determine whether the array write has observable effects or is out-of-bounds; computed/corrupted types and semantics determine whether the early-return/flag-setting statements are meaningful or redundant.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (implementation): the loop calls this when message_block_index reaches 64. That function may reset message_block_index, update computed/corrupted, or otherwise influence observable state. Whether the array write and the call are necessary (or could be removed without effect) depends on what this callee does.\n\n- SHA1Reset (implementation): callers (e.g. ws_get_accept_value) likely initialize/reset SHA1Context. To know if certain branches (e.g. context->computed checks) are ever true/false in real usage, we must see how contexts are initialized or re-used.\n\n- SHA1Result (implementation): this routine commonly finalizes the digest and may set context->computed. To decide if the computed flag checks are meaningful (and thus whether setting corrupted or refusing input is dead), we need to see where and how computed is set/read elsewhere.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value (implementation): this is a static caller of SHA1Input (per the call graph). To determine whether parts of SHA1Input are ever executed in the product (and thus cannot be dead), we must inspect how ws_get_accept_value invokes SHA1Input (values passed for length, message_array, and how context is allocated/reused). If SHA1Input is always called with length==0 or with particular contexts, some code paths in SHA1Input could be provably dead.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT (definition/values): to correlate return codes to observable behaviour in callers (e.g. whether callers react to different return values), and thus decide if returning particular codes (and the checks that lead to them) have observable effect or could be removed.\n\nThese symbols provide the necessary type information, state-transition semantics, and calling-context usage to determine whether any operations inside SHA1Input are truly dead (i.e. can be removed without affecting program behaviour)."
