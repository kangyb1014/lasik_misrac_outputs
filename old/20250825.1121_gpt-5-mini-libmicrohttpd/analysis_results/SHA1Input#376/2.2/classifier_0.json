  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Input:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Input (struct SHA1Context *context, const unsigned char *message_array,\n           unsigned length)\n{\n  if (! length)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n  }\n  if (! context || ! message_array)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;\n  }\n  if (context->computed)\n  {\n    context->corrupted = 1;\n    return SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (context->corrupted)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR;\n  }\n  while (length-- && ! context->corrupted)\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++]\n      = (*message_array & 0xFF);\n    context->length_low += 8;\n    if (context->length_low == 0)\n    {\n      context->length_high++;\n      if (context->length_high == 0)\n      {\n        context->corrupted = 1;\n      }\n    }\n    if (context->message_block_index == 64)\n    {\n      SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n    }\n    message_array++;\n  }\n  return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (! context || ! message_array)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The null-pointer check is a runtime defensive check that affects behavior when length != 0 and either context or message_array is NULL. Although the check is skipped when length == 0 (the function returns earlier), that does not make it dead code \u2014 it is executed in other call paths and removing it would change program behavior (it would allow a subsequent dereference of a NULL pointer and cause undefined behaviour). Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
