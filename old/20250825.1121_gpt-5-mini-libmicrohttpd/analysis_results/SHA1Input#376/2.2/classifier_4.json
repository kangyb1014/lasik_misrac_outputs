  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Input:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Input (struct SHA1Context *context, const unsigned char *message_array,\n           unsigned length)\n{\n  if (! length)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n  }\n  if (! context || ! message_array)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_NULL;\n  }\n  if (context->computed)\n  {\n    context->corrupted = 1;\n    return SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (context->corrupted)\n  {\n    return SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR;\n  }\n  while (length-- && ! context->corrupted)\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++]\n      = (*message_array & 0xFF);\n    context->length_low += 8;\n    if (context->length_low == 0)\n    {\n      context->length_high++;\n      if (context->length_high == 0)\n      {\n        context->corrupted = 1;\n      }\n    }\n    if (context->message_block_index == 64)\n    {\n      SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n    }\n    message_array++;\n  }\n  return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (context->computed)\n  {\n    context->corrupted = 1;\n    return SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the statement 'context->corrupted = 1;' produces a persistent side\u2011effect on the context object before returning. That side\u2011effect is observable to callers or other functions that later examine context->corrupted, so removing it could change program behaviour. Therefore, based on the provided fragment, this is not dead code. (If in the full project it can be proven that the context is never inspected after this return or that the field is always unused, then the assignment could be dead \u2014 but no such evidence is present here.)"
