  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code fragment. The code only performs direct array indexing (context->message_block[context->message_block_index++]) and pointer incrementing (message_array++), neither of which involve the Standard Library string functions constrained by Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no string.h usages in this fragment that could cause out-of-bounds access under the scope of Rule 21.17 to report for investigation here. Note: although array indexing and index-management (message_block_index) could be a separate safety concern, it is not within the scope of Rule 21.17 (which specifically targets use of <string.h> functions). If inspection of other functions (for example SHA1ProcessMessageBlock or other translation units) is required, those bodies would need to be provided because any call to string.h functions could only be identified there; they are not present in the submitted code fragment."
