  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required\n\n1) struct SHA1Context (full definition)\n   - Needed to know exact array sizes and field types used by SHA1Input: message_block[] size, message_block_index type/range, length_low/length_high types and widths, and flags (computed, corrupted). These determine whether the indexing/assignments in SHA1Input can go out of bounds or cause integer wrap behavior that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses in string functions in callees.\n\n2) SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (full implementation)\n   - SHA1Input calls this function when message_block fills. To determine any violation of the <string.h> rule we must inspect this callee for any uses of memcpy/memset/etc or any array accesses on context->message_block (or other buffers) that could exceed bounds. If SHA1ProcessMessageBlock uses standard string.h routines, their argument ranges must be checked against buffer sizes.\n\n3) Any functions called by SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (their implementations/prototypes)\n   - If SHA1ProcessMessageBlock calls other functions, those may contain string.h calls or additional buffer accesses. The complete transitive set of implementations is needed to be certain no standard string functions are invoked with out-of-bounds pointers/lengths.\n\n4) Macro/constant(s) that define message_block size (e.g. SHA1 block size, 64)\n   - The numeric value(s) used to size message_block and any compile-time limits (macros like SHA1_BLOCK_SIZE) are necessary to verify indexing (message_block_index == 64) and sizes passed to any string.h calls.\n\n5) Types of context->length_low and context->length_high (their typedefs/width)\n   - Their integer widths determine wrap/overflow behavior when length_low increments by 8 and triggers length_high increments. Knowing widths is important to reason about wrap detection and whether unexpected values could be passed to string.h functions or used to compute lengths that would exceed buffer bounds.\n\n6) Any uses/implementations of <string.h> functions referenced by SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn)\n   - The MISRA rule applies only to these standard functions. If any of them are called (most likely memcpy/memset/memmove), we must inspect the exact call sites (source/destination pointers and length arguments) to ensure the pointer/length pairs cannot reference memory beyond the referenced objects. Provide the implementations/usages so the next analyst can verify argument bounds against the context and message_block sizes."
