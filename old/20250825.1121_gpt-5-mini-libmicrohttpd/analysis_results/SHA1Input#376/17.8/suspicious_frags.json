  "explanation": "The rule forbids modifying function parameters themselves. The two reported fragments modify parameter variables (the scalar parameter 'length' and the pointer parameter 'message_array') and therefore must be investigated. Other modifications in the function operate on objects pointed to by parameters or on local state and are allowed by the rule: e.g. context->message_block_index++, context->length_low, context->length_high, and writes into context->message_block modify the object referred to by the pointer parameter 'context' (permitted). The dereference (*message_array & 0xFF) only reads the pointee (permitted). Calls such as SHA1ProcessMessageBlock(context) do not modify the parameter variable itself. Hence no other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
