  "explanation": "To decide whether any code in SHA1Input is unreachable we must know how the function can actually be invoked and what the context state and field types/widths are. Each symbol is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- struct SHA1Context: The function reads and writes multiple fields (computed, corrupted, message_block_index, message_block, length_low, length_high). Their types, bit-widths and layout determine whether branches (e.g. length_low overflow -> length_high increment -> corrupted set) or comparisons (message_block_index == 64) can ever be true or false \u2014 essential to determine reachability of those code regions.\n\n- SHA1Reset: Callers often initialize SHA1Context via SHA1Reset. Inspecting SHA1Reset shows the initial values assigned to computed, corrupted, message_block_index, length_low/high, etc., so we can tell which branches in SHA1Input can be taken immediately after initialization (e.g. whether computed or corrupted can already be true, making some branches reachable/unreachable).\n\n- ws_get_accept_value: The static call graph shows this is the only caller of SHA1Input. To determine if certain branches are reachable (e.g. length == 0, context == NULL, message_array == NULL, or message lengths passed) we must inspect how ws_get_accept_value invokes SHA1Input (what arguments/lengths/pointer values it passes and whether it calls SHA1Reset beforehand). This is required to judge whether any lines in SHA1Input are dead code in the project.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: SHA1Input calls this when message_block_index == 64. To know whether that call site (and the surrounding block) is actually reachable, and how message_block_index is updated/reset (which affects future iterations), we need the implementation of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock \u2014 it may modify message_block_index and other fields in ways that affect reachability of subsequent code in SHA1Input.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT: While not strictly about control flow, the enum gives semantic meaning to return values and may be useful to confirm whether some return branches are intended to be used or are redundant. Including it keeps the analysis complete when deciding whether a return statement/branch is unreachable in practice.\n\n(Other symbols in the call graph, such as SHA1Result, BASE64Encode or ahc_cb, are not required to determine internal reachability of SHA1Input given the above items.)"
