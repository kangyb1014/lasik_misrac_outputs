  "explanation": "1) struct SHA1Context (full definition): SHA1Input dereferences and writes many members (message_block, message_block_index, length_low, length_high, computed, corrupted). To determine whether the context pointer could/should be const-qualified (or whether any members are pointers-to-data that might need const), the exact member types are required. If message_block were a pointer type, its pointed-to type constness must be known.\n\n2) SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (prototype + definition): SHA1Input calls this routine and passes the context pointer. To justify that context must be non-const (i.e. the pointer should not point to a const-qualified type), we must see whether SHA1ProcessMessageBlock mutates the context or any data reachable through it. Its prototype/definition shows whether it modifies context or underlying buffers.\n\n3) SHA1PadMessage (prototype + definition): SHA1PadMessage also calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock and is part of the same SHA1 implementation; examining it can reveal additional mutations of context or message buffers and confirm that context and its members must remain mutable.\n\n4) ws_get_accept_value (definition / caller site): SHA1Input has callers (notably ws_get_accept_value). Inspecting the caller shows how message_array and context are obtained/typed and whether any additional constness constraints are imposed by call sites. This helps confirm whether message_array being declared as pointer-to-const is appropriate and whether callers would expect different qualification.\n\n5) enum SHA1_RESULT (definition / typedef): The return type is an enum; although not directly about pointer constness, having the enum definition ensures correct interpretation of early returns and state-code paths when reasoning about whether the function modifies data and thus whether parameters must be non-const.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether the pointer parameters (especially context and message_array, and any pointer members inside context) are correctly const-qualified per the MISRA guideline that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
