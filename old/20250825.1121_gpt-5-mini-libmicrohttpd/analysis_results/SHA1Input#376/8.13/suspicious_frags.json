  "explanation": "I inspected all pointer usages in the function with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n\n- Parameters: There are two pointer parameters: struct SHA1Context *context and const unsigned char *message_array. message_array already points to a const-qualified type (const unsigned char) and therefore complies with the rule. The function increments message_array (message_array++), which modifies the pointer value but not the pointed-to type; this does not require changing the pointee qualification.\n\n- context is a non-const pointer and is used to modify the pointed-to object (context->corrupted, context->message_block[...] = ..., context->message_block_index++, context->length_low/length_high++, etc.). Because the function performs writes through context, it is correct that the pointee is not const; qualifying it const would prevent necessary modifications.\n\n- There are no other pointer variables or pointer-type expressions in the function that could be more const-qualified (no local pointer declarations, no pointers returned, no pointer-to-function usages).\n\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate Rule 8.13 and none require further investigation under that rule."
