First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The target rule (MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2) applies to the well-formedness of for statements. This code contains no for statements, so there are no direct for-loop constructs to inspect for the rule. However, the while-loop and several statements inside it perform loop-control-like modifications and side-effects (decrement in the loop condition, post-increment of an index, pointer increment, increments of length_high/length_low, setting of corrupted, and a function call inside the loop body). Those fragments are reported above because they should be reviewed to ensure equivalent requirements (single loop counter, no persistent side-effects in loop-control expressions, and no objects used by the loop control being modified elsewhere in the loop body or by called functions) are met. Other parts of the function (input validation checks, early returns, declarations, and simple conditional tests that do not affect loop control) are not relevant to Rule 14.2 and therefore do not need investigation for this specific rule."
