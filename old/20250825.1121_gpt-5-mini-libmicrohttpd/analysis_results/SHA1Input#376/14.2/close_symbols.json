The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct SHA1Context: The loop body reads and writes several context fields (message_block[], message_block_index, length_low, length_high, computed, corrupted) and the loop condition uses context->corrupted. To decide whether any of these objects violate the MISRA for-loop clauses (e.g. a loop control flag or loop counter is modified in the loop body, or an object used in the loop condition is also modified elsewhere), the exact types, sizes and semantics (e.g. integer widths, signed/unsigned, volatile, array bounds) of those fields are required. The struct also reveals whether message_block_index is intended as a loop counter and whether its modifications in the body are allowed.  \n\n2) SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: This function is invoked from inside the loop; MISRA explicitly states that the behaviour of called functions is part of the loop body. We must inspect its implementation to determine if it modifies any objects used as loop counters or loop-control flags (for example context->message_block_index, context->corrupted, or other context fields), or has persistent side effects that would make a for statement using these objects ill-formed. Its prototype alone is insufficient; the implementation is needed to see side effects.  \n\n3) enum SHA1_RESULT: Provides the symbolic return values used by the function (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS, SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR, SHA1_RESULT_NULL). While not directly affecting the loop-formation rule, the enum clarifies semantic intent of state/error flags and helps determine whether fields like context->computed or context->corrupted are treated as boolean control flags (as MISRA defines loop-control flags as Boolean objects)."
