  "explanation": "I have reported all controlling expressions in the function (all if and while conditions) so they can be checked against MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. Other code fragments (returns, assignments, increments, array indexing, function calls, and non-controlling expressions) are not relevant to Rule 14.3 because that rule concerns invariance of controlling expressions. The remaining statements are either non-controlling (assignments, updates to context fields, function calls) or use variables/fields that are modified within the function scope, so they are not constant/invariant by construction and do not require separate investigation for this specific rule."
