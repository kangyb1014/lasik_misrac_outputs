  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in SHA1Input is invariant you must know what can change at runtime. Specifically:\n\n- struct SHA1Context (complete definition from the header): the controlling expressions reference context->computed, context->corrupted, context->message_block_index, context->length_low and context->length_high. You need the full struct to know each member's type and qualifiers (e.g. volatile/const), whether any members are bitfields, and their widths \u2014 all of which affect whether comparisons/boolean tests can ever change during execution.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (full implementation): this function is called from inside the loop and from the message_block_index check. It may modify context members (message_block_index, corrupted, length fields, etc.). To determine whether the loop condition (length-- && ! context->corrupted) or the internal if (context->message_block_index == 64) can change across iterations, you must inspect what SHA1ProcessMessageBlock does to the context state.\n\n- typedefs / integer-width definitions used in SHA1Context members (e.g. exact types of length_low, length_high, message_block_index, corrupted, computed): knowing the precise integer types (and any signedness/width) is necessary to determine whether operations like context->length_low += 8 can wrap to zero, whether comparisons are well-defined, and therefore whether expressions such as (context->length_low == 0) or (! context->corrupted) can become true/false and are non\u2011invariant.\n\nThese symbols together let you determine whether each controlling expression in SHA1Input (if (!length), if (!context || !message_array), if (context->computed), if (context->corrupted), while (length-- && ! context->corrupted), if (context->message_block_index == 64), and the nested checks on length_low/length_high) can change during execution or are effectively invariant."
