  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for use of compiler language extensions:\n\n- _MHD_EXTERN\n  - Reason: This macro prefixes the function and may expand to compiler-specific storage-class or attribute syntax (for example __attribute__((...)) or __declspec(...)). To determine whether the target uses a documented compiler extension you must see the macro expansion/definition.\n\n- MHD_get_timeout64 (declaration/definition)\n  - Reason: The target calls this function and takes its return value/semantics. Its prototype or definition may contain compiler-specific extensions (attributes, calling-convention specifiers, nonstandard types) that would cause the target to use an extension indirectly. Inspecting its declaration/definition is necessary to detect such extensions.\n\n- MHD_NO\n  - Reason: This macro/enum/constant is used in the conditional. Its definition could use nonstandard constructs or types (macro tricks, compiler-specific constants). You need its definition to ensure no extensions are introduced via its use.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (declaration/definition)\n  - Reason: The target uses a pointer to this struct. The struct definition could contain nonstandard features (flexible array members, unnamed bit-fields, packed/aligned attributes, compiler-specific pragmas/attributes). Those would be language extensions relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\n- int64_t, uint64_t\n  - Reason: These typedef names come from <stdint.h> or equivalent headers. While standardized in C99, some implementations provide them via compiler/CRT-specific typedefs or macros (or use compiler builtin types). To be certain no extension is used you must check how these integer types are provided on the target platform.\n\n- INT64_MAX\n  - Reason: This macro is used in the comparison. Its definition originates from the same headers as int64_t and may be implemented via compiler-specific constants. Inspecting its definition rules out use of implementation-specific/extension constructs.\n\nIn short: to decide whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must examine the macro expansions and the declarations/definitions of all nonbuilt-in identifiers and types the function depends on (_MHD_EXTERN, MHD_get_timeout64, MHD_NO, struct MHD_Daemon) and the platform typedefs/macros for fixed-width integers and limits (int64_t, uint64_t, INT64_MAX)."
