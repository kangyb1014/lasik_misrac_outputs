  "explanation": "No code fragments appear to be statically unreachable. Each conditional and return in the provided functions can be exercised depending on runtime state or compile-time configuration: \n\n- MHD_get_timeout64s: Both return paths are reachable: MHD_get_timeout64 can return MHD_NO (causing MHD_get_timeout64s to return -1) or MHD_YES with a uint64_t timeout value; the subsequent comparison against INT64_MAX is reachable if the returned timeout exceeds INT64_MAX at runtime.\n\n- MHD_get_timeout64: All return statements (MHD_NO / MHD_YES) are reachable depending on daemon flags, EPOLL_SUPPORT/UPGRADE_SUPPORT/HTTPS_SUPPORT compile-time configuration and the presence or absence of timed-out connections. Conditional blocks are guarded by macros or runtime flags, so they are not dead code in the build configurations that enable them.\n\n- connection_get_wait: The branches handling timeout < since_actv, the nested large-since_actv check, the small jump_back case (return 100), the exact-match case (since_actv == timeout), and the normal remaining-time path are all reachable depending on the monotonic clock values and connection timeout fields. The inner arithmetic uses unsigned semantics so the nested conditions can occur when clock adjustments (clock jumps) or wrap-around scenarios happen. The mhd_assert does not create unreachable code in normal builds; it documents an expected precondition but the function still handles timeout-related cases at runtime.\n\nAdditionally, there are no clearly contradictory conditions (e.g., if (X) { ... } else if (!X) { ... } with the else-if guarding an impossible condition) or code after unconditional returns that is unreachable. Compile-time-guarded code is only excluded/included based on the corresponding macros; that is expected and does not constitute unreachable code in builds where the macro is enabled.\n\nTherefore, no fragments need further investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want, I can re-evaluate with specific build-time macro settings or hypothetical runtime values that you consider impossible/irrelevant to confirm particular paths."
