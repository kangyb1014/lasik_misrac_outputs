  "explanation": "- MHD_get_timeout64 (full definition/implementation): The target function\u2019s behavior (and whether the middle branch can ever be taken) depends entirely on the values MHD_get_timeout64 can place into the uint64_t utimeout and on whether it ever returns MHD_NO. You must inspect its implementation to determine the possible numeric range(s) of utimeout and any special sentinel values it produces. If MHD_get_timeout64 never yields utimeout > INT64_MAX then the `if (INT64_MAX < utimeout)` branch in the target function is dead.\n\n- MHD_NO (return-code constant/value used by MHD_get_timeout64): The first conditional return in the target function tests against MHD_NO. You need the exact definition/semantics of MHD_NO to know under what conditions the early return (-1) occurs and whether that code path is reachable or redundant.\n\n- connection_get_wait (definition called by MHD_get_timeout64): MHD_get_timeout64 calls connection_get_wait (according to the call graph). connection_get_wait may compute or limit the timeout value; its logic can allow utimeout values that exceed INT64_MAX or not. Inspecting it is required to know whether the INT64_MAX clamp in the target is meaningful.\n\n- Any constants/macros used inside MHD_get_timeout64 that set/saturate the timeout value (e.g. an \"infinite\" sentinel or UINT64_MAX): Many timeout implementations use special sentinel constants (e.g. an infinite timeout encoded as a large uint64_t). Those constants determine whether utimeout can exceed INT64_MAX. You must include those symbol definitions to judge whether the target function\u2019s clamp/return is ever executed or is dead.\n\n- INT64_MAX (limits.h): The branch compares utimeout to INT64_MAX; the exact limit value is required to reason about whether some utimeout values can exceed it.\n\n(You do not need MHD_DLOG for dead-code analysis of the target function\u2019s conditional logic because logging calls affect observability but do not change the numeric range decisions; include it only if side-effect logging removal must be considered as affecting program behaviour.)"
