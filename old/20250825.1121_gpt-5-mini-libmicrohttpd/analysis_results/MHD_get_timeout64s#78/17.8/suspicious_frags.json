  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The only function parameter is a pointer: 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon'. The code does not assign to or alter the parameter itself (no '=' to daemon, no increment/decrement, no pointer arithmetic). The pointer is only passed to MHD_get_timeout64(daemon, &utimeout) \u2014 passing a pointer parameter to another function is allowed so long as the pointer itself is not modified here; modification of the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule. The remaining operations only modify a local variable (utimeout) and perform comparisons/casts; these do not modify any function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
