  "explanation": "- MHD_get_timeout64: The target calls this function and returns its result. To determine whether any string.h functions (or out-of-bounds pointer accesses) are used on data reachable from the target, the full definition/implementation of MHD_get_timeout64 must be inspected (and its callees).\n- MHD_DLOG: MHD_get_timeout64 is listed as calling MHD_DLOG; logging helpers often format or copy strings. Include its definition to check whether it (or functions it calls) uses string.h APIs that could access buffers passed from the daemon.\n- connection_get_wait: Also called by MHD_get_timeout64. Its implementation might use string functions or operate on buffers reachable via the daemon pointer; include it for the same reason.\n- struct MHD_Daemon: The daemon pointer is an input to the target and is forwarded into MHD_get_timeout64. The layout/fields of this struct are needed to determine whether any pointer parameters passed into string functions inside callee code reference buffers whose bounds could be exceeded.\n- MHD_NO: The return-value macro/enum constant used to test MHD_get_timeout64\u2019s result. Knowing its definition ensures the return-path analysis is correct (which paths lead to early return vs. further processing in callees).\n- uint64_t, int64_t: The integer types used for the timeout value and cast. Their definitions (from <stdint.h>) and semantics are necessary to reason about casting/overflow behavior that might affect buffer sizes or indices if any string operations are later performed on derived values.\n- INT64_MAX: The comparison constant used in the function. Its definition (from <limits.h>) is required to reason about the boundary check and whether any downstream code could use the (possibly truncated) timeout to compute buffer lengths or indices that are used with string.h functions.\n\nNote: If MHD_get_timeout64, MHD_DLOG, or connection_get_wait call additional functions, their implementations (and any string.h usage) must also be provided to complete the MISRA C string-bounds analysis."
