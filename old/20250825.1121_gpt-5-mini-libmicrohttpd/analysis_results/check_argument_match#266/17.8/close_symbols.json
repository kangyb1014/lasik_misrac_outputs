  "explanation": "MHD_parse_arguments_: You must inspect its declaration/definition to confirm it is a function (not a macro) and to see the exact parameter types (e.g. whether it takes char * or char ** or uses any macro trickery). If it were a macro or took a pointer-to-pointer it could conceivably cause apparent modification of the caller's parameter \u2014 knowing its form is required to determine whether the target function itself modifies its parameters.\n\nstruct MHD_Connection: The type and layout (particularly the rq member) are needed to verify that accesses like connection->rq.headers_received are member accesses on the object pointed to by the parameter (allowed) and not some macro-expanded operation that reassigns the parameter itself. It also confirms that \"connection\" is indeed a pointer parameter and how its fields are used.\n\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: Definition (members kind and next) is needed to confirm that the loop only reads fields from the pointed-to headers and advances a local pointer (pos), and that no assignment to the function parameter variable occurs via these member accesses.\n\nstruct test_header_param: The local structure assigned from the parameter (param.connection = connection) must be known to confirm that only a local copy of the pointer is stored (allowed) and that no aliasing or macro causes write-back to the parameter variable.\n\ntest_header: The callback passed to MHD_parse_arguments_ should be known (signature/type) so you can confirm that nothing in the call expression could modify the parameter variables in the caller via macro or inlined constructs. (Primarily, this helps ensure MHD_parse_arguments_ is a normal call and not a macro that manipulates caller variables.)\n\nenum MHD_Result and MHD_NO: Needed to understand the return type check (MHD_NO == ret) \u2014 to ensure that the control flow is normal and that no hidden side effects (e.g. via bizarre macro expansions of these symbols) are present that could alter the function parameters.\n\nMHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND: The constant used in comparisons inside the loop should be inspected to rule out it being a macro or function-like construct that could modify parameters when used (very unlikely but must be checked to be certain the target function does not modify its parameter variables)."
