  "explanation": "No other fragments in this function directly invoke or pass buffers to standard <string.h> functions. The local declarations (structs, enum, and param initialization) and the loop that iterates connection->rq.headers_received only examine pointer fields and an enum value (pos->kind) and decrement an integer counter; they do not call string-handling functions or pass string buffers to external APIs in this snippet. The only potential sites that can lead to out-of-bounds string operations are the input pointer 'args' and the call to MHD_parse_arguments_ (which receives args and the test_header callback). Therefore those are the only fragments flagged for investigation. All other lines do not present direct risks under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 within this code fragment."
