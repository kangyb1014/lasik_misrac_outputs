  "explanation": "For determining whether any pointer in check_argument_match should be const-qualified you must see the declarations/types the function uses and what the callee expects or stores:\n\n- MHD_parse_arguments_: its prototype (parameter types and const-qualifiers) is required because check_argument_match forwards connection and args to it. If MHD_parse_arguments_ expects non-const pointers, the parameter here cannot be made const without changing the callee.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the connection parameter type must be inspected to see whether its fields are const-qualified and whether the function only reads from it (so the parameter could be a pointer-to-const) or if non-const is required.\n\n- type of connection->rq (the rq struct/type): check_argument_match reads connection->rq.headers_received; you need the definition of the rq member type to know the declared const-qualification of headers_received and whether assigning it to a (possibly const) local pointer is allowed.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: the pos variable points to this type and the code reads pos->kind and pos->next; you must see whether the struct and its next pointer are const-qualified so you can judge whether pos should be a pointer-to-const.\n\n- struct test_header_param: param is passed to MHD_parse_arguments_ and contains a connection field assigned from connection; its field types (e.g., whether connection is declared as pointer-to-const) affect whether connection could/should be const in this function.\n\n- test_header (callback): the callback's prototype (type of its parameters) passed to MHD_parse_arguments_ is needed because it may require non-const pointers to args or headers; that constrains whether args or header pointers in this function can be const.\n\n- MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND and enum MHD_Result: the constants and result type are included to check whether any of the comparisons/assignments involve differing const-qualifiers or have typedefs that affect pointer constness (and to ensure complete understanding of callee expectations when these constants are part of signatures).\n\nProviding these declarations/definitions lets the next analyzer determine whether any pointer (connection, args, pos, or fields inside param) can or should be qualified with const according to the MISRA guideline."
