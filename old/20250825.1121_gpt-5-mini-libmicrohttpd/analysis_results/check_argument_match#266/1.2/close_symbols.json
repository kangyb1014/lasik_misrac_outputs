  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses compiler language extensions (MISRA check), the analyzer must inspect the declarations and definitions the function relies on, because extensions can appear there rather than in the function body. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- bool (stdbool.h or typedef): The source uses the identifier bool; we must confirm this is the standard C99/C11 _Bool via <stdbool.h> or a compliant typedef, not a compiler-specific extension or macro.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The connection parameter type may include nonstandard constructs (bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, flexible array members, anonymous structs/unions, or compiler extensions) that would violate the rule.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection::rq member type/definition: The code accesses connection->rq; the rq member\u2019s type may hide extensions (anonymous structs/unions, attributes).\n\n- headers_received (type of connection->rq.headers_received): This pointer\u2019s type must be inspected for flexible array members, packed/attribute annotations or other extensions.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop iterates this type; its definition may contain extensions (anonymous/unnamed fields, GCC attributes, typeof in macros, bit-field widths).\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::next and ::kind: These members are referenced; their declarations must be checked for exotic types or extension usage (e.g., enum extensions, non-standard bit-fields).\n\n- enum MHD_Result: Ensure the enum is standard C and not defined using compiler-specific extensions (extended enum underlying types, attributes).\n\n- MHD_NO: A constant used in comparison; its definition may be a macro using extensions or an expression relying on extension behaviour.\n\n- MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND: Macro/constant used for comparison; must be checked for non-standard macro constructs (typeof, statement expressions, GNU extensions).\n\n- struct test_header_param (definition): The local struct instance members (connection, num_headers) must be checked for nonstandard types or attribute annotations.\n\n- MHD_parse_arguments_ (prototype and/or definition): This callee\u2019s declaration can include compiler-specific function attributes (e.g., __attribute__, calling convention macros), use of varargs in non-portable ways, or GNU extensions in parameter types; its signature also determines if passing &test_header and &param is compliant.\n\n- MHD_parse_arguments_ implementation details (uses/forwards): Because it calls MHD_unescape_plus and may itself use extensions, inspecting its implementation helps reveal any propagated nonstandard constructs that affect the call site semantics.\n\n- MHD_unescape_plus (prototype and/or definition): As a transitive callee, it may use language extensions in its declaration/definition that indicate extension usage in the codebase.\n\n- Any header/macros that expand to compiler-specific attributes used by the above (e.g. attribute macros, calling-convention macros): Many projects hide __attribute__ or other extensions behind macros; these must be located and examined to decide if compiler extensions are used.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their declarations and/or definitions) lets the next agent detect compiler-specific keywords, attributes, anonymous/unnamed struct/union usage, statement expressions, typeof, extended enums, inline-assembly or other documented compiler extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
