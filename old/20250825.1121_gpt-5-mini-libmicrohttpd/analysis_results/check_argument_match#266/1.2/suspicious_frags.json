  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I reviewed the target function and the related type definitions for usage of compiler-specific language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (examples checked: __attribute__, __asm__/asm, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __extension__, __builtin_*), as well as other common vendor extensions (zero-length arrays, unnamed struct/union extensions, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers). None of these appear in the provided code. The code uses standard C constructs only: enums, structs, pointers, conditional compilation (#ifdef), standard types (size_t, socklen_t, bool assuming stdbool.h), and ordinary function calls/returns. Conditional compilation and external library types (e.g. gnutls_session_t) are not language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in the supplied snippets."
