  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to determine a MISRA memcmp violation in check_argument_match:\n\n- MHD_parse_arguments_: The target directly calls this function. To know whether check_argument_match causes a memcmp (or leads to one) you must inspect MHD_parse_arguments_ implementation for any memcmp calls or for places it invokes callbacks that might use memcmp when comparing strings.\n\n- MHD_unescape_plus: Shown in the static call graph as a callee of MHD_parse_arguments_. Any memcmp usage could occur in this helper; it must be inspected because it is reachable from the target path.\n\n- test_header: This is the callback passed into MHD_parse_arguments_. The callback implementation is a prime location where memcmp might be used to compare argument names or values; you must inspect it to see whether memcmp is applied to null-terminated strings.\n\n- struct test_header_param: The callback receives/updates this struct (e.g. num_headers). Its fields and how they are used may influence code paths and string handling inside test_header or MHD_parse_arguments_, so the struct definition is required to understand argument semantics and whether string comparisons occur.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The target reads connection->rq.headers_received and passes connection into MHD_parse_arguments_. You must inspect the connection definition to understand data ownership and whether strings in the connection (headers, names, values) are NUL-terminated or binary (affects whether memcmp use would be a MISRA violation).\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop in check_argument_match iterates these nodes (pos) and checks pos->kind and pos->next. You need the struct to know what fields (e.g. name/ value pointers and lengths, termination guarantees) exist and whether any comparisons elsewhere use memcmp on possibly NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and MHD_NO: To fully understand the control flow (early returns) you need the enum and its symbolic values so you can determine which code paths (and thus which callees) can execute and be analyzed for memcmp usage.\n\n- MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND: The kind value is compared in the loop and passed to MHD_parse_arguments_; knowing its definition clarifies which arguments/pathways are processed and whether string comparisons occur for specific kinds.\n\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function itself must be inspected where it is called (if present in any of the above symbols) to determine whether its arguments are null-terminated C strings (which would violate the MISRA rule). Including memcmp as a symbol ensures the reviewer checks all occurrences, signatures, and argument semantics.\n\nIn short: to decide whether check_argument_match (directly or indirectly via its callees/callbacks) causes memcmp to be used to compare null-terminated strings you must examine the implementations and data/layout of MHD_parse_arguments_, MHD_unescape_plus, the test_header callback, the parameter and connection/header structures, the relevant enums/macros controlling flow, and any memcmp calls found there."
