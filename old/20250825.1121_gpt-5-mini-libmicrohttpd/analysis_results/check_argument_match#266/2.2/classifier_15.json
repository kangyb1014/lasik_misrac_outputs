  "scenario": "The line is a debug assertion (mhd_assert(NULL != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt)); it performs a runtime check in debug builds and may abort when the condition fails. Removing it would change observable behaviour in those builds (it would no longer detect/abort on a NULL request-target). Therefore it is not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note: in release builds the mhd_assert macro may be a no-op (so the check is not executed there), but Rule 2.2 concerns operations that are executed; the assertion is executed in debug configuration and its removal would affect behaviour, so no violation."
