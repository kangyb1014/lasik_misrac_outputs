  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_poll participates in direct or indirect recursion we must inspect every callee it directly dispatches to and any functions those callees might invoke that could lead back to MHD_poll (or to MHD_polling_thread which itself calls MHD_poll). Reason for each symbol:\n\n- MHD_poll_all \u2014 direct callee of MHD_poll; its body may call back to MHD_poll (indirect recursion) or invoke other functions that do.\n- MHD_poll_listen_socket \u2014 direct callee of MHD_poll; same rationale as MHD_poll_all.\n- resume_suspended_connections \u2014 called by both MHD_poll_all and MHD_poll_listen_socket in the static graph; it could call into other components (including threads or poll functions) that form a cycle back to MHD_poll.\n- new_connections_list_process_ \u2014 callee of MHD_poll_all / MHD_poll_listen_socket; must be checked for any calls that eventually reach MHD_poll or the polling thread.\n- MHD_accept_connection \u2014 callee of MHD_poll_all / MHD_poll_listen_socket; might call connection/handler code that leads back to polling functions.\n- call_handlers \u2014 callee of MHD_poll_all; handlers often perform complex actions and could call back into daemon/polling APIs; must be inspected.\n- MHD_DLOG \u2014 logging function called by poll helpers; included to confirm it does not indirectly call back into polling code (usually benign, but verify no unexpected callbacks).\n- get_timeout_millisec_int \u2014 utility called by MHD_poll_all; include to confirm it has no side effects that could trigger recursion.\n- MHD_polling_thread \u2014 the thread function that calls MHD_poll; if any callee of MHD_poll (or their transitive callees) calls MHD_polling_thread, that would create an indirect recursion (MHD_poll -> ... -> MHD_polling_thread -> MHD_poll).\n- MHD_epoll, MHD_select, MHD_cleanup_connections, close_all_connections \u2014 callees of MHD_polling_thread shown in the graph; include them because they might also be invoked (directly or indirectly) from functions called by MHD_poll_all / MHD_poll_listen_socket and thus complete a recursion cycle.\n\nInspecting the definitions of these symbols (and any further callees they use) is necessary to prove absence or presence of any path from MHD_poll back to itself (directly or indirectly), which is what the MISRA rule forbids."
