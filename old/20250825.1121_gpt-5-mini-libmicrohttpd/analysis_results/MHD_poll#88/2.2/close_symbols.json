  "explanation": "To decide whether MHD_poll contains dead code (i.e. executed operations whose removal would not change program behaviour) we need to know: \n\n- MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_: This predicate controls which branch is taken. Its definition determines whether the branch choice can vary at runtime or is effectively a compile-time constant (if constant, one branch may never be executed and that affects dead-code analysis). \n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: The predicate almost certainly inspects fields of the daemon object. The daemon layout and fields used by the predicate are required to determine runtime variability of the branch decision.\n\n- build/configuration macros used by MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ (compile-time flags): If the predicate depends on build-time options, the branch may be statically determined; those config symbols are needed to decide reachability/variability.\n\n- MHD_poll_all and MHD_poll_listen_socket: The two branch targets are the operations whose presence/absence we must judge. We need their full implementations to determine their side effects (network accept, state changes, logging, timers, etc.) to know whether removing one branch would change program behaviour.\n\n- MHD_polling_thread: It is the only caller shown in the static graph. Its code shows how and when MHD_poll is invoked and what may_block value(s) are used; that affects whether either branch is actually executed in deployed scenarios and whether removal would alter timing/behaviour.\n\n- resume_suspended_connections, new_connections_list_process_, MHD_accept_connection, call_handlers, get_timeout_millisec_int, MHD_DLOG: These functions are called (directly or indirectly) by MHD_poll_all and/or MHD_poll_listen_socket according to the call graph. Their semantics (especially side effects such as accepting connections, resuming work, logging, or changing timers) are required to assess whether eliminating one branch would change observable program behaviour (thus not dead) or be removable without effect (dead).\n\nIn short, we need the predicate definition and related configuration, the daemon structure, the two branch implementations, the caller(s) to assess reachability and call contexts, and the important subroutines used by those branch implementations to reason about side effects and observable behaviour."
