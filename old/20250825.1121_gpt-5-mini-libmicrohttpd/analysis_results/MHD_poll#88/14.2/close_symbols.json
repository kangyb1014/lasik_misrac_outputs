The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "MHD_poll itself contains no for loop, so to decide MISRA compliance we must inspect the code of the functions it calls (because MISRA treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body). Explanations per symbol: \n\n- MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_: This macro/function controls which branch is taken. Its definition is needed to ensure there are no hidden for-loops or side effects influencing loop control when evaluating either branch. It may also reference struct MHD_Daemon fields used by the branch selection.\n\n- MHD_poll_all: Primary callee for the non-thread-per-connection case. We must inspect its body for any for loops and verify the three clauses meet MISRA constraints and that called functions inside those loops do not produce forbidden side-effects.\n\n- MHD_poll_listen_socket: Primary callee for the thread-per-connection case. Same reason as MHD_poll_all: inspect its for loops and ensure called functions inside loops do not violate the rule.\n\n- resume_suspended_connections: Called by both MHD_poll_all and MHD_poll_listen_socket. If invoked inside a for loop in either function, its body contributes to the loop behaviour (side effects, modifications of loop counter or other objects), so its definition is required.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: Logging routine called from the poll functions; if called from within a for loop its side effects need to be known (e.g., whether it modifies any objects used as loop counters or control flags).\n\n- get_timeout_millisec_int: Used by MHD_poll_all; if used in loop clauses or called inside a loop, its side effects or use of global state may affect MISRA analysis.\n\n- new_connections_list_process_: Called by both poll functions; may contain loops or modify objects that are used as loop counters or loop-control flags in the callers \u2014 must inspect its body.\n\n- MHD_accept_connection: Called by both poll functions; may have side effects relevant to loop control (e.g., modifying connection counts used in loop conditions) and must be checked if invoked inside loop bodies.\n\n- call_handlers: Called by MHD_poll_all and likely invoked within connection-processing loops; its body must be examined for side effects that would affect loop well-formedness.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: The daemon type is referenced by the macro and passed to callee functions; its definition is needed to understand whether fields accessed/modified by callees are used as loop counters or control flags.\n\nNote: After inspecting the above symbols, you may need to recursively request definitions of any additional callees that contain for loops or that are invoked from within for-loop bodies in those functions. The provided list is the minimal set derived from the static call graph that must be examined to determine MISRA C 'for loop well-formed' compliance for MHD_poll and its immediate transitive behaviour."
