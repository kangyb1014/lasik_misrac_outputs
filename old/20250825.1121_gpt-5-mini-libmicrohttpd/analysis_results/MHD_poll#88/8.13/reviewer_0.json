If MHD_poll does not modify the daemon object and only reads it (it calls a predicate macro MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ and forwards the pointer to MHD_poll_all / MHD_poll_listen_socket), the pointer should be const-qualified: 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon'. As written, without evidence that daemon is modified, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s observation about the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is correct in spirit: where a function does not modify the object pointed to, the pointer parameter should be to a const-qualified type. However, from the single snippet provided you cannot definitively conclude there is a MISRA violation. Whether the pointer can/should be made const depends on the wider context: the signatures of MHD_poll_all and MHD_poll_listen_socket (and any macros used) and whether they require a non-const pointer or actually modify the daemon. Because MHD_poll forwards the pointer to those functions, changing this parameter to const would only be possible if the callees\u2019 prototypes also accept a pointer-to-const (or they do not modify the object). Without examining those prototypes (and any API boundary or intentional design choices), the claim of a definite Rule 8.13 violation is not proven. If those callees accept non-const and/or modify the daemon, the current declaration is appropriate. If they do not and can be changed, then the parameter should be made const to satisfy Rule 8.13. In short: the report is a plausible suggestion but not demonstrably correct from the code shown \u2014 more context is required."
