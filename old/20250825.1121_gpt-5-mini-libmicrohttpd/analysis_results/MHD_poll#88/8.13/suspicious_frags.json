  "explanation": "The only pointer present in this function is the parameter 'daemon'. No other pointer variables or pointer casts appear in the function body, so there are no additional pointer-related fragments to investigate. The three uses of 'daemon' in the body (the macro call and the two function calls) along with the function parameter declaration cover all places where a pointer to MHD_Daemon is involved; these should be checked to determine whether 'struct MHD_Daemon *' could be changed to 'const struct MHD_Daemon *'. The remaining tokens (the enum return type, the integer parameter 'may_block', literals, and control flow) do not involve pointers and therefore do not relate to Rule 8.13."
