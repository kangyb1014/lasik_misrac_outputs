  "explanation": "For MISRA C string-boundary analysis you must inspect any functions or data that MHD_poll dispatches to and any data structures that control that dispatch. Rationale for each symbol:\n\n- MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_: This macro/function decides which branch MHD_poll takes. You must know its definition to determine which callee(s) to analyze and whether different code paths might invoke string.h functions.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: The daemon structure holds sockets, buffers, flags and pointers passed to callees. Its layout and relevant fields are required to determine the sizes and lifetimes of buffers that might be used by string functions in callees.\n\n- MHD_poll_all: Direct callee of MHD_poll. Its implementation must be examined for any uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/strlen/strcpy/etc., and for how it passes buffers/sizes to deeper functions.\n\n- MHD_poll_listen_socket: Direct callee for the other branch. Like MHD_poll_all, its body may call string functions (directly or via callees) so it must be inspected.\n\n- resume_suspended_connections: Called by both MHD_poll_all and MHD_poll_listen_socket per the call graph. This routine likely manipulates connection buffers when resuming I/O and therefore is a prime candidate for copying/moving memory \u2014 inspect for string.h usage and bounds checks.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: Logging helper used by the callees. Logging code may call strlen/memcpy or format functions that take string inputs; check how logged strings are formed and whether they could be out-of-bounds.\n\n- get_timeout_millisec_int: Called by MHD_poll_all (per the call graph). Although it may be arithmetic-only, it influences timeout behavior (may_block) and thus code paths; include it to be certain it does not interact with buffers or call string.h functions.\n\n- new_connections_list_process_: Processes newly accepted connections (per the call graph). It likely initializes connection state and may copy strings (addresses, headers) into connection structures \u2014 inspect for unsafe uses of string functions and correct bounds handling.\n\n- MHD_accept_connection: Accepts and initializes a connection. Acceptance and initialization often involve copying peer addresses, headers or initial data; its body must be checked for string.h usage and correct length/size arguments.\n\n- call_handlers: Called by MHD_poll_all; this dispatches requests to user or internal handlers which commonly process headers and payloads (strlen, memcpy, memcmp, strcpy, etc.). Handlers and the way request buffers are passed must be inspected to guarantee no out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nNote: Each listed function may itself call further functions that use string.h routines. When analyzing for MISRA rule violations, inspect the implementations of these symbols and any nested callees they invoke, and the relevant fields of struct MHD_Daemon to verify buffer sizes and bounds checks."
