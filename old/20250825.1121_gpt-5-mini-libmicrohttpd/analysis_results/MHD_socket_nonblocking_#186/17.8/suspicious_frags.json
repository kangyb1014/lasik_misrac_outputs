  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter 'sock'. In both conditional branches, 'sock' is only used as a value argument to system calls (fcntl or ioctlsocket) and is never assigned to, incremented, or otherwise altered. The local variables named 'flags' are distinct local objects (one int in the POSIX branch, one unsigned long in the WinSock branch) and their modification does not affect the parameter. The pointer-specific allowance in Rule 17.8 (that the object pointed to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified) is not applicable here because MHD_socket is an integer typedef, not a pointer. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
