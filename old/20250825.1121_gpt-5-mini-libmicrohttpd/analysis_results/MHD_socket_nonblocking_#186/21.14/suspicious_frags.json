  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function MHD_socket_nonblocking_ only calls fcntl and ioctlsocket (depending on platform), manipulates integer flags, and returns an integer value. There are no string variables, no char* or null-terminated string operations, and no other standard library string/comparison functions used in this fragment. Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp usage exists elsewhere in the project it is not in the submitted snippet and would need to be reviewed separately."
