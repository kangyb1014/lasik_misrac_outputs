  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Analysis summary:\n\n- There are no pointer declarations or pointer-type parameters in MHD_socket_nonblocking_. The function signature uses MHD_socket which is typedef'd to int, not a pointer.\n- The POSIX branch only uses integer values (flags) and passes them by value to fcntl; no pointer is involved that could be const-qualified.\n- The only pointer use is in the Windows branch: &flags passed to ioctlsocket. That pointer targets an object that is (and must be) modified by ioctlsocket, so it cannot (and should not) be const-qualified \u2014 thus it does not violate the guidance to use const where possible.\n\nBecause there are no pointers that could reasonably be made to point to const-qualified types, there are no fragments to report for further investigation under Rule 8.13."
