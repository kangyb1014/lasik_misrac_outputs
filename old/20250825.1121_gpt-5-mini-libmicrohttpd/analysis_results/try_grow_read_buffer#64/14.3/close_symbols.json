  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to determine whether any controlling expression in try_grow_read_buffer is invariant:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function tests and uses many connection members (read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset, read_buffer, pool, daemon). To show that expressions such as (0 == connection->read_buffer_size), connection->read_buffer != NULL, and left_free = connection->read_buffer_size - connection->read_buffer_offset are or are not invariant you must know the member types and whether they are modifiable/const, their widths/signedness and any invariants imposed by the type or surrounding code. The field definitions also show whether accesses may be aliased or volatile.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: def_grow_size = connection->daemon->pool_increment. To determine whether def_grow_size is a compile-time or run-time constant (and thus whether comparisons involving def_grow_size might be invariant) you need the daemon structure definition and whether pool_increment is a fixed/constant value.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: avail_size is set from this call and then used in several controlling expressions (if (0 == avail_size), grow_size = avail_size / 8, comparisons like small_inc < avail_size). You must know whether MHD_pool_get_free is a simple function/macro that can return varying values (and whether it has side effects) or is a constant/inline that would make avail_size invariant.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: used directly in a controlling expression: (NULL != connection->read_buffer) && ! MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace(...). To decide if that controlling expression can be considered invariant, you need the function prototype/semantics and whether it could return a constant value for the given pool/read_buffer combination.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: although not part of a controlling expression before the call, its semantics matter for reasoning about invariance of subsequent checks/assignments and to ensure no hidden side effects could retroactively make earlier controlling expressions effectively invariant in the running context. Also helps to confirm that earlier predicates (e.g. is_resizable_inplace) are meaningful.\n\n- MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE: used in the constant-expression-like computation of small_inc = ((MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE > def_grow_size) ? def_grow_size : MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE) / 8. If MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE is a compile-time constant macro this can affect whether small_inc (and therefore small_inc < avail_size) is invariant; you need its definition.\n\n- mhd_assert: assertions are used after some computations and an mhd_assert(0) is present on unexpected paths. To be confident that assertions do not change behavior (e.g., are implemented as no-ops in production), and thus to treat the controlling expressions as ordinary runtime checks (not compile-time removed), you need the macro/implementation.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any of the if/conditional controlling expressions in try_grow_read_buffer are invariant (constant true/false) you must know the layout and mutability of the connection/daemon fields and the definitions/semantics of pool-related functions and relevant macros (MHD_POOL_* functions, MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE) and whether mhd_assert changes control flow. These symbols are the minimal set required to assess invariance under MISRA C rule analysis."
