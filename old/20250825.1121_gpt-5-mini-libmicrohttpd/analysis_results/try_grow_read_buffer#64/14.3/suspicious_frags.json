  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant (constant) and thus no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Reasoning: \n\n- There are no iteration statements in this function (no for, while or do-while loops). The rule targets invariant controlling expressions of iteration statements; the provided exceptions (infinite loops, do-while constant-false) are not relevant because there are no loops.\n\n- All conditional/controlling expressions that do exist depend on variables or function calls, so they are not invariant at compile time:\n  - if (0 == avail_size) \u2014 depends on avail_size\n  - if (0 == connection->read_buffer_size) \u2014 depends on connection->read_buffer_size\n  - if (def_grow_size > grow_size) \u2014 depends on grow_size (computed at runtime)\n  - if ((def_grow_size <= grow_size + left_free) && (left_free < def_grow_size)) \u2014 depends on grow_size and left_free\n  - else if (! required) \u2014 depends on parameter required\n  - if (small_inc < avail_size) \u2014 depends on small_inc and avail_size\n  - if ((NULL != connection->read_buffer) && ! MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace(...)) \u2014 depends on connection->read_buffer and the result of the function call\n  - if (NULL == rb) \u2014 depends on the return value of MHD_pool_reallocate\n\n- The ternary operator used to compute small_inc is an expression, not an iteration-controlling expression; even so it depends on def_grow_size (runtime) and/or MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE (macro), so it is not an invariant controlling expression of a loop.\n\n- mhd_assert(0) appears but is not a loop control expression \u2014 it is an assertion (and would be a constant only within the assertion), so it does not trigger Rule 14.3.\n\nTherefore there are no suspicious code fragments to report for Rule 14.3 in this function."
