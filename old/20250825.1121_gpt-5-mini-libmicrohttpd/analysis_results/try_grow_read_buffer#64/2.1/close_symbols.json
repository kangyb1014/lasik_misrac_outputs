  "explanation": "To decide whether any branches in try_grow_read_buffer are provably unreachable you must know the possible runtime values and invariants that control those branches. Concretely:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the function reads/writes several members (pool, read_buffer, read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset, daemon). Knowing the types, initial values and invariants for these fields is essential to tell whether branches depending on read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset or read_buffer are reachable.\n\n- connection->daemon (pool_increment): def_grow_size is taken from daemon->pool_increment and directly affects the arithmetic and comparisons that drive several branches (the def_grow_size > grow_size path and subsequent adjustments). You must know its range/possible values.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: the first branch (if (0 == avail_size) return false) depends entirely on whether this function can return 0 for the given connection->pool. Its semantics and possible return values determine reachability of that early return.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: the code checks this and returns false (and asserts) if it is not resizable in-place. If this function is guaranteed to return true for buffers allocated by the usual code paths, that branch (assert + return false) may be unreachable; otherwise it is reachable.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: two branches depend on its behavior: whether it can return NULL (the NULL == rb branch with mhd_assert(0)) and whether it can return a different pointer (the code asserts rb == connection->read_buffer). Its contract governs reachability of both the NULL-error branch and the assert-right-after reallocation.\n\n- MHD_pool_allocate: referenced in the comment as a possible reason for a bad state (allocation without from_end). To determine whether the failure branches are actually reachable you need to know how buffers are normally allocated in the pool (i.e., whether any code can allocate in a way that invalidates the assumptions used here).\n\n- MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE: used to compute small_inc in the 'mandatory grow but shortage' path. Its value/range affects whether the small_inc < avail_size branch or avail_size branch is taken and thus whether particular sub-branches are reachable.\n\n- mhd_assert: the code uses mhd_assert(0) in two places. Whether those statements abort the program, are no-ops in release builds, or have other side effects influences whether the subsequent code (e.g. the return after the assert) is reachable in practice. For MISRA unreachable-code analysis you must know the actual expansion/behavior of this macro/function.\n\n- check_and_grow_read_buffer_space: this caller determines how try_grow_read_buffer is invoked (notably the value of the 'required' parameter). If that caller always calls try_grow_read_buffer with required == true (or always false) some branches (the !required return) could be unreachable; analyze the caller to know which values are possible.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_: this allocator/initializer (listed in the call graph) likely sets initial values for read_buffer_size/read_buffer/offset. To determine if the read_buffer_size == 0 branch or other branches are reachable you must know initialisation semantics.\n\n- connection_shrink_read_buffer: other routines that change read_buffer_size/offset/position can create/avoid states that make branches reachable. Knowing how these routines modify the connection fields is necessary to rule branches in or out.\n\nIn short: you need the struct definitions and all pool/allocator APIs and the caller(s) that set the 'required' flag and initialize/modify the buffer state to determine which conditional blocks in try_grow_read_buffer can actually be reached at runtime."
