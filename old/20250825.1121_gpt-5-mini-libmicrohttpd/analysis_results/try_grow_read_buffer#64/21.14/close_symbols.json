  "explanation": "To determine whether try_grow_read_buffer (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must be able to inspect any code that might call memcmp or treat buffers as NUL-terminated strings. The listed symbols are required as follows:\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: Called by try_grow_read_buffer. Must be inspected for any use of memcmp (or string comparisons) or any behavior that could make buffers be treated as strings.\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: Called by try_grow_read_buffer. Must be inspected for any use of memcmp or routines that compare/inspect buffer contents as strings (this is the most likely place an indirect memcmp could occur).\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: Called by try_grow_read_buffer. Must be checked for memcmp usage or string assumptions about buffers.\n- MHD_pool_allocate: Part of the same pool API/implementation family; try_grow_read_buffer's comments mention other pool allocation behavior. Include it so the pool implementation can be reviewed transitively for memcmp usage or conventions about NUL-termination.\n- mhd_assert: The assertion macro may expand to other helpers; include it to ensure no indirect memcmp usage or string comparisons occur in assert-handling code.\n- MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE: Constant/macro used to compute increments; include it to fully understand computed sizes and whether any code later treats buffers as strings (size math can affect string-related code paths).\n- struct MHD_Connection: Definition is needed to confirm the types/semantics of read_buffer, read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset and pool pointer \u2014 to show these are raw byte buffers (not C strings) and to check whether any field access could lead to string comparisons.\n- struct MHD_Daemon: Needed because connection->daemon->pool_increment is used; include to understand any daemon-level policies/functions that might perform string operations on pool buffers.\n- memcmp: The standard function itself must be searched for in the above functions/implementations to detect any usage and then determine whether it is ever applied to null-terminated strings (the MISRA violation).\n\nIn short: inspect the pool API implementations (get_free, reallocate, is_resizable_inplace, allocate), the connection/daemon types, the assert macro and relevant macros/constants, and search for memcmp uses in those places. This set lets the next agent determine whether any indirect or direct call to memcmp compares null-terminated strings in the context of try_grow_read_buffer."
