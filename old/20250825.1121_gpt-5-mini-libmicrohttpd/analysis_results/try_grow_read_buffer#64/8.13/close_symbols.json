  "explanation": "For deciding whether any pointer in try_grow_read_buffer should be const-qualified we must know how those pointers are declared and used elsewhere. Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - Required to see the exact type and qualifiers of connection->read_buffer, connection->pool and related members (read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset, daemon). If read_buffer is declared as void * (non-const) in the struct that strongly affects whether it can/should be const.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon\n  - Needed so the type of daemon->pool_increment is visible (not directly about pointer constness but required to fully resolve types inside MHD_Connection and any related casts/uses).\n\n- struct MHD_Pool\n  - Pool APIs take a pool object; the pool API prototypes may use pointers to pool internals or to buffers. Knowing the pool type helps find the exact pool API signatures that affect buffer pointer constness.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace\n  - Prototype/signature needed to see whether this function takes a const void * or void * for the buffer parameter. If the API requires a non-const pointer, connection->read_buffer cannot be const.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate\n  - Prototype/signature required to determine whether it accepts/returns const-qualified pointer types. It directly takes and returns the read_buffer pointer; a non-const parameter/return type forces non-const usage.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free\n  - Prototype (return/type) to fully resolve types used in the function; not directly about pointer constness but included for completeness of pool-related API analysis.\n\n- connection_shrink_read_buffer\n  - This function is listed as a caller of MHD_pool_reallocate and therefore likely manipulates connection->read_buffer. Its implementation/signature is required to see whether it writes to or passes the buffer as non-const, which prevents qualifying the pointer as const.\n\n- connection_maximize_write_buffer\n  - Another function that interacts with pool and buffers; its uses of connection->read_buffer (or related buffers) must be checked for non-const access.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_read\n  - Likely reads data into connection->read_buffer (i.e., writes to the buffer). Its code/signature is essential to determine if the buffer contents are modified, which would preclude const qualification.\n\n- try_ready_chunked_body\n  - A caller of MHD_pool_get_free/MHD_pool_reallocate; may access or mutate the read buffer contents. Need its implementation to check for non-const usage of the buffer.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_\n  - Calls MHD_pool_reallocate; its prototype/implementation helps determine how buffer pointers are passed/used and whether the API expects non-const pointers.\n\n- MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE\n  - Macro/constant used in size calculations; included so the analyzer has the full context of growth logic (not a pointer type, but included for completeness). \n\nIn short: to decide whether connection->read_buffer (and any other pointers in the function) could/should be const-qualified you must inspect the struct field declarations and every API and internal function that takes or manipulates that pointer (especially MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace and MHD_pool_reallocate and all call sites that may write into or reallocate the buffer). Without these symbols you cannot determine whether const qualification is permissible or would break existing non-const usages."
