  "explanation": "To determine whether try_grow_read_buffer violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect recursion we must examine any functions it calls (and any functions that could call it back). Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: Direct callee. We must inspect its body (including any callbacks or function-pointer invocations) to ensure it does not call try_grow_read_buffer (directly or via a chain).\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: Direct callee. Same rationale: if this routine (or any functions it calls) can invoke try_grow_read_buffer (or a caller of it), an indirect recursion cycle could exist.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: Called in the target function (the static call graph given omitted it, but it appears in the source). It must be checked for any call path back to try_grow_read_buffer (including via function pointers or global callbacks).\n\n- mhd_assert: Appears in the function source. If implemented as a function (not a pure macro) it must be inspected to ensure it cannot call into application code that leads back to try_grow_read_buffer. If it is purely a macro/inline that cannot call back, this can be noted.\n\n- check_and_grow_read_buffer_space: Direct caller of try_grow_read_buffer (per the graph). To detect indirect recursion we must verify whether any functions reachable from try_grow_read_buffer can in turn call this caller (or any other caller of try_grow_read_buffer), closing a cycle.\n\nNote: The goal is to examine all reachable call paths starting from try_grow_read_buffer (its callees and their transitive callees) and all callers of try_grow_read_buffer (and their callers) to see if any path returns to try_grow_read_buffer. The symbols above cover the immediate nodes necessary to start that transitive exploration; depending on findings, the analysis may need to be extended to additional transitive callees/callers discovered within these functions."
