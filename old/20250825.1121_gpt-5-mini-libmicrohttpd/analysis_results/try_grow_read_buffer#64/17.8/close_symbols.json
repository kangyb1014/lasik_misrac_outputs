  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for checking the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): needed to confirm which identifiers are fields of the pointer parameter (connection). The rule allows modifying the object pointed-to (fields) but forbids assigning to the parameter variable itself; knowing the exact field names and types (read_buffer, read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset, pool, daemon) is required to distinguish permitted field updates from any accidental reassignment of the parameter.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (full definition / type of connection->daemon): required because the code reads connection->daemon->pool_increment. You must verify that accessing this nested pointer does not involve any macro or inline function that could reassign the top-level parameter 'connection'.\n\n- type/definition of connection->pool (pool type, e.g. MHD_Pool): the pool object is passed into pool helper functions. Its definition lets you check whether any operations on the pool (or macros manipulating it) could expand to code that assigns to the local parameter variable 'connection'.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free (declaration/definition): the call could be a macro or inline function. To be sure the parameter 'connection' or 'required' is not reassigned indirectly, inspect its definition/implementation for side effects or macro expansions that reference/assign to local names.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (declaration/definition): same reason \u2014 if implemented as a macro or inline, it could expand into code that touches the function parameters; need its definition to rule out any reassignment of 'connection' or 'required'.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate (declaration/definition and implementation/macro): this is a key call that returns rb and is passed connection->read_buffer and connection->read_buffer_size; if it is a macro or inline helper it might contain unexpected assignments. Inspecting its real code ensures the function does not reassign the 'connection' parameter variable (or the 'required' parameter) via macro expansion or side effects.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/definition): mhd_assert is a macro and could expand into code with commas, temporary assignments, or calls that reference identifiers; verify it does not perform any assignment to the parameter identifiers (e.g., via a macro argument evaluation that has side effects). Also ensures assertions don't hide illegal assignments.\n\n- MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE (macro/constant): included because it is used in arithmetic to compute small_inc. If it is a macro expression it may expand in unusual ways; inspect it to ensure it does not expand to something that assigns to local identifiers.\n\nNote: The focus of these symbols is to detect any direct or indirect (via macros/inline helpers) assignment to the parameter variables 'connection' or 'required'. Field modifications of *connection are allowed by the MISRA rule, so knowing the structure fields is necessary to classify those accesses correctly."
