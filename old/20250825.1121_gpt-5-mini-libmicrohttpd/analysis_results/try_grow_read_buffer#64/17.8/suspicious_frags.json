  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies a function parameter variable itself. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the parameter variable (e.g. doing `connection = ...;` or `required = ...;`) while allowing modification of the object pointed to by a pointer parameter. In this function: - There is no assignment to the parameter identifiers `connection` or `required`. - All writes operate on members of the object pointed to by `connection` (e.g. `connection->read_buffer = rb;`, `connection->read_buffer_size = new_size;`), which is permitted by the rule. - All other uses of the parameters are reads (e.g. `connection->daemon->pool_increment`, `connection->read_buffer_offset`). Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing to flag for investigation under that rule."
