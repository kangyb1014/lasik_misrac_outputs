  "explanation": "To determine whether try_grow_read_buffer violates the MISRA rule about <string.h> functions accessing out-of-bounds memory we must know how it computes sizes and how the pool operations behave internally: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function directly reads and updates read_buffer, read_buffer_size and read_buffer_offset and uses connection->pool and connection->daemon. Exact field types, invariants and alignment are needed to verify the arithmetic (new_size/grow_size) and to ensure calculated sizes do not exceed or underflow object bounds.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (pool_increment): The default grow size (def_grow_size) comes from daemon->pool_increment; its value and semantics influence grow_size/new_size calculations and whether subsequent memory operations are safe.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free: The returned avail_size is used to bound new_size and grow_size. Precise units and guarantees (e.g., free bytes available for the pool, whether value can change concurrently) are required to check that new_size never requests more space than is actually available and thus to reason about any subsequent memory operations.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: The code relies on this predicate to assert that the buffer will not be moved. We must know exactly what true/false mean and what guarantees are provided (i.e., that resizing in place will not relocate the buffer and will not require copying) to reason about whether further operations can cause out-of-bounds accesses or hidden memcpy/memmove calls.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: This is the critical symbol. The function delegates the actual resizing to MHD_pool_reallocate; we must know if that implementation can internally call string.h functions (memcpy/memmove/memset/etc.), whether it can move the buffer, whether it might read/write beyond the supplied old_size/new_size (bugs or intentional copies), and what pointer it returns (same pointer or new). Without this, we cannot conclude the target function itself causes or avoids any out-of-bounds string.h usage \u2014 any such use would happen inside pool reallocation.\n\n- MHD_pool_allocate: The code comment references MHD_pool_allocate and a 'from_end' parameter as a possible root cause of misplacement. Understanding allocation semantics (how allocations change pool layout and when reallocate must move/copy) helps determine whether try_grow_read_buffer can ever cause a reallocate that copies data and therefore whether string.h functions might be invoked.\n\n- MHD_BUF_INC_SIZE: Used to compute small_inc and thus grow_size/new_size in corner cases. Its numeric value affects whether the code chooses branches that might trigger different pool behavior; must be known to reason about size arithmetic and potential overflows or under-provisioning.\n\n- mhd_assert: Knowing whether assertions are active or compiled out matters because the function relies on assertions to detect unexpected states (e.g., pool not resizable in place, or reallocate returning NULL). If assertions are stripped in production, behavior differs; this changes whether the function might proceed in a state that could allow buffer moves and internal string.h calls.\n\nIn short: the function itself does not call any <string.h> APIs, so proving MISRA compliance requires visibility into the pool APIs and related constants/macros (their prototypes, semantics and internal implementation details) and the connection/daemon data layout so we can determine whether any memcpy/memmove/memset/etc. might be called with incorrect bounds as a result of this function's actions."
