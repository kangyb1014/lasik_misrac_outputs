  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise altered in this function. The parameters algo3, username, realm and userhash_bin are only used as values in expressions or passed to other functions; none of them are modified (no assignments, increments/decrements, or address-of (&) operations that would allow a callee to change the parameter itself). The call calc_userhash(..., userhash_bin) may modify the object pointed to by userhash_bin, but MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 permits modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter \u2014 it only forbids modifying the pointer variable itself. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that require investigation under Rule 17.8."
