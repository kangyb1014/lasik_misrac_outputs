  "explanation": "To determine whether cleanup_upgraded_connection violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls, the analyzer must inspect every function or path that could lead back to cleanup_upgraded_connection (or to MHD_cleanup_connections, which is a known caller). The listed symbols are required for the following reasons:\n\n- gnutls_bye\n  - It is called inside the function (when TLS is enabled). Its implementation or call graph must be inspected to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call cleanup_upgraded_connection or any function that leads to it.\n\n- GNUTLS_SHUT_WR\n  - Constant/enum used with gnutls_bye; included for completeness to determine whether the call is meaningful in the build/configuration being analyzed.\n\n- MHD_socket_close_chk_\n  - Called to close sockets. Its implementation/call graph must be examined to ensure it does not call back into the MHD code that could trigger cleanup_upgraded_connection.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET\n  - Compile-time/runtime constant tested before calling MHD_socket_close_chk_. Needed to know whether the socket-close calls are actually reachable.\n\n- free\n  - Standard library free is called to release urh. Its behavior is normally safe, but the allocator or custom free wrapper (if overridden) could have hooks; verify that free (or any wrapper used) does not call into the daemon cleanup paths.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (compile-time macro)\n  - Controls whether the TLS/socket-close code is compiled. The recursion analysis must be done for the concrete build configuration, so this macro is needed.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS (daemon option flag)\n  - Runtime option tested to decide whether gnutls_bye is invoked; needed to know whether that call can occur in the execution paths.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition)\n  - The structure layout is required to confirm types of fields accessed (urh, daemon, tls_session) and to discover any function pointers embedded in those types that might be invoked indirectly.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (definition)\n  - The urh object is freed and its mhd/app subobjects are accessed; their types/fields must be known to determine whether accessing or closing them can trigger callbacks into cleanup paths.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition) and connection->daemon->options (field)\n  - The daemon object and its options field are inspected to determine whether MHD_USE_TLS applies and to reveal any function pointers or callback fields that could be invoked by callees and lead to recursion.\n\n- connection->tls_session (field)\n  - Passed to gnutls_bye; the session object type could carry callbacks or lifecycle hooks \u2014 verify no indirect call path to cleanup_upgraded_connection.\n\n- urh->mhd.socket and urh->app.socket (fields)\n  - These socket fields are tested & passed to MHD_socket_close_chk_. Their types/associated close semantics must be known to see whether closing them can trigger further MHD code that calls back.\n\n- MHD_cleanup_connections\n  - It is a caller of cleanup_upgraded_connection (from the static call graph). Include it to confirm there is no mutual recursion (i.e., cleanup_upgraded_connection -> ... -> MHD_cleanup_connections -> cleanup_upgraded_connection).\n\n- call graph / definitions of each callee (gnutls_bye, MHD_socket_close_chk_, free)\n  - For indirect recursion detection you must examine the call graph or source of each callee to ensure there is no path back to cleanup_upgraded_connection (or to functions that call it). If any callee calls (directly or indirectly) cleanup_upgraded_connection or MHD_cleanup_connections, that would create disallowed indirect recursion.\n\nIn short: include the function callees, the compile-time switches that enable those calls, the relevant structure definitions and fields accessed (in case they contain callbacks), and the call graph/definitions for each callee so you can trace any possible path back to cleanup_upgraded_connection or its callers."
