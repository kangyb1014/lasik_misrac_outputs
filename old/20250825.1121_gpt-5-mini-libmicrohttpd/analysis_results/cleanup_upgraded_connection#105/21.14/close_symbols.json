  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule \u2018memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings\u2019 in the context of this function you must inspect any symbols that the function uses or calls (and the types of members it accesses) to ensure no string comparisons via memcmp occur either here or inside callees. Brief reasons: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection: required to see the exact types of members accessed (urh, daemon, tls_session) and whether any are strings or string-like objects that could be compared with memcmp.\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: to inspect the urh contents and member types (mhd, app) to determine whether their socket members are string types or integer handles.\n- struct MHD_Daemon: to inspect the options member type (bitmask or other) used in the TLS check; ensure options is not a string compared via memcmp.\n- urh->mhd (type and definition): mhd is accessed for its socket member; need its type to ensure socket is not a char* or string.\n- urh->app (type and definition): same reason as mhd \u2014 inspect socket type.\n- field: MHD_Connection::urh: to confirm pointer lifetime/ownership and whether cleanup/free usage could involve string comparisons elsewhere.\n- field: MHD_Connection::tls_session (type/definition): gnutls_bye is invoked with this; inspect its type to find if any string comparisons are involved.\n- field: MHD_Daemon::options (type/definition): to confirm bitwise test is numeric and not a masked string comparison.\n- MHD_socket_close_chk_: must inspect this function implementation to ensure it does not call memcmp on null-terminated strings (or otherwise use memcmp incorrectly).\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: constant used in comparisons with urh socket members \u2014 need its type and value to ensure the comparison is numeric, not string-based.\n- gnutls_bye: the TLS shutdown call \u2014 inspect its implementation or wrapper to ensure it does not internally use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- GNUTLS_SHUT_WR: constant passed to gnutls_bye; include to understand semantics passed to gnutls_bye.\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: conditional compilation macro \u2014 needed to know whether TLS/socket close code is present in the build being analyzed.\n- MHD_USE_TLS: option flag tested against daemon->options \u2014 include to confirm this is a numeric flag, not a string comparison.\n- free: standard library free is called on urh; include to confirm no indirect use of memcmp (very unlikely but include for completeness).\n\nOnly these symbols are necessary to determine whether this function (or functions it directly invokes/uses) performs forbidden memcmp-based null-terminated string comparisons."
