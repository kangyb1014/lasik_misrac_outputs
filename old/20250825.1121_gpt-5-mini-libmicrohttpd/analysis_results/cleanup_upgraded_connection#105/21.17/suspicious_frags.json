  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in this function. The code contains no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or any other standard string-handling routine, nor any manual pointer/array string manipulation that could result in out-of-bounds access. The only external calls are gnutls_bye and MHD_socket_close_chk_, which are not string.h functions; their internals would need separate review but are outside this translation unit. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.17 compliance."
