  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of cleanup_upgraded_connection:\n```c\nstatic void\ncleanup_upgraded_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = connection->urh;\n\n  if (NULL == urh)\n    return;\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  /* Signal remote client the end of TLS connection by\n   * gracefully closing TLS session. */\n  if (0 != (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS))\n    gnutls_bye (connection->tls_session,\n                GNUTLS_SHUT_WR);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->mhd.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->mhd.socket);\n\n  if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->app.socket)\n    MHD_socket_close_chk_ (urh->app.socket);\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n  connection->urh = NULL;\n  free (urh);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic void\ncleanup_upgraded_connection (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The single fragment shown (a static function definition) is not by itself evidence of dead code. However, a specific violation would occur if this static function is never called anywhere in the same translation unit (i.e. no references to cleanup_upgraded_connection exist). Because it is declared static its linkage is internal, so an unreferenced static function would be dead code. Detection: a compiler warning (e.g. -Wunused-function) or a search showing no callers would confirm the violation. Remediation: remove the function if unused, or make it non-static/extern and ensure it is called if intended."
