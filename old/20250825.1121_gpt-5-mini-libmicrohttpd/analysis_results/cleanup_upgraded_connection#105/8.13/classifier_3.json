  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer connection->tls_session is passed to gnutls_bye which operates on (and likely modifies) the session object; therefore the pointer must be to a non-const object. Rule 8.13 requires adding const only when the pointed-to object is not modified \u2014 that does not apply here. A violation would occur if the code passed or stored a pointer to an object that is never modified but whose type is not const-qualified (for example, using a non-const pointer to read-only data), but that is not the case in this fragment."
