  "explanation": "To determine MISRA C compliance about const-qualified pointers you must see the concrete declarations and types used by the function so you can tell (a) which variables are pointers, (b) whether they are modified in this function, and (c) whether their types could/should be const-qualified. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): shows the exact type and qualifiers of connection->urh, connection->daemon and connection->tls_session, and whether the function mutates any fields (e.g., connection->urh = NULL) that prevent const qualification of the connection pointer or its members.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (definition): required to know whether urh itself is a pointer to a modifiable object and to inspect the types/qualifiers of its members; whether urh can/should be declared const if only read.\n\n- definition of the type of urh->mhd and definition of the type of urh->app: these member types (and whether their socket fields are pointers or integer handles) determine if any pointer being accessed could be const-qualified or if they are non-pointer scalar/socket types (in which case const-qualification of a pointer argument is irrelevant).\n\n- MHD_socket_close_chk_ (declaration / prototype): shows the parameter types used when closing sockets; if the function expects a non-const pointer, that may force the socket object type to be non-const; if it takes a non-pointer (e.g. integer socket), constness is not applicable.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET (macro / constant and its type): knowing the type of this constant tells whether urh->mhd.socket and urh->app.socket are integer/socket types rather than pointer types (affects whether const applies).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition) and MHD_USE_TLS (macro): required to know types and qualifiers of daemon and options fields and whether daemon/tls_session are pointers that could/should be const.\n\n- declaration of gnutls_bye and the gnutls_session_t (or tls_session) type and GNUTLS_SHUT_WR: needed to know whether connection->tls_session is a pointer type and whether gnutls_bye accepts a const-qualified session; that determines if tls_session could be declared const in the daemon/connection structs.\n\n- free (prototype): shows that urh is passed to free (requires a modifiable/non-const pointer to free), so urh cannot be const-qualified. Including free's signature clarifies that freeing prevents const qualification of urh.\n\nProviding these definitions/prototypes lets the analyzer decide which pointer types are actually modifiable or required by called APIs and therefore determine whether any pointers in the target function should have been declared with const (or whether the existing non-const declarations are justified)."
