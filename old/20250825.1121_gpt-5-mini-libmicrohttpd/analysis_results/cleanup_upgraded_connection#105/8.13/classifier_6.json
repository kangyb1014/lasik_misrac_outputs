  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The pointer connection->urh is being cleared after the object is freed (free(urh)); this indicates ownership and the pointer must be mutable so it can be cleared and the pointee freed. Making the pointee const would prevent legal modifications/cleanup. Therefore Rule 8.13 (prefer const-qualified pointee when possible) does not require changing this pointer to point to a const-qualified type here."
