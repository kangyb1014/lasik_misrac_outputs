  "scenario": "The local pointer urh is used to free the referenced object (free(urh)) and to close sockets via urh->mhd/...; because the object\u2019s lifetime is ended (deallocation) and free expects a void * (discarding const would require a cast), making urh a pointer-to-const is not practical. Therefore it is acceptable that urh is not const-qualified in this function."
