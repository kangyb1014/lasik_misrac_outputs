  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The local variable urh is a pointer to a non-const struct and is used to release (free) the allocated object. Rule 8.13 recommends const qualification when possible, but here the object is being deallocated (and its fields potentially modified/used), and free() expects a pointer to modifiable storage (void *). Making urh point to a const-qualified type would be inappropriate and would require casting away const when calling free. Therefore this use does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
