  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is invariant. The only control statements are: (1) if (NULL == urh) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of urh; (2) the #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT preprocessor conditional \u2014 preprocessor conditionals are not MISRA Rule 14.3 controlling expressions at C level; (3) if (0 != (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS)) \u2014 depends on the runtime field connection->daemon->options and a bitwise test, not a compile-time constant; (4) if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->mhd.socket) and if (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->app.socket) \u2014 depend on the runtime socket values in urh. None of these are invariant (always true or always false) at C runtime. Also there are no loops (so the exceptions for infinite loops or do-while constant false do not apply). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
