  "explanation": "For determining whether any of the controlling expressions in cleanup_upgraded_connection are invariant the analyser must know the exact definitions and possible runtime variability of the values tested. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): needed to know the types of connection->urh, connection->daemon and connection->tls_session and whether any of those are const or otherwise invariant. Also required to find all code paths that can modify those members.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (definition): needed to know the structure of urh, specifically fields urh->mhd.socket and urh->app.socket and their types/semantics so the comparisons against MHD_INVALID_SOCKET can be evaluated for invariance.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition): needed to know the type and semantics of the options field (connection->daemon->options) and whether options is a runtime-modifiable field or a compile-time constant.\n\n- connection->urh assignment sites (functions/locations that set or clear connection->urh): to determine whether the test if (NULL == urh) can ever evaluate true/false at runtime we must examine all code that sets or clears connection->urh (i.e. where it is assigned non-NULL or NULL).\n\n- places that initialize/allocate/free urh (functions that malloc/set/free the upgrade handle): to know lifetime and possible invariance of urh (e.g. if urh is always NULL or always non-NULL for a given connection), the allocator/teardown code that creates and frees urh must be inspected.\n\n- daemon->options initialization/modification sites (functions that set daemon->options): to decide if (0 != (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS)) is invariant we need to know where and how daemon->options is set/changed (at daemon creation only or modifiable later).\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS (macro/flag value): the bitmask value is required to evaluate the bit-test expression and to judge whether it is constant/non-changing across runs or per-daemon.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (compile-time macro): the presence or absence of this macro determines whether the TLS/socket-closing code (and therefore those controlling expressions) are even present in the compiled function; evaluating invariance requires knowing whether this conditional compilation branch is active.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET (macro/constant): needed to know the value and type used to represent an invalid socket and whether comparisons against it are meaningful or constant for the given socket type.\n\n- type of socket fields (e.g. MHD_socket_t or underlying type of urh->mhd.socket and urh->app.socket): to determine semantics of the comparisons (MHD_INVALID_SOCKET != urh->mhd.socket) and whether the socket fields can change at runtime, the concrete socket type and any invariants on it are required.\n\nWith these symbols/locations available the next analyser can decide if any of the if() controlling expressions are compile-time or runtime invariants (or allowed exceptions) per MISRA C."
