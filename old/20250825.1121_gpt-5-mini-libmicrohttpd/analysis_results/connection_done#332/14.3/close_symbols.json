  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- struct Request (full definition): The controlling expression uses req->timerfd. To decide whether the comparison \"-1 != req->timerfd\" is potentially invariant a static analyser must know the exact type and qualifiers of timerfd, and whether it is a plain integer, const, volatile, atomic, etc. The definition also shows whether timerfd can be a constant, an alias, or has attributes that affect its mutability.\n\n- close (declaration / prototype and documented return semantics): The inner controlling expression uses the result of close(req->timerfd). To determine if \"0 != close(req->timerfd)\" can be invariant, the analyser needs the return type and the documented return values/semantics of close (e.g. returns 0 on success, -1 on error, side-effects). Also the prototype rules out it being a macro or something with different semantics.\n\n- functions that allocate/initialize/modify struct Request::timerfd (all sites that write that field): Whether req->timerfd is invariant depends on where and how it is set or changed. The analyser needs to inspect all code paths that initialize or mutate timerfd (allocation/constructor, setup/close routines, signal handlers, threads) to decide if the value is fixed at compile-time or can vary at runtime.\n\n- any qualifiers on struct Request::timerfd (e.g. volatile, const, _Atomic) as found in its definition: Qualifiers change the classification of the expression: a volatile or atomic field makes reads non\u2011invariant, while const might make it invariant. These qualifiers are part of the struct definition but are highlighted because they directly determine whether the controlling expression can be considered invariant.\n\n- free (declaration/prototype): free is called after the conditional checks. While free does not affect the controlling expressions directly, the analyser should know its prototype to confirm it has no relevance to the value of timerfd or the result of close (and to detect misuse that could influence invariance reasoning via undefined behaviour after free). Including it ensures complete understanding of side-effects in the function.\n\n- abort (declaration/prototype): abort is invoked when close(...) != 0. Knowing abort's behaviour (does not return) is useful for control\u2011flow reasoning when assessing whether the controlling expressions can be treated as invariant in the relevant control\u2011flow context.\n\nNote: The most critical symbols are the struct Request definition (including qualifiers) and the close declaration and semantics, plus all code that sets/modifies req->timerfd. Those determine whether the comparisons are compile-time or runtime invariant. The other declarations (free, abort) are included for completeness of control-flow / side-effect analysis."
