  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function. The remaining lines (function signature, the three (void) casts that silence unused-parameter warnings, and the closing brace) do not introduce unreachable code and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 2.1. No other constructs that typically produce unreachable code (e.g. code after an unconditional return, unconditional infinite loops that make later code unreachable, labels that are never referenced, or mutually exclusive compile-time conditionals removing all paths to a statement) are present outside the fragments listed above. The listed fragments are provided so other reviewers can check whether any of those control-flow interactions (nested if without braces, a non-returning call, dereference) lead to unreachable code in the broader project context."
