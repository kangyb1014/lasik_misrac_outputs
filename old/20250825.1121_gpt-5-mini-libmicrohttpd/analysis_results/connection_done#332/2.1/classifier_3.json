  "scenario": "The assignment 'struct Request *req = *req_cls;' simply dereferences the pointer parameter req_cls to initialize req. This does not create unreachable code: the statement is executable whenever the function is entered. There is no code path made impossible by this line. (Note: if req_cls were NULL this would be undefined behavior at run time, but that is not the same as unreachable code under MISRA Rule 2.1.)"
