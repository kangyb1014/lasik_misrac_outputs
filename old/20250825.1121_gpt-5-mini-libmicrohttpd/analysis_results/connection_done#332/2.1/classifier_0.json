  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The abort() call is reachable only when req->timerfd != -1 and close(req->timerfd) != 0; other execution paths reach free(req). Rule 2.1 would be violated if code existed that could never be executed (for example an unconditional abort() placed before code that follows on every path, e.g. abort(); free(req); with no conditional path to reach free), but that is not the case in the provided fragment."
