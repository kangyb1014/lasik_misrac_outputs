  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call free(req) is reachable in normal execution (it executes when either req->timerfd == -1 or close(req->timerfd) returns 0). The only paths that do not reach that statement are when close(...) returns non\u2011zero and abort() is invoked (abort() does not return), but that is a conditional runtime path, not code that is intrinsically unreachable. Thus Rule 2.1 is not violated for this fragment."
