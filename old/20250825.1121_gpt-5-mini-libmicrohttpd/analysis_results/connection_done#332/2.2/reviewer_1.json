  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements (void) connection; (and similarly (void) cls; and (void) toe;) are expression-statements that have no side effects; they are executed but their removal would not change program behaviour, so they meet the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note that unreachable code is excluded by the Rule \u2014 these statements are reachable and executed \u2014 so that exclusion does not apply.)\n\nRecommended remedies: remove those no-op statements and instead indicate unused parameters in ways that do not produce executed no-ops, e.g. omit parameter names if permitted by the function definition/context, or use a compiler-supported UNUSED/attribute macro that does not produce an executed expression. For example, if permitted: static void connection_done(void *cls, struct MHD_Connection * /*connection*/, void **req_cls, enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode /*toe*/) { ... }"
