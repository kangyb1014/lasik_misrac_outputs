  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library string functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 appear in the provided code. The rule applies to functions from <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc. The function connection_done only performs: a pointer dereference req = *req_cls, integer comparisons of req->timerfd, calls to close(), abort(), and free(), and casts to void for unused parameters. There is no char* or buffer manipulation, no call to any memcpy/str*/mem* family, and therefore no possibility in this fragment of accesses beyond object bounds via <string.h> functions. For these reasons, there are no code fragments here that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
