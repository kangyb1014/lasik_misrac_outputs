This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

    "struct Request (definition)",

  ],
  "explanation": "- struct Request (definition): The function dereferences req and passes the object to free and reads req->timerfd. To be sure the target function does not itself (directly or indirectly) invoke any string.h routines or cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds string accesses, the full definition of struct Request is required (to see if it embeds character arrays, pointers to string buffers, or function pointers that could be invoked elsewhere).\n\n- req->timerfd (member type): Knowing the exact type of timerfd (usually an int) confirms that the only operation performed on it (close(req->timerfd)) is not a string operation. If timerfd were some custom type with a close-like destructor, that would need inspection.\n\n- free (symbol / macro implementation): The standard free from <stdlib.h> does not call any string.h routines. However free could be replaced/wrapped by a project macro or custom allocator/cleanup function. Inspecting the actual free symbol (or macro) used by this translation unit ensures it does not call memcpy/strcpy/etc. and so is necessary to decide MISRA string\u2011handling violation.\n\n- close (symbol / macro implementation): close is expected to be the POSIX close system call and does not use string.h functions. If close is macroed/wrapped in the project (or a wrapper performs additional cleanup), that wrapper must be inspected to ensure it does not call any string.h function in an out\u2011of\u2011bounds way.\n\n- abort (symbol / macro implementation): abort is expected to be the standard function from <stdlib.h>; inspect whether it is the standard implementation or replaced by a project shim that might call string functions.\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule targets use of string.h functions. The shown function does not call any string.h functions directly. To conclude it does not violate the rule, you must confirm that none of the symbols it uses (struct contents or the called routines) are project replacements/wrappers that internally use the string functions in a way that could produce out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to make that determination."
