  "explanation": "struct Request (definition): needed to check whether the Request type embeds any inline functions, custom cleanup handlers, or string-data semantics that could cause memcmp to be used when the object is manipulated or freed. Even though C has no destructors, the Request definition can reveal macros, inline helpers or conventions used elsewhere that the analyzer must inspect for memcmp use. close (declaration/implementation): the target calls close(req->timerfd). To prove the function does not violate the memcmp rule you must confirm that the implementation (or any macro wrapper) of close does not itself call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. free (declaration/implementation or macro/wrapper): free(req) is called. Many projects replace or wrap free with custom deallocators; the analyzer must inspect the actual free symbol (or macro) to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. abort (declaration/implementation or macro/wrapper): abort() is called on error; the analyzer must confirm the abort implementation or any project wrapper does not internally call memcmp on null-terminated strings. These symbols together cover all code paths reachable from the target function that could contain calls to memcmp; no other symbols referenced in the function (MHD_Connection, MHD_RequestTerminationCode, cls, connection, toe) are used and therefore are not required for the memcmp-specific analysis."
