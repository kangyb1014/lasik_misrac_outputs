  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C \"no language extensions\" you must inspect any types and external declarations the function uses to ensure they do not rely on compiler extensions (attributes, anonymous/unnamed/inline/bit-field/zero-length/flexible-array/packed/transparent_union extensions, non\u2011standard calling conventions, macros that expand to GCC/Clang attributes, etc.).\n\n- struct Request (full definition): The code dereferences *req_cls to obtain a struct Request and accesses req->timerfd. You must inspect the struct definition to ensure it does not use language extensions (anonymous/unnamed structs/unions, GCC attributes, zero-length or flexible-array members, bit-field extensions, packed/aligned attributes, etc.) and to confirm the type of timerfd (signedness/width) so the comparison with -1 is standard.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): The function declares a pointer to this type. Although not accessed, its definition could include language extensions (anonymous unions/structs, attributes, compiler-specific extensions) that would violate the rule, so the full definition must be checked.\n\n- enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode (full definition): The function takes this enum type as a parameter. The enum definition must be checked for any non\u2011standard extensions (explicit sized enums, compiler-specific attributes, nonportable values) that constitute language extensions.\n\n- int close(int) (declaration/prototype): The call to close must be resolved to a standard prototype. If close is missing a prototype or is declared with compiler-specific attributes or nonstandard signature, that may indicate use of language extensions. Knowing the exact declaration is necessary to detect such extensions and to verify the call is standard.\n\n- void free(void *) (declaration/prototype): As with close, the free declaration must be inspected for nonstandard macros/attributes or nonstandard signatures.\n\n- void abort(void) (declaration/prototype): The abort declaration (or macro) must be checked for attributes or compiler-specific extensions (e.g., noreturn attributes implemented as extensions) or for nonstandard macro redefinitions.\n\nNote: When checking each of the above, also inspect any macros, typedefs, or attributes used in their declarations (e.g., macros that expand to __attribute__ or compiler-specific keywords), since those are common sources of language extensions."
