  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function, pointer and enum parameters, void-pointer usage, standard library calls (abort, free) and a POSIX close() call. None of the following compiler-specific or language-extension features are present and therefore do not require investigation: no __attribute__ or __attribute__ ((__...)), no __asm__ / asm, no typeof, no statement-expressions ({ ... }) as an expression, no nested functions, no labels-as-values (&&label), no GCC/Clang builtins (__builtin_*), no __extension__ token, no extended integer types, no compiler-specific pragmas, and no use of compiler-specific keywords or inline assembly. The implicit conversion from void* (result of *req_cls) to struct Request* is standard in C (not a language extension). The use of close() is a POSIX API call, not a compiler language extension. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
