  "explanation": "For determining whether the function modifies any of its parameters (MISRA rule):\n\n- struct Request: Needed to know the type/layout of *req (in particular the type of req->timerfd). This shows whether req was obtained by dereferencing the pointer parameter and whether accesses are reads of members (allowed) vs. implicit pointer modification.\n\n- int close(int fd): The prototype shows close takes the file descriptor by value (int). That confirms calling close(req->timerfd) does not modify any pointer parameter itself (it only operates on the fd value).\n\n- void free(void *ptr): The prototype shows free takes a pointer by value and does not modify the pointer parameter variables in the caller. It does, however, deallocate the object pointed to; knowing this lets you judge that only the pointee is affected (which MISRA allows) and that the pointer parameter variable req_cls is not assigned to or modified.\n\n- void abort(void): Include to confirm abort() is a non-modifying, control-flow affecting call (it does not modify parameters).\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: Provide the definition to verify that the 'connection' parameter is not being modified (it is only cast to void here) and to rule out hidden side effects tied to its type.\n\n- enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode: Provide the definition to verify that the 'toe' parameter is not modified (it is only cast to void) and to rule out hidden side effects.\n\nThese symbols collectively let an analyzer confirm that the function only dereferences req_cls to obtain req, does not assign to any of the function parameter variables (cls, connection, req_cls, toe), and only modifies/deallocates the object pointed to by the pointer (req), which is permitted by the MISRA rule."
