  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the casts to void for unused parameters ((void) cls; (void) connection; (void) toe;) are just suppression of unused-variable warnings and do not affect pointee qualification. The local use of req (checking req->timerfd and calling close) and the subsequent free(req) indicate the object is intentionally released via a non-const pointer, so the local pointer must not be const-qualified; these lines therefore are not candidates for adding const qualification. Code handling the integer timerfd and the abort() call involve no pointer-to-object qualifications. Thus only the pointer-typed parameters and the dereference that obtains the Request pointer are relevant to whether pointees could be const-qualified."
