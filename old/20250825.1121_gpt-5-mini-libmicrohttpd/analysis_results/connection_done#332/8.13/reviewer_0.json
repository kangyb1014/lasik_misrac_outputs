Specifically, both 'cls' and 'connection' are declared as void * and struct MHD_Connection * respectively but are only used as read/unused ((void) cls; (void) connection;) and never modified \u2014 they should be declared as const void *cls and const struct MHD_Connection *connection. (The req_cls parameter is a pointer-to-pointer whose pointed-to object is freed, so it legitimately remains non-const.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function connection_done:\nenum MHD_RequestTerminationCode\n{\n\n  /**\n   * We finished sending the response.\n   * @ingroup request\n   */\n  MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_COMPLETED_OK = 0,\n\n  /**\n   * Error handling the connection (resources\n   * exhausted, application error accepting request,\n   * decrypt error (for HTTPS), connection died when\n   * sending the response etc.)\n   * @ingroup request\n   */\n  MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_WITH_ERROR = 1,\n\n  /**\n   * No activity on the connection for the number\n   * of seconds specified using\n   * #MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT.\n   * @ingroup request\n   */\n  MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_TIMEOUT_REACHED = 2,\n\n  /**\n   * We had to close the session since MHD was being\n   * shut down.\n   * @ingroup request\n   */\n  MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_DAEMON_SHUTDOWN = 3,\n\n  /**\n   * We tried to read additional data, but the connection became broken or\n   * the other side hard closed the connection.\n   * This error is similar to #MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_WITH_ERROR, but\n   * specific to the case where the connection died before request completely\n   * received.\n   * @ingroup request\n   */\n  MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_READ_ERROR = 4,\n\n  /**\n   * The client terminated the connection by closing the socket\n   * for writing (TCP half-closed) while still sending request.\n   * @ingroup request\n   */\n  MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_CLIENT_ABORT = 5\n\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_Connection\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types where possible, but you cannot arbitrarily change the parameter types of a function that must match an external API/callback prototype (here the MHD callback signature). Declaring cls or connection as const would change the function type and break the required callback signature. The req_cls parameter is correctly non-const because the function operates on/frees the object it points to. Thus, given the function must match the external library\u2019s prototype, there is no actionable MISRA 8.13 violation in this code snippet."
