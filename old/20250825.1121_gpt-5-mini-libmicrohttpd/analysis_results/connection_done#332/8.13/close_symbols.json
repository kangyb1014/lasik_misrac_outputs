  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for the MISRA 'pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible' analysis:\n\n- struct Request (full definition): To decide if the pointer 'req' could/should point to a const-qualified object we must know the concrete type and its members, whether any members are mutable, and whether any members are pointer types themselves. The definition also shows whether the object is intended to be owned and modified (or freed) by callbacks.\n\n- functions that allocate/initialize and assign a struct Request * into *req_cls: You must see the allocation site(s) and the code that stores the pointer in *req_cls to determine ownership and lifetime semantics. If the code that creates and assigns *req_cls expects subsequent callbacks to mutate or free the pointed object, the pointer must not be const. Conversely, if it is only read, const qualification could be possible.\n\n- other callbacks/translation-units that read from or write to *req_cls: The decision to add const depends on all uses of the pointed object. If any other callback writes through *req_cls (mutates fields, resets the pointer, frees it, etc.), the pointer cannot be const. We need those symbols/usages to know global usage patterns.\n\n- prototype/typedef of the MHD callback that declares the req_cls parameter: The library API signature and its documented semantics (is con_cls/req_cls an opaque state pointer passed between callbacks, who owns it, who may modify it?) determine whether the parameter is intended to be mutable. The typedef/declaration and documentation indicate whether const is compatible with the API.\n\n- prototype of free (void free(void *)): free takes a void * (non-const). If the object is freed here, it cannot be declared const-qualified (because passing a const-qualified object to free would violate type compatibility). The free prototype is needed to justify that freeing requires a non-const pointer.\n\n- prototype of close (int close(int)): While close operates on an int (timerfd), its prototype helps confirm that req->timerfd is an integer fd member (not a pointer) and that operations on it do not affect pointer constness of req itself. It helps rule out need for const qualification changes driven by file-descriptor semantics.\n\n- definition of enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode: Included to fully understand the callback signature and whether toe or other params imply any const expectations on req_cls via API semantics (mostly for completeness of API-side intent).\n\n- definition of struct MHD_Connection: Included because it is part of the callback prototype; its definition / usage could reveal whether the API commonly treats the per-connection state (con_cls/req_cls) as mutable or immutable.\n\nIn short: to determine whether req (and the req_cls parameter) could be const-qualified we must know the full type of struct Request, who allocates/frees/ mutates it across callbacks, and the API ownership/semantics. We also need the prototypes of free/close to understand whether the code performs operations (free) that require a non-const pointer."
