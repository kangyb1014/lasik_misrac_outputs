  "scenario": "Not violated. The dereferenced pointer is used to close a descriptor and free the object (req->timerfd and free(req)), so the pointed-to struct must be modifiable; therefore making it const would be incorrect. Rule 8.13 recommends const when possible, but here const qualification is not possible because the object is modified/freed. If the code did not modify the object, then the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (e.g. const struct Request *), but that is not the case here."
