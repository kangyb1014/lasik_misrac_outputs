  "explanation": "No recursive calls are present in this fragment. The function connection_done does not call itself, and there are no calls to other user-defined functions that could plausibly call back into connection_done: only standard/library calls are made (close, abort, free). There are also no function pointers, callbacks, or indirect call sites in this code that could introduce indirect recursion. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 17.2."
