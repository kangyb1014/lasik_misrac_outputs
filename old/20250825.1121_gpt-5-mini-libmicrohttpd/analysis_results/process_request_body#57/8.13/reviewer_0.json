  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The scenario confuses two things: (a) the target function process_request_body does not itself declare header_name/header_value \u2013 the code that uses those variables is transmit_error_response_len, and (b) those pointers are not purely immutable in the full ownership/usage sense.\n\ntransmit_error_response_len either frees header_name/header_value itself (on some error paths) or passes them to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ and then does not free them. That indicates an ownership transfer to the response object (or at least a possibility of later deallocation/modification by the callee). Because the pointers can be freed (and are handed to a function that likely stores / later frees or otherwise treats them as mutable buffers), they cannot safely be declared const char * without breaking the ownership API (and without having to cast away const to call free). In other words the pointers are not merely read-only buffers: their lifetime/ownership semantics require non-const types. \n\nTherefore Rule 8.13 (prefer const-qualified pointees when possible) does not mandate changing these parameters to const in this context, and the agent A report is incorrect unless the callee MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ is proven to accept const and never modifies/frees the pointers. Given the observed frees and ownership transfer, marking them const would be wrong."
