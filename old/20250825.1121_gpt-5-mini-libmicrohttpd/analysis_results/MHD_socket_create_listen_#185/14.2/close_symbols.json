Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check MISRA \"for loop well-formed\" for MHD_socket_create_listen_:\n\n- MHD_socket_noninheritable_\n  - Called directly from the target function. Although the target contains no for loop textually, any called function could contain for loops; the MISRA check must consider behaviour of functions invoked from within loop bodies or the function itself. We need the definition/body to see if it contains for loops or modifies loop counters used elsewhere.\n\n- MHD_socket_nosignal_\n  - Called (or macro-expanded) inside an if-condition. It may be a function or macro; its definition could contain for loops or side effects that affect analysis of loop well-formedness when/if it is used inside a for statement in this function or in inline expansions.\n\n- MHD_socket_get_error_\n  - Called to obtain an error code before error handling. Its implementation could contain for loops or modify global/state used as loop counters/flags; include to ensure no hidden for loops or side effects that would affect conformity.\n\n- MHD_socket_close_\n  - Called during error handling. Must inspect its body in case it contains for loops or modifies objects that could be loop counters or control flags (MISRA forbids modification of loop counter in loop body).\n\n- MHD_socket_fset_error_\n  - Called to set error state; include to check for any looping constructs or side effects relevant to loop-counter/flag use.\n\n- socket\n  - The socket identifier may be a macro wrapper around system calls. A macro could expand to code containing loops; include its definition to rule out hidden for loops or side effects that would invalidate MISRA checks.\n\n- WSASocketW\n  - Platform-specific socket-creation function used under a compile branch. Its implementation (or macro wrapper) must be checked for for-loops or side effects affecting loop counters/flags.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET\n  - Used in comparisons and returns; may be a macro. If it expands into an expression with side effects or contains constructs that include loops (rare but possible via macros), we must inspect it.\n\n- SOCK_CLOEXEC_OR_ZERO\n  - Used in expressions to set cloexec_set. This is likely a macro/constant; if it is a complex macro it could expand to code that includes loops or side effects. We need its definition to rule that out.\n\n- SOCK_NOSIGPIPE_OR_ZERO\n  - Same rationale as SOCK_CLOEXEC_OR_ZERO: used in expressions and may be a macro; include to ensure no hidden looping constructs or side effects.\n\n- SOCK_CLOEXEC\n  - Compile-time flag/macro used in socket call. If defined as macro with side-effects or expansions, its definition must be checked.\n\n- SOCK_NOSIGPIPE\n  - Same as SOCK_CLOEXEC: include to ensure no unexpected macro expansions with loops.\n\n- MSG_NOSIGNAL_OR_ZERO\n  - Used in condition checking for alternate ways to suppress SIGPIPE. If this macro expands to code (rather than a simple constant), it could contain loops/side effects and must be inspected.\n\nSummary: to determine whether MHD_socket_create_listen_ violates the MISRA requirement about well-formed for loops you must confirm that neither the function body nor any invoked/called/macro-expanded symbols contain for loops or hidden modifications of loop counters/flags. The listed symbols are all functions/macros used by the target function whose definitions might contain for loops or side effects relevant to the MISRA rule and therefore must be available for analysis."
