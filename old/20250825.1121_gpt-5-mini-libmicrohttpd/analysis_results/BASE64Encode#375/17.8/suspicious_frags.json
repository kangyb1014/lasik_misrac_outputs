  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters are: (const void *in, size_t len, char **output). The code does not assign to or reassign any of these parameter variables: 'in' is only read and immediately assigned to a local const char *data (so the parameter itself is not changed), 'len' is only read (never assigned), and 'output' is never reassigned. The only write involving 'output' is '*output = opt;', which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter (the pointee) \u2014 this is explicitly permitted by Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no fragments that violate or appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
