  "explanation": "ssize_t \u2014 This function returns ssize_t. ssize_t is not part of ISO C (it is a POSIX / platform-specific type on many systems). To decide whether its use constitutes a language/platform extension (and thus a MISRA violation under the \"language extensions\" rule) the analyzer must know how ssize_t is provided/defined on the target build (header, typedef, or compiler extension).\n\nsize_t \u2014 The function accepts/uses size_t. size_t is standard in ISO C, but the analyzer should confirm the actual typedef/headers in the build environment to ensure no nonstandard replacement or extension is being used.\n\nmalloc \u2014 The function calls malloc. malloc is part of the C standard library, but some toolchains provide nonstandard variants or macros. The analyzer must know the declaration/prototype (header providing it) to verify no compiler-specific extension or nonstandard replacement is being invoked.\n\nNULL \u2014 The function uses NULL when checking malloc result. NULL is a macro whose definition can be implementation specific; the analyzer should confirm it is the standard definition and not a compiler extension.\n\nvoid* to object-pointer implicit conversion \u2014 The code assigns the input void pointer to a const char * (const char *data = in;) and assigns malloc(void*) result to char * without an explicit cast. The rules for implicit conversions between void* and other object pointer types differ between C and some compiler modes (and between C and C++). To decide whether this is using a language extension (or relies on a nonstandard compiler behavior), the analyzer must know the target language mode and compiler rules for implicit void* conversions.\n\nNote: Other symbols used in the function (literal string concatenation, local FILLCHAR, basic arithmetic, casts) are standard C constructs. The listed symbols are the ones that could plausibly come from or rely on platform/compiler-specific extensions and therefore must be inspected to determine compliance with the MISRA rule about language extensions."
