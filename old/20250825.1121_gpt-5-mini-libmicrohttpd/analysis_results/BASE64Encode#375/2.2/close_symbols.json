Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n- ws_get_accept_value: This is the direct caller of BASE64Encode per the call graph. To determine whether code inside BASE64Encode is actually executed (vs. effectively dead) we must inspect how ws_get_accept_value calls it \u2014 what pointer and length (len) are passed, whether the return value is checked/used, and whether the produced output buffer is used. These determine which branches in BASE64Encode are reachable and whether removing parts of the function would change program behaviour.\n\n- ahc_cb: This is the caller of ws_get_accept_value. To decide if BASE64Encode is dead at project level we must know whether the chain ahc_cb -> ws_get_accept_value -> BASE64Encode is reachable at runtime. If ahc_cb is never invoked, the whole chain could be dead; conversely, if ahc_cb is the event handler that is always invoked, the code is live.\n\n- SHA1Reset, SHA1Input, SHA1Result: These are invoked by ws_get_accept_value before calling BASE64Encode. SHA1Result produces the SHA-1 digest that is very likely the data passed into BASE64Encode. We need to inspect these symbols to determine the digest length and format actually passed to BASE64Encode, which fixes possible len values and therefore which branches/padding cases in BASE64Encode are ever exercised.\n\n- (any SHA1 digest-size constant used by ws_get_accept_value, e.g. SHA1_DIGEST_LENGTH): If ws_get_accept_value uses a compile-time constant for the SHA-1 output size, that constant directly determines the len argument passed to BASE64Encode (e.g. always 20). Knowing this lets you decide whether some conditional branches in the encoder (padding branches, increments of i) are dead because the input length can never take values that exercise them.\n\n- malloc: BASE64Encode calls malloc to allocate the output buffer and has an early return path on allocation failure (return -1). To determine whether that path or subsequent uses of the allocated buffer are meaningful (i.e. whether removing the allocation or the error branch would change behaviour), you must inspect malloc semantics in the project context and how callers react to a -1 return or to the produced output pointer.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst (a) determine whether BASE64Encode is reachable from program entry points, (b) determine the concrete values of len/data passed in typical/possible executions (so you can tell whether specific branches are ever executed), and (c) determine whether allocation/error handling paths affect program behaviour (so you can decide if any executed operations are truly dead code)."
