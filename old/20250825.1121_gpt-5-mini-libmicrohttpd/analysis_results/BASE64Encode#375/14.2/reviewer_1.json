First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of BASE64Encode.\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nBASE64Encode (const void *in, size_t len, char **output)\n{\n#define FILLCHAR '='\n  const char *cvt = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n                    \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n                    \"0123456789+/\";\n  const char *data = in;\n  char *opt;\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t i;\n  char c;\n  ret = 0;\n\n  opt = malloc (2 + (len * 4 / 3) + 8);\n  if (NULL == opt)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n  for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)\n  {\n    c = (data[i] >> 2) & 0x3F;\n    opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    c = (data[i] << 4) & 0x3F;\n    if (++i < len)\n    {\n      c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 4) & 0x0F));\n    }\n    opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    if (i < len)\n    {\n      c = (char) (c | ((data[i] << 2) & 0x3F));\n      if (++i < len)\n      {\n        c = (char) (c | ((data[i] >> 6) & 0x03));\n      }\n      opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      ++i;\n      opt[ret++] = FILLCHAR;\n    }\n    if (i < len)\n    {\n      c = data[i] & 0x3F;\n      opt[ret++] = cvt[(int) c];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      opt[ret++] = FILLCHAR;\n    }\n  }\n  *output = opt;\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false).

MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires that there be only one loop counter and that it shall not be modified in the for-loop body (clauses 3/4). Therefore the code violates Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function BASE64Encode:\nsize_t i\n...\nsize_t len\n...\nconst char *data = in\n...\nconst void *in\n...\nchar c\n...\nenum MHD_Result ret\n...\nchar *opt\n...\n#define FILLCHAR '='\n...\nconst char *cvt = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n                    \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n                    \"0123456789+/\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The for statement is written as for (i = 0; i < len; ++i) (i is the loop counter) but the loop body contains several ++i and a ++i in an else branch. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires that the loop counter shall not be modified in the for-loop body (and there shall be only one loop counter). Modifying i inside the loop body therefore violates Rule 14.2."
