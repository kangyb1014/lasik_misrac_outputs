The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "i: the loop counter named in the for header \u2014 you must confirm it is the single loop counter and determine whether it is modified in the loop body (MISRA forbids modifying the loop counter in the body).\nlen: the loop bound used in the second clause (i < len) \u2014 you must confirm len has no persistent side\u2011effects and is not modified anywhere in the loop body.\ndata: the array being indexed by i in the body \u2014 required to check whether accesses or aliasing could affect the loop counter or whether indexing constitutes modification of objects used in the second clause.\nin: the original input pointer parameter (source of data) \u2014 to establish it is not an alias to i or some object that could modify i; helps confirm no external side effects affect the loop counter.\nc: local temporary used to compute indices into cvt \u2014 included to show other local modifications in the body and to ensure they are not loop counters or objects used in the second clause.\nret and opt: local variables written inside the loop body (ret used as write index) \u2014 needed to verify that the second or third clause of the for does not depend on or modify these objects (MISRA forbids using objects modified in the body in the second clause).\nFILLCHAR and cvt: constants/macros used in the body \u2014 included to show there are no function calls in the loop body that could have side effects on the loop counter.\nmalloc: external function called before the loop \u2014 include for completeness to show there are no function calls inside the loop body that could modify i; verify there are no hidden side effects affecting loop control.\nsize_t and ssize_t: the types of i and len/return value \u2014 needed to reason about integer semantics, wrap/overflow behaviour, and whether the loop counter is an integer object as required by the MISRA clause.\n++ (increments of i in the loop header and body): explicit mention of all ++ uses on i \u2014 required to identify that i is incremented both in the for third clause and multiple times inside the loop body (this is the key evidence for a MISRA violation: the loop counter is modified in the loop body)."
