  "explanation": "- ws_get_accept_value: caller of BASE64Encode. You must inspect this function to see how the returned base64 buffer is used (is it null-terminated, is it passed to a comparison function, are lengths provided to comparisons). The MISRA rule violation depends on whether a memcmp (or other raw comparison) is ever applied to a null-terminated string produced or consumed here.\n\n- SHA1Reset, SHA1Input, SHA1Result: these are callees of ws_get_accept_value. SHA1Result produces the raw digest that is base64-encoded; you need to know the digest length/format and how the digest is handed to BASE64Encode so you can determine whether the base64 result is intended/treated as a C string (null-terminated) by the caller.\n\n- memcmp: this is the exact Standard Library function cited by the MISRA rule. You must locate any uses of memcmp (in ws_get_accept_value or nearby code) and inspect the arguments (pointers and lengths) to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (which would violate the rule).\n\n- strcmp, strncmp: include these string-comparison functions because the caller might use them instead of memcmp (or the code may mix/use several comparison APIs). Checking their usage helps determine whether comparisons are performed on null-terminated strings and whether memcmp-like raw comparisons are being used improperly.\n\n- malloc: used by BASE64Encode to allocate the output buffer. You must verify allocation size and whether BASE64Encode (or its callers) append a terminating '\\0'. If BASE64Encode does not null-terminate the buffer (it does not in the shown code), but the caller uses memcmp/strcmp treating it as a C string, that is relevant to the MISRA check."
