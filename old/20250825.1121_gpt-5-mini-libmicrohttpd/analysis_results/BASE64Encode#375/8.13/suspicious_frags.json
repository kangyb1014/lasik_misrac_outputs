  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: 'in' is declared as const void * (the pointee is const-qualified), and both 'cvt' and 'data' are declared as const char * and are only used for read access. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-to-object assignments in the function. The listed fragments are the only places where a pointer points to a non-const-qualified type (or where a pointer-to-pointer is used) and thus merit review for whether the pointed-to type should be const-qualified under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
