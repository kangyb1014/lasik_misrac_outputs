  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Agent A points to uses of mhd_assert which, in the provided build, is defined as a no-op macro (#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)). That does cause the assertion invocations to expand to a null statement, and thus they do not generate runtime behaviour in that configuration. However, this pattern is an intentionally conditional/annotation mechanism (assertions that can be enabled or disabled by changing the macro). MISRA Rule 2.2 is concerned with permanent dead code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour; an assertion macro that is a no-op in one build but can be redefined to perform checking in another build is not \u201cdead\u201d in the sense the rule intends, and industry practice (and MISRA interpretation) treats such assertion macros as annotations rather than accidental dead code. Also note agent A refers to the assertion in MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (mhd_assert(c->write_buffer_send_offset <= new_buf_size)); this is outside MHD_pool_try_alloc but the same reasoning applies.\n\nIf you take a strictly literal reading of Rule 2.2 and treat any source-level statement that does nothing in the shipped build as dead, then the no-op assertions would trip that rule; but that is not how MISRA compliance is normally assessed \u2014 assertions implemented as configurable macros that expand to nothing in production are an accepted idiom and not considered a violation of Rule 2.2. Therefore the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct for this code as presented."
