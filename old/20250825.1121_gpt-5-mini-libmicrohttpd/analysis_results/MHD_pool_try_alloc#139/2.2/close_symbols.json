  "explanation": "To determine whether any statements in MHD_pool_try_alloc are dead (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour) we need the definitions/semantics of the following symbols:\n\n- struct MemoryPool\n  Reason: The function reads and updates pool->end, pool->pos, pool->size and indexes pool->memory. The types, ranges, initialisation rules and invariants (e.g. how end/pos/size are set) are required to determine whether branches (e.g. asize > pool->end - pool->pos) can ever be taken and whether writes (pool->end -= asize) have observable effect.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN\n  Reason: Used in assertions and to test alignment invariants. Its definition determines whether pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos) is always true and whether some assert checks are provably redundant.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE\n  Reason: Computes asize from size. Its exact behaviour (including overflow handling) decides whether the rare branch (asize == 0 && size != 0) is reachable; thus whether that block is dead.\n\n- ALIGNMENT and RED_ZONE\n  Reason: Likely used by the ROUND_* macros. Their values affect the alignment/rounding behaviour and therefore reachability of branches and arithmetic results used by the function.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  Reason: The function calls mhd_assert three times. To judge dead code you must know whether mhd_assert has side-effects, is compiled out in some builds (becomes a no-op), or alters control flow (e.g. aborts). That affects whether those calls (and surrounding checks) are operational code or removable.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY\n  Reason: Called before return; often a sanitizer/no-op macro. Knowing whether it has observable side-effects is necessary to decide if that call (and any memory accesses needed for it) is dead.\n\n- SIZE_MAX\n  Reason: Used as a sentinel return value in two branches. Its value/definition and any related semantics (overflow handling of size arithmetic) are needed to decide reachability of the branches that set *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_\n  Reason: The static call graph shows this routine calls MHD_pool_try_alloc. Inspecting the caller (and how it passes pool, size and how it uses required_bytes and return value) is required to assess whether MHD_pool_try_alloc is actually exercised at runtime and whether certain assignments (e.g. required_bytes = 0 or pool->end modification) have observable effects \u2014 essential to determine dead code.\n\n- MHD_pool_allocate and MHD_pool_reallocate\n  Reason: These functions (invoked by MHD_connection_alloc_memory_) are responsible for creating/adjusting MemoryPool instances. Their behaviour (how they initialize end/pos/size and when they call try_alloc vs full allocate/reallocate) is necessary to reason about which branches in try_alloc can occur and whether the try_alloc code is reachable or whether it could be removed without changing behaviour.\n\nTogether these symbols provide the data layout, macro arithmetic, caller/callee context and side-effect semantics needed to decide whether any executed operations in MHD_pool_try_alloc are in fact dead code."
