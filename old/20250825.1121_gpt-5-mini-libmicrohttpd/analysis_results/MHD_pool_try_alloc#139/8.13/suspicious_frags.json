  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. All pointer usages in this function require non-const qualification for legitimate reasons:\n- Parameter 'struct MemoryPool *pool' is modified (pool->end is changed), so it cannot be a pointer-to-const.\n- Parameter 'size_t *required_bytes' is an output parameter that is written in several branches, so it cannot be a pointer-to-const.\n- The local 'void *ret' is returned as a pointer to writable memory obtained from pool->memory; the buffer is intended for use as mutable storage, so it must be non-const. The call to _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(ret, size) also implies writable memory.\n- There are no other pointer variables or pointer-to-object expressions in this function that are only read and could be changed to point-to-const.\nGiven the above, Rule 8.13 (prefer const-qualified pointee types where possible) does not indicate any change for this function: each pointer currently points to a non-const object because the code either modifies the pointee or returns writable memory. Therefore no fragments need further investigation for this rule."
