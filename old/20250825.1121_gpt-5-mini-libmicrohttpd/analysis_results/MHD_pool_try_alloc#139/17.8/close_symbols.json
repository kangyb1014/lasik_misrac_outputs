  "explanation": "To check MISRA C rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d we must ensure that the code does not assign to any of the parameter objects themselves (pool, size, required_bytes). The following symbols are needed and why:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (full definition): The function writes into fields of *pool (pool->end -= asize; reads pool->pos, pool->end, pool->size, pool->memory). We must confirm these are members of the object referred to by the pointer (allowed to be modified) and not implemented in ways that would rebind the parameter 'pool' itself (e.g., via weird macros or overloaded identifiers). Also the type of memory[] (array vs pointer) clarifies that ret computation takes an address into the pool storage rather than changing the parameter.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN (macro or function definition): This macro/function is called with expressions that include parameter-derived values (pool->pos, pool->end - pool->pos). We must verify it has no side effects that could modify the parameter variables (for example, expansion that assigns to its argument) or otherwise rebind parameters.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (macro or function definition): Called with the parameter 'size'. We must ensure it does not modify 'size' (or any other parameter) through side effects in its expansion/implementation.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function definition): Called with expressions involving pool fields. Typical asserts do not modify their arguments, but some project-specific assert macros could have side effects; we need its definition to be sure it does not modify parameters.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (macro or function definition): Called with ret and size. We must confirm it does not modify the local parameter variable 'size' or reassign pointer parameters; ensure it only operates on the memory region and has no side effects that would violate the rule.\n\n- SIZE_MAX (macro/constant definition): Although a constant, include its definition to confirm it is a simple constant (no side effects) and to understand the intent of assignments to *required_bytes. This helps ensure that only the pointed-to object (*required_bytes) is being modified, not the pointer parameter itself.\n\nWith these definitions we can verify that all writes observed in the function modify objects referred to by pointer parameters (allowed) and that none of the macros/functions expand or behave in a way that reassigns the pointer parameters themselves (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
