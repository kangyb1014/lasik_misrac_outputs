  "explanation": "For MISRA C unreachable-code analysis you must be able to prove which branches can ever be taken. The target function's control flow depends on macro expansions, field types and numeric limits; therefore the following symbols are required:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (definition: types and names of fields end, pos, size, memory)\n  - Needed to know the exact types (e.g. are end/pos/size size_t or signed), and any documented invariants on these fields. The branch conditions use pool->end - pool->pos and comparisons to pool->end; whether those expressions can wrap or be negative (and thus make branches reachable/unreachable) depends on the field types and intended invariants.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN (macro/function)\n  - The code assumes properties of ROUND_TO_ALIGN (used in asserts and comparisons). To determine if any branch is impossible you must know how ROUND_TO_ALIGN maps inputs to outputs (e.g. monotonicity, whether it can return 0 for positive inputs, relation to its argument).\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (macro/function)\n  - asize is computed by this macro. Proving whether the (0 == asize && 0 != size) branch is reachable requires the exact expansion/semantics (how it rounds, whether it adds a red zone that can overflow and wrap to 0 for nonzero size).\n\n- SIZE_MAX (macro)\n  - This constant appears in overflow-related comparisons and assignments. Knowing its value (and that size_t uses modulo arithmetic up to SIZE_MAX) is needed to reason about wrap/overflow behavior that makes branches reachable.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function)\n  - The function contains multiple asserts that express invariants (e.g. pool->end >= pool->pos, pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos)). Whether these are enforceable guarantees for reachability analysis depends on mhd_assert's definition: if it aborts at runtime only in debug builds vs expands to nothing (NOP) in production, you cannot assume the asserted conditions for proving unreachable code unless asserts are part of the contract. You must know its semantics to decide if branches guarded only by assertions are provably unreachable.\n\n- size_t (type semantics / width)\n  - size_t is used for size and arithmetic; its unsigned modulo behaviour, width (so when ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE can overflow to zero), and comparison semantics are necessary to reason about wrap-around and whether expressions like asize > pool->end - pool->pos can ever be true/false.\n\nNote: _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY and the function callers are not required to determine local unreachable branches in this function (they do not affect control flow decisions here)."
