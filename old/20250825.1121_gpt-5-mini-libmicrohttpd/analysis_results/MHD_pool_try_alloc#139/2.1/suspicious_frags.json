  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function are provably unreachable. Rationale for not selecting any fragments for investigation:\n\n- The first conditional (if ((0 == asize) && (0 != size))) is intended to catch an overflow/wraparound of size_t when ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(size) wraps to 0; this is a legitimate, if unlikely, runtime situation and therefore reachable.\n\n- The outer allocation-failure branch (if (asize > pool->end - pool->pos)) is reachable when the requested aligned size exceeds the remaining pool space.\n\n- The nested branch inside that failure case (if (asize <= pool->end) ... else ...) covers two distinct reachable sub-cases: when the request would fit into the whole pool buffer (but not into the remaining chunk because pool->pos > 0), and when the request is larger than the entire pool. Both are possible depending on pool->pos and asize.\n\n- The normal allocation path (setting *required_bytes = 0; computing ret; decrementing pool->end; calling _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY; return ret;) is reachable when asize <= pool->end - pool->pos.\n\n- The mhd_assert macros are only assertions/checks; depending on their definition they may be runtime checks or no-ops in production, but they do not introduce unreachable code in the function as written.\n\n- There is no code after the final return that would be unreachable.\n\nGiven the above, no fragment is clearly unreachable without additional information (e.g., definitions of the ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE macro or invariants that would make one branch impossible). If such invariants or macro definitions are provided that prove a condition always true or false, specific branches could then be flagged as unreachable and should be re-evaluated."
