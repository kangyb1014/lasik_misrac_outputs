  "explanation": "You must know the following symbols to determine whether any string.h functions can access beyond the referenced objects:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (full definition): The function computes ret = &pool->memory[pool->end - asize] and updates pool->end. To check pointer arithmetic and bounds you need the exact declaration of pool->memory (element type and declared length) and the semantics/units of pool->end, pool->pos and pool->size (are they byte offsets, indexes, etc.). This is essential to prove ret and any subsequent byte operations stay within memory[].\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN (macro/function): asize computation and several assertions rely on this macro. Its definition shows the alignment granularity and arithmetic used; a buggy rounding macro could cause asize to be larger than assumed or wrap, leading to out-of-bounds accesses if later used by string.h functions.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (macro/function): This produces asize from the requested size and includes any red-zone padding. You must see how the red zone is added and whether the macro can overflow or produce a value that allows later memory touches beyond the allocated slot.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (macro/function): This is the only call in the function that could hide uses of string.h functions (e.g., it could wrap memset, memmove, or other standard functions). You must inspect its definition to know whether it calls any string.h functions and with which pointer/length arguments (ret and size are passed), to determine if those calls could access out-of-bounds bytes.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function): Although typically only an assertion, the exact definition is needed to ensure it has no side-effects that affect pointer/index values or that it is not implemented by functions that call string.h routines or change runtime behavior relevant to bounds.\n\n- SIZE_MAX (macro/constant): Used in overflow/limit checks. Understanding its value and the code paths that set *required_bytes = SIZE_MAX is needed to reason about potential wrap/overflow conditions that could cause subsequent string.h calls to be invoked with incorrect sizes.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst verify: how asize is computed, whether pointer arithmetic yields a pointer inside pool->memory, whether any wrapping/overflow can occur, and whether _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (or any macro used) invokes string.h functions with arguments that could exceed the allocated object bounds."
