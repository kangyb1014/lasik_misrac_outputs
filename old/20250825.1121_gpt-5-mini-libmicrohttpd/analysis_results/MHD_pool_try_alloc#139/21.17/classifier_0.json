  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment does not call any <string.h> function and the pointer arithmetic is guarded by earlier checks/asserts: asize is computed and the code returns if asize > pool->end - pool->pos, so when executed pool->end - asize >= pool->pos. The asserts also ensure pool->end <= pool->pos + pool->size, so the computed index (pool->end - asize) is within the allocated pool->memory region under the stated invariants. A violation could only occur if the pool invariants/asserts are false or pool->memory actually refers to a smaller buffer than implied (i.e. corrupted or mis-initialized pool), but that is not a direct MISRA 21.17 violation in this fragment."
