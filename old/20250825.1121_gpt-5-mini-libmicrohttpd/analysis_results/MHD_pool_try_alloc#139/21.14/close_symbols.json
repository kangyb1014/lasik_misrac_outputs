  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_pool_try_alloc violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, we must be sure the function (or any macros/functions it uses) does not call memcmp or hide string comparisons. The required symbols and reasons:\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: This macro/function is used in the function body. Macros can expand to complex expressions or call other functions; we must inspect its definition to ensure it does not call memcmp or perform string comparisons on null-terminated strings.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: Same rationale as ROUND_TO_ALIGN \u2014 it is used to compute asize and might hide calls to memcmp or string-comparison logic.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY: Called at the end of the function. Its implementation could call library routines (including memcmp) or perform operations that compare strings, so it must be examined.\n\n- mhd_assert: Assertion macro/function used multiple times. Some assert implementations can expand to logging or diagnostics that might use string comparison functions; its definition must be checked for any use of memcmp on C-strings.\n\n- struct MemoryPool: The structure definition (especially the type of memory[] and semantics of pos/end/size) is needed to ensure no hidden inline functions or accessors are used that may perform memcmp or string comparisons, and to understand whether any pointer arithmetic could invoke helper macros/functions that use memcmp.\n\n- SIZE_MAX: The constant is referenced; include it to confirm it is the standard macro and not redefined to something that triggers other code with memcmp.\n\n- memcmp: Include the standard memcmp symbol itself so the analyzer can check whether any of the above symbols (macros/functions/inline helpers) call or expand to use memcmp, and to detect any indirect usage.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst confirm there is no direct or hidden use of memcmp (particularly comparing null-terminated strings) within MHD_pool_try_alloc or in any macros/functions it invokes."
