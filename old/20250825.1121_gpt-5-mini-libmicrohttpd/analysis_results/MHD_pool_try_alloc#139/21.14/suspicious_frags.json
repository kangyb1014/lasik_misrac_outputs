  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp (directly or hidden behind macros) exists in the provided code. The function MHD_pool_try_alloc performs only integer arithmetic, pointer/index calculations, and calls to macros defined as no-ops (mhd_assert, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) and rounding macros (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE). The struct and macro definitions shown contain no string-handling operations. Therefore there are no code fragments that match MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) in the supplied code. If memcmp is used elsewhere in other source files, those files would need to be inspected, but within the provided snippets there are no candidates to investigate."
