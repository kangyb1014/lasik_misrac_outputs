  "explanation": "You need the definitions of these symbols to determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule check). For each:\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: This is a macro used to align pool->pos and other sizes. Inspecting its definition is required to see whether it uses compiler-specific extensions (e.g. GCC statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __builtin_*, __extension__, or non-standard operators).\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: Same reason as above; its expansion may contain extension constructs or rely on non-standard behavior (overflow tricks, builtins, attributes).\n\n- mhd_assert: This assertion macro may expand to compiler-specific constructs (inline assembly, __builtin_trap, __attribute__ markers, or other extensions). You must inspect its definition to determine if it uses any language extensions.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY: This symbol looks like an instrumentation/sanitizer call or macro. Its implementation may map to non-standard sanitizer APIs or compiler builtins (e.g. __asan_unpoison_memory_region) or may be defined using compiler-specific attributes or intrinsics. Confirming its definition is required.\n\n- struct MemoryPool: The struct layout (types of pos, end, size and the declaration of memory) must be inspected. In particular, the memory member could be a zero-length array (char memory[0]) which is a common GCC extension, or use flexible array member (standard C99: char memory[]). The struct may also contain alignment attributes or unnamed/anonymous unions/structs (compiler extensions). These affect whether language extensions are used.\n\n- SIZE_MAX: Although from the standard headers, SIZE_MAX must be confirmed to be the standard macro and not a project-specific non-standard definition that uses extensions or compiler intrinsics.\n\nChecking these definitions will allow you to detect any use of non-standard language features (statement expressions, typeof, zero-length arrays, compiler __attribute__ syntax, builtin intrinsics, inline asm, etc.) that would violate the MISRA prohibition on language extensions."
