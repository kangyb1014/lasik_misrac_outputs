  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Typical compiler extensions that would trigger Rule 1.2 (and that I specifically looked for) include: GCC/Clang __attribute__ annotations, __asm__ or inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }) as an expression, typeof, nested functions, binary literals or other non-standard literal forms, compiler builtins (e.g. __builtin_*), Microsoft-specific __declspec, token-pasting or concatenation tricks used as extensions, or other constructs explicitly documented as extensions by compilers. None of these appear in the function or the related macros/struct. The code uses standard C identifiers and standard library types (size_t, uint8_t, bool, SIZE_MAX) and only standard preprocessor features (macros, backslash-newline continuation). Note: identifiers or macros beginning with an underscore followed by a capital letter (e.g. _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) are reserved by the implementation, but that is a reservation of identifiers rather than a compiler language extension; it does not by itself constitute use of a documented compiler extension per Rule 1.2. Therefore there are no fragments to report for investigation under Rule 1.2."
