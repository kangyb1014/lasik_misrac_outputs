  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (conditions used by if/while/for/do-while/switch-like constructs). I have listed every controlling construct present in the function: all if statements and the mhd_assert calls (which typically expand to a conditional check in some builds). Other lines in the function (assignments, arithmetic expressions, pointer arithmetic, return statements, function-like calls such as ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE and _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements in this function beyond the listed conditionals, so no additional controlling expressions exist to inspect."
