  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in MHD_pool_try_alloc is invariant you must know how the expressions' operands are computed and whether any assertion macros inject control flow.  Specifically:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (definition): the code tests/uses pool->pos, pool->end and pool->size and computes pool->end - pool->pos and accesses pool->memory. You must see the field types and any invariants/aliases to know whether these members are compile-time constants or otherwise invariant in this context.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN (macro/function): asserts and the second mhd_assert use ROUND_TO_ALIGN on pool->pos and pool->end - pool->pos; ROUND_TO_ALIGN's definition determines whether these expressions can be invariant (for example if it reduces every input to a constant) and thus whether the controlling expressions are constant.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (macro/function): this computes asize from size. The if ((0 == asize) && (0 != size)) controlling expression depends on asize; you must inspect this macro to ensure asize is actually a function of size (not a constant) and to understand wrap/overflow behavior near SIZE_MAX.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function/definition): mhd_assert may expand to an if(...) or be a no-op. If it expands to control-flow (e.g. if (!expr) abort()) that introduces controlling expressions whose invariance must be checked against MISRA. Also, if it is compiled out, some apparent checks in the function vanish \u2014 affecting whether remaining controlling expressions are invariant.\n\n- SIZE_MAX (macro, from limits.h): used in comparisons/assignments in the conditionals; knowing its value and semantics (and whether any custom redefinition exists) is necessary to reason about the branch conditions becoming constant.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (macro/function/definition): although not a controlling expression here, its definition could contain control constructs (e.g. if/loop) when expanded as a macro; to be safe the definition should be inspected to ensure no hidden invariant controlling expressions are introduced when analyzing MISRA compliance."
