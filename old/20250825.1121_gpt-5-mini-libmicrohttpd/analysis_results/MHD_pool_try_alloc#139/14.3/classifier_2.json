  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The expression pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN(pool->pos) is not an invariant constant \u2014 it depends on the runtime value of pool->pos (it tests alignment). Also Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions of control statements (if/while/for/do/switch); here the expression is an argument to the mhd_assert macro rather than a language-level controlling expression. Only if ROUND_TO_ALIGN were somehow a compile-time constant making the test always true/false would a violation occur, which is not the case in the shown code."
