  "explanation": "mhd_assert: In the source it is used (mhd_assert(...)). mhd_assert may be a macro that expands to a call (for example to an assertion failure handler) or to inline code; to prove absence of indirect recursion we must inspect its definition to ensure it does not call test_header (directly or via other functions).\n\nmemcmp: The code calls memcmp(). Although normally a standard library function, some projects replace/wrap it (or it may call other helpers). To rule out indirect recursion we must see the actual memcmp implementation/wrapper used in this build to ensure it cannot call back into test_header.\n\nstruct test_header_param: test_header casts the cls parameter to this struct and reads param->connection. The struct definition must be inspected to ensure it contains no function pointers (or other fields) that could cause a call back into test_header when accessed.\n\nstruct MHD_Connection: The code reads connection->rq.headers_received. The MHD_Connection definition (and the type of its rq field) must be inspected for embedded function pointers or callbacks that could be invoked (directly or indirectly) and lead to test_header.\n\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop walks a linked list of these nodes (pos->next) and accesses pos->header/pos->value. The node type must be checked for function pointers or side\u2011effecting accessors that could call test_header.\n\n(These symbols together let an analyser determine whether any called function or any accessed data structure can cause a direct or indirect invocation of test_header, which is required to assess compliance with the MISRA rule forbidding self-calls.)"
