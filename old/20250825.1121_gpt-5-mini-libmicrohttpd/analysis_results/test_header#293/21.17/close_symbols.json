This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for the MISRA C string/bounds analysis:\n\n- struct test_header_param\n  - Needed to see the exact types and layout of fields used in the function (param->connection and param->num_headers). In particular, num_headers semantics and type affect the loop/indexing logic that selects which pos is compared.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - Required to locate the rq member and confirm the type and lifetime assumptions of the request object from which headers_received is taken.\n\n- type of connection->rq (request structure containing headers_received)\n  - The code uses connection->rq.headers_received; the request structure definition is needed to verify that headers_received is indeed a pointer to a linked list of MHD_HTTP_Req_Header and to understand its lifetime and ownership (whether the buffers it points to remain valid for the comparison).\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header\n  - Crucial to determine the exact types and sizes of the members referenced: next, kind, header_size, value_size, header, value. To check memcmp safety we must know that pos->header and pos->value point to objects at least pos->header_size and pos->value_size bytes long (and whether header/value are NUL-terminated or not is irrelevant for memcmp but their allocated sizes matter).\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind\n  - Needed to understand the meaning / possible values of kind and pos->kind so the filtering (if (kind != pos->kind) continue) is correct and to ensure the loop selection logic (which header is compared) is being analyzed with correct assumptions.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (and constants MHD_YES, MHD_NO)\n  - While not directly about memcmp bounds, knowing the return values and their meaning completes the function contract and helps ensure no additional implicit conversions or macros alter control flow that could affect checks before memcmp.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function)\n  - The code uses mhd_assert to check non-NULL pointers prior to calling memcmp. The definition/behaviour of mhd_assert matters: if it aborts in debug only (like assert) and compiles out in production, it cannot be relied on to prevent out-of-bounds accesses. Analysis must know whether mhd_assert enforces runtime checks or is a no-op in release builds.\n\n- memcmp (from <string.h>)\n  - The exact prototype and semantics (memcmp(void const*, void const*, size_t)) are required to reason about how many bytes are read and from which pointers. Also required to confirm that memcmp will access exactly the count argument bytes from both operands.\n\n- the header-iteration caller that invokes this callback and its contract for key/value/key_size/value_size (the MHD function that calls test_header)\n  - Very important: key, value, key_size and value_size are supplied by the caller of this callback. To determine whether memcmp will access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by key and value, we must examine the caller\u2019s contract/implementation to ensure the pointers are valid for the reported sizes and for the lifetime during this callback. The caller symbol (header iteration API in the MHD library) and its documentation/implementation are therefore required.\n\n- stddef definitions: size_t and NULL\n  - Standard types/macros used in memcmp arguments and null checks; included for completeness when reasoning about sizes and null-pointer comparisons.\n\nIn short: to prove that memcmp(key, pos->header, key_size) and memcmp(value, pos->value, value_size) never read past the referenced objects, the analyzer needs the definitions of the header structures (to know header/value buffer sizes and lifetimes), the callback-caller contract (to know that key/value are valid for key_size/value_size), the behavior of mhd_assert, and the memcmp prototype."
