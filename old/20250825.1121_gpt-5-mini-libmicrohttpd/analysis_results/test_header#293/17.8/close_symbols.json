Note that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- struct test_header_param: required to confirm that 'param = (struct test_header_param *)cls' makes 'num_headers' a member of the object pointed to by cls. If num_headers is a field of the object, incrementing param->num_headers modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter (allowed by MISRA), not the pointer parameter itself (disallowed).\n- struct MHD_Connection: required because test_header_param->connection is read and used to reach the headers list; ensures no aliasing or assignment to the parameter variables occurs through unexpected definitions.\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: required to verify that fields accessed (kind, header_size, value_size, header, value, next) are members of a heap/list node and that only those members are read \u2014 confirming the function does not write back into the incoming pointer parameters (key, value, key_size, value_size, kind, cls) themselves.\n- mhd_assert: required to check whether this macro/function could have side-effects (e.g. assign to a parameter). If it is a diagnostic/assert macro that only reads/test expressions (no assignments), it does not violate the rule.\n- memcmp: required to confirm it is a non-modifying library function (it only reads the memory pointed to by its pointer arguments), so its use does not modify the pointer parameters or objects passed by the caller in a way that violates the rule.\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: required to confirm that 'kind' is an integral/enum value (passed by value), and only compared (not assigned) in the function.\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO): included to show return symbols used; not required to prove modification, but helps confirm that no parameter is overwritten by use of these macros/constants.\n\nThese symbols let an analyzer determine whether the code performs any assignment to the function parameter variables themselves (e.g. cls = ..., key = ..., key_size = ..., value = ..., value_size = ..., kind = ...), versus modifying objects pointed to by pointer parameters (which is allowed)."
