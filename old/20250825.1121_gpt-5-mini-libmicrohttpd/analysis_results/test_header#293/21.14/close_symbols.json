  "explanation": "- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The function indexes pos->header, pos->header_size, pos->value and pos->value_size before calling memcmp. You must know the definition and documentation of this struct to determine whether pos->header/pos->value are NUL-terminated C strings or just byte buffers and whether header_size/value_size include or exclude a terminating NUL.\n- struct MHD_Connection: The list connection->rq.headers_received is the source of pos. You need the connection/rq type to confirm the origin and lifetime/format guarantees of the header nodes (i.e., that header/value pointers come from the HTTP layer with documented termination/length semantics).\n- struct test_header_param: Contains the connection pointer and num_headers used to select which header is compared. Knowing its definition verifies that the code is operating on the expected connection and that num_headers does not alter the interpretation of sizes/terminators.\n- Specification / prototype of the header-iteration callback (semantics of key, key_size, value, value_size): The parameters key/key_size/value/value_size are passed into this callback by the library; you must know the API contract (whether key/value are NUL-terminated, whether key_size/value_size are the string lengths excluding the terminator, or whether they can contain embedded NULs) to decide whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- mhd_assert macro / function: The code uses mhd_assert(NULL != key) and similar checks before memcmp. Inspecting mhd_assert shows whether it can guarantee additional properties (it typically only checks NULL) and therefore whether the code relies on it for safety beyond NULL-checking (it does not prove non-termination).\n- memcmp (standard library): To apply the MISRA rule you must recall memcmp semantics (it compares raw bytes for a given length and does not stop at NUL). Knowing this confirms that using memcmp over a region that is or may be a NUL-terminated string can violate the MISRA prohibition if the code uses memcmp where a string comparison function should be used.\n\nTogether these symbols/documents let an analyst determine whether the memcmp calls compare pure byte ranges (allowed) or are being used to compare null-terminated C strings (MISRA violation)."
