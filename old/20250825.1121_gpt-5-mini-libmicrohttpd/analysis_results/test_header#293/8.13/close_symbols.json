  "explanation": "- struct test_header_param (full definition): the function casts cls to this type and increments param->num_headers and reads param->connection. To decide whether cls or param->connection could/should be const-qualified (MISRA: prefer const where possible) we must see the exact field types and whether any fields are modified elsewhere. The definition shows whether connection is declared as pointer-to-const or non-const and whether num_headers is modifiable (explains why cls cannot be const).\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): the code reads connection->rq.headers_received. To determine whether the pointer to the connection (and its members) could be const-qualified here, we need the connection type definition to see which members are modified or have const qualifiers.\n\n- type/definition of connection->rq (the struct type that declares headers_received): headers_received is accessed from this nested member. The exact declaration of headers_received (its pointer type and any const qualifiers) is required to know whether assigning it to pos (non-const pointer) violates the rule or whether pos could/should be declared as a pointer-to-const.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header (full definition): pos is a pointer to this struct and the function reads pos->header and pos->value (both used only for comparison). To judge whether pos, pos->header and pos->value should be const-qualified (e.g., const struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos, const char *header, const char *value) we need the exact member types (header, value, next, header_size, value_size, kind) and their current constness in the definition.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (definition): although only used for comparisons, knowing the enum type confirms it is not a pointer and helps determine that the only pointer-related constness concerns are the struct/field pointers. Include to be complete when assessing if any pointer-to-enum or similar should be const.\n\n- memcmp prototype (from <string.h>): the function calls memcmp with key/pos->header and value/pos->value. memcmp's parameter types are const void *. To assess whether passing pos->header/pos->value (as declared in MHD_HTTP_Req_Header) to memcmp would require removing/adding const qualifiers (and thus whether those members should be const), we need the memcmp prototype to confirm it accepts const pointers.\n\n(These symbols are the ones required to decide whether pointers in test_header should be const-qualified or are necessarily non-const because they are modified. Other items in the translation unit such as MHD_YES/MHD_NO, mhd_assert macro, NULL and size_t are routine and do not affect the pointer constness decision here.)"
