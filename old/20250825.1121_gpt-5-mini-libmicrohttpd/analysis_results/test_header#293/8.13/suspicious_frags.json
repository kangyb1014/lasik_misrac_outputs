  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameters key and value are already const-qualified (const char *), so they comply with the rule. The size and enum parameters are non-pointer scalar types and not relevant to const-qualification. The numeric comparisons (key_size/value_size checks) and the mhd_assert calls are not pointer declarations that would benefit from adding const. The return statements and enum usage are not affected by pointer const-qualification. In short, only the pointer declarations/uses listed above should be examined for whether they could or should point to const-qualified types; the remainder of the code either already uses const where appropriate or does not involve pointer-to-object const-qualification concerns."
