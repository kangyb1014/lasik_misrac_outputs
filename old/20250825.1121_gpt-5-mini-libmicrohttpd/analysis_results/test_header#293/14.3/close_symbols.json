Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in test_header is invariant under MISRA C, the analyzer needs the concrete declarations and qualifiers (const/volatile) of the objects used in those expressions and any macros that might have side effects: \n\n- struct test_header_param: The function reads and writes param->num_headers and uses param->connection. The analyzer must know the exact type and qualifiers of num_headers (e.g., whether it is volatile/const) to determine whether comparisons involving param->num_headers can be treated as invariant during the loop.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The for-loop initializes pos from connection->rq.headers_received. The analyzer must know how connection is laid out and whether connection or its members are qualified (const/volatile) or have unusual semantics.\n\n- declaration of connection->rq (type) and its member headers_received: The controlling expression of the for-loop is 'NULL != pos' where pos starts from headers_received. If headers_received is a compile-time constant or declared const/volatile (or updated asynchronously elsewhere), that affects whether the loop condition can be considered invariant. The precise declaration of headers_received (pointer type and qualifiers) is required.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop advances pos via pos = pos->next and checks pos->kind, pos->header_size, pos->value_size, pos->header, pos->value. The analyzer must know the types and qualifiers of these fields (especially next and kind) to determine if the controlling expression 'NULL != pos' and the other conditionals can change across iterations or are invariant.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: The comparison 'if (kind != pos->kind)' uses this enum; the analyzer needs its definition to know if kind is a plain integer-like type and whether any special qualifiers apply.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function) definition: mhd_assert is invoked inside conditional branches. If it is a macro or function with potential side effects (e.g., longjmp, modifying globals), that could affect whether later controlling expressions remain invariant. The analyzer must know its definition to rule out unexpected state changes.\n\n(Other symbols such as memcmp and the MHD_Result enum values do not affect whether controlling expressions are invariant because they are not used to modify the loop control variables; they are not strictly required for this MISRA rule check.)"
