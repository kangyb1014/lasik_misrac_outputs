  "explanation": "For determining whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions of all referenced types, macros and symbols that might themselves be implemented with extensions. Brief rationale for each symbol: \n\n- struct test_header_param: the function casts cls to this struct and accesses param->connection and param->num_headers. Its definition may use compiler extensions (anonymous/packed/attributed fields, bit\u2011fields, flexible arrays, non\u2011standard alignment attributes) that would violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the code dereferences connection and reads connection->rq; the struct definition may contain extensions (attributes, anonymous unions/structs, packing, nonstandard qualifiers) that must be checked.\n\n- type of MHD_Connection::rq (the type that holds headers_received): rq is accessed to obtain headers_received; the type of rq (and its declaration) may introduce language extensions (anonymous structs, attributes) even if MHD_Connection itself looks normal.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: variable pos and fields pos->next, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value, pos->header_size, pos->value_size are used. The struct definition may use extensions (e.g. nonstandard pointer types, attributes, anonymous members, bitfields) that need inspection.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: the function compares kind to pos->kind; the enum definition could use compiler-specific extensions (explicit underlying types, attributes) that must be inspected.\n\n- enum MHD_Result: return values (MHD_YES/MHD_NO) likely map to this enum; its definition or associated macros could use extensions (nonstandard values, attributes).\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: these constants/macros determine the function returns. They might be defined as macros using compiler extensions (compound statements, GNU extensions) rather than plain enum constants or integer literals.\n\n- mhd_assert: used inside conditionals; it may be a macro or function that expands to implementation-defined or compiler\u2011specific constructs (e.g. __attribute__, statement expressions, variadic macro features) so its definition must be checked for extensions.\n\n- memcmp (prototype): although a standard C library function, the actual declaration or any wrappers used could be nonstandard or have attributes (builtins or macros). Verify the prototype used in the compilation unit to ensure no extension is introduced.\n\n- NULL macro: used with mhd_assert and pointer checks; some environments define NULL in nonstandard ways (e.g. ((void*)0) is standard, but unusual definitions or macros could use extensions) so confirm standard definition.\n\n- size_t typedef: used for key_size/value_size and loop variable; its typedef/source header should be standard. Nonstandard typedefs or compiler-specific integer types could be extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbol definitions (headers/macros/typedefs) is sufficient to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used in the target function or in the symbols it relies on."
