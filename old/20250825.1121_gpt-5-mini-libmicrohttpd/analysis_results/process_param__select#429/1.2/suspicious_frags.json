  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/Microsoft extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, __declspec, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or asm(\"...\").\n- No compiler-specific pragmas or inline assembly appear.\n- The ternary operator (?:), logical not (!), character comparison ('-' == param_name[1]), enum and static declarations, and the struct initialization with zero values are all standard C constructs.\n- The identifier naming does not begin with an implementation-reserved leading underscore (the function name contains a double underscore in the middle but does not start with an underscore), and no language-specific reserved keywords are used as identifiers.\n\nBecause none of the above compiler-specific extension constructs are present, there are no fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions)."
