  "explanation": "No fragment in this function is provably unreachable. The two early returns inside the if (tool_params.epoll) and if (tool_params.poll) branches are reachable depending on runtime flags. The assignment tool_params.select = ! 0; is reachable (it sets select to 1) and not dead code. The final ternary return can produce either branch depending on the contents of param_name[1], so neither result is statically unreachable. There are no statements following unconditional control transfers (e.g. code after a guaranteed return) or preprocessor/constant conditions that render any source lines impossible to execute, so no code here violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 as unreachable code."
