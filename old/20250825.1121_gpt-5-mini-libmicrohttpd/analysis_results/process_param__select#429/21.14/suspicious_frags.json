  "explanation": "No usages of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) appear in the provided function. The only string/character operation is a single-character comparison ('-' == param_name[1]) and accesses to param_name for printing; these do not involve memcmp and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Consequently there are no fragments in this function that need to be investigated for the specific Rule 21.14 violation."
