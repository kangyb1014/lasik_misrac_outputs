  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expressions in process_param__select violate MISRA C (\"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\") you must know whether the tested expressions can actually vary at runtime or are compile-time/translation-unit invariants. Specifically:\n\n- tool_params: The two if-expressions test tool_params.epoll and tool_params.poll and the body sets tool_params.select. You need the actual global variable symbol to inspect its declaration and linkage.\n\n- definition/type of tool_params (struct/typedef) including members 'epoll', 'poll', 'select' and their qualifiers: You must know the exact types and qualifiers (e.g. int, bool, const, volatile) of these members. If any member is declared const or as a macro-expanded compile-time constant, the controlling expression could be invariant. If members are volatile or plain non-const globals, they are not invariants for MISRA purposes.\n\n- tool_params initializer / global definition: The global definition (and any static initializer) may set constant values. If tool_params is defined and initialized to compile-time constants and never modified, the conditions would be invariant. The initializer and the translation-unit definition show whether the values are fixed at compile time.\n\n- all write-sites that may modify tool_params.epoll, tool_params.poll or tool_params.select (at least: process_param__epoll, process_param__poll, any other functions that assign those fields): To determine whether the tested members can change you need to know whether there exist assignments to these fields. The obvious candidates in the call graph are process_param__epoll and process_param__poll (they likely set the epoll/poll flags). If there are no write-sites, the expressions may be invariant; if writes exist (and are reachable before this function is called), then they are not invariant.\n\n- process_short_param and process_long_param: These two functions are callers of process_param__select. Knowing how they derive and pass param_name (and whether they call process_param__select in contexts where param_name is a constant string) is necessary to assess whether the expression '-' == param_name[1] could be invariant in practice. Also, they show the call context (order of parameter processing) which may affect whether tool_params flags were set before this call.\n\nCollecting these symbols (declarations and definitions, and the identified write-sites) allows an analyst to determine whether the controlling expressions in process_param__select are compile-time/translation-unit invariants or genuinely variable at runtime, and therefore whether the MISRA C rule is violated."
