  "explanation": "To decide if the function modifies its parameter (MISRA: function parameter shall not be modified) we need the following symbols and why:\n\n- param_name (const char *param_name): the exact parameter declaration is required to know whether the pointer itself or the pointed-to object is const. 'const char *' qualifies the pointed-to data, not the pointer; this affects whether assignments to *param_name or to param_name would violate the rule.\n\n- tool_params (global variable and its type/definition): the function assigns to tool_params.select. We must inspect the definition of tool_params to ensure that writing to its members cannot alias or otherwise modify the parameter (e.g. via a macro or union), and to confirm that these writes are to globals (which are allowed) rather than inadvertent modifications of the parameter object.\n\n- tool_params.epoll, tool_params.poll, tool_params.select (members and their types): the types show whether these are ordinary scalar fields (assignment is to a global) or some complex/macro-generated construct that could modify param_name; also confirm no pointer/aliasing relationship with param_name.\n\n- fprintf (prototype) and stderr (extern): param_name is passed to fprintf as a %s argument. Knowing fprintf's prototype (and stderr's type) confirms that fprintf will only read the string pointer (not modify the caller's pointer) and that passing param_name does not perform any modifications to the parameter.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result and the three return-symbols (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR): these are needed to fully understand the return expressions but do not affect whether the parameter is modified. They are included so the analyzer has all referenced symbols from the function for context and to rule out any surprising macro definitions that might perform side effects on param_name.\n\nWith these symbols the next agent can verify (1) the parameter's type/constness, (2) that no assignment to param_name or to *param_name occurs, (3) that calls and assignments inside the function cannot alias or mutate the parameter, and thus determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
