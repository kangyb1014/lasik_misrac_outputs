  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is declared as 'const char *param_name', and the code only reads from it (uses in fprintf and accesses param_name[1]) \u2014 there is no assignment to the parameter variable itself (no 'param_name = ...') and no attempt to modify the pointee (which is const). The only assignment present (tool_params.select = !0) modifies a global variable, not a function parameter. Therefore there is no apparent violation of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
