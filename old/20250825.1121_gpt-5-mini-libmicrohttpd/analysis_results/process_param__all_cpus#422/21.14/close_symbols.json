  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for determining a MISRA C violation (memcmp on null-terminated strings):\n\n- memcmp: The rule explicitly concerns use of memcmp. You must inspect whether this function (or any macro/inline it uses) calls memcmp directly or indirectly. If memcmp is not present anywhere reachable from this function, the rule cannot be violated here.\n\n- fprintf: The function calls fprintf. Although the standard fprintf does not compare strings with memcmp, in some codebases fprintf may be a macro or wrapper that could call other utilities. Inspect its definition/expansion to ensure no memcmp usage is hidden behind that call.\n\n- tool_params: This global/extern object is accessed in the function. You need the definition/type of tool_params (and any accessor macros) because macros or inline accessors could expand into code that uses memcmp. Also confirm that none of its fields are computed via functions that call memcmp.\n\n- struct/type of tool_params and members (threads, thread_per_conn, all_cpus): The exact declarations are required to check whether accessing these members involves any function calls, macros, or inline routines that might use memcmp (e.g., accessor macros or property-getter functions).\n\n- param_name (declaration / provenance): The MISRA rule concerns comparing null-terminated strings with memcmp. You must know what param_name points to (a C string literal, argv element, a buffer, etc.) to determine whether any string comparisons (if present) would be between null-terminated strings. Also inspect whether any macros or wrappers related to param_name perform memcmp.\n\n- PerfRepl_param_result and enum values (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR): Include these so the analyzer can locate their definitions and any macros around them. Though unlikely to involve memcmp, their definitions could be macros or inline constructs that expand to code invoking memcmp; confirming their definitions rules out such hidden uses.\n\nNote: The target function's source as given contains no explicit memcmp call. The symbols listed are the minimal additional declarations/definitions you should inspect to confidently conclude whether a memcmp-on-null-terminated-strings violation exists in or is hidden by this function (via macros/wrappers)."
