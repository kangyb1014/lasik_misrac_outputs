  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the statement uses fprintf with the \"%s\" format specifier, which is not one of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which targets functions like strcpy, memcpy, memset, etc.). Therefore this fragment does not itself violate Rule 21.17. (Note: if param_name were NULL, not NUL-terminated, or pointed outside accessible memory, the fprintf %s would still read out-of-bounds/UB \u2014 but that would be a general runtime/undefined-behavior issue, not a direct violation of Rule 21.17 which specifically concerns <string.h> functions.)"
