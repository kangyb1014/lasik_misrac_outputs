  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation of Rule 21.17: the code calls fprintf (stdio.h) with a \"%s\" format and does not call any <string.h> function such as memcpy/strlen/strcpy. Rule 21.17 specifically targets the string.h functions. Note: there is a potential runtime hazard if param_name is NULL or not NUL-terminated (fprintf with \"%s\" would then read out of bounds), but that is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 as quoted."
