  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in this function is the parameter \"param_name\", which is declared as \"const char *param_name\" (already const-qualified). All uses of it are read-only (used in fprintf and indexed as param_name[1]), and string literals passed to fprintf are also const. There are no other pointer variables, pointer assignments, casts to/from pointer types, or returns of pointer types in this function that would warrant investigation for missing const qualification."
