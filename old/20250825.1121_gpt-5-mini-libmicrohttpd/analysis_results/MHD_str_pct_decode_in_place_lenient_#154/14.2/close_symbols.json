The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "toxdigitvalue: Called from inside the while loop body. MISRA states that the behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement; likewise, any for loops inside a called function must be checked for well-formedness because their counters or side-effects could interact with the caller's loop semantics. Include the full definition of toxdigitvalue to find any for loops and confirm their loop counters and side-effects.\n\nMHD_str_pct_decode_lenient_n_: Used in the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE branch of this function. If the code is built with that macro defined, the target function delegates work to this function; any for loops inside it must be analysed for MISRA compliance (their counters, side-effects, and interactions). Provide its definition to check for offending for statements.\n\nstrlen: Called in the MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE branch to compute len. If analysing callees transitively (or if your build includes library implementations), strlen could contain for loops. Include its implementation or note its absence so the analysis can decide whether to inspect standard-library loop constructs for MISRA violations.\n\nMHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: Preprocessor macro that controls which branch of the target function is compiled. You must know whether this macro is defined for the build under analysis to determine whether to inspect MHD_str_pct_decode_lenient_n_ and strlen paths (and thus their for loops)."
