  "explanation": "I flagged all fragments that can produce early returns/continues and the preprocessor alternative, since these are the places where control flow branches sharply and could hide unreachable code in some build/config or input conditions. Specifically:\n- The #ifdef / #else block: only one side is compiled in any build; the other side is effectively excluded for that build and should be checked because a build configuration could make large portions of code unconditionally unreachable.\n- The d1==0 and d2==0 branches: both perform an immediate return after handling a truncated \"%\" sequence; these early returns make code that follows them in the loop body irrelevant for those input cases and should be confirmed as intentionally reachable/unreachable.\n- The invalid-hex branch ((0 > h) || (0 > l)) ends with continue after copying, which makes the valid-hex code path unreachable for that iteration \u2014 this is expected but worth checking for correctness.\n- The valid-hex conversion ends with a continue; that again makes the non-'%' character copy (str[w++] = chr;) unreachable when processing a '%' sequence \u2014 expected, but should be reviewed.\n- The final null-termination and return are the normal exit, but they should be checked to ensure no other code after them can be executed.\n\nAll other statements in the function (initializations, loop header, assignments that do not alter control flow) were reviewed and considered reachable under appropriate inputs or are part of the same branches listed above; therefore they do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1 beyond the flagged fragments."
