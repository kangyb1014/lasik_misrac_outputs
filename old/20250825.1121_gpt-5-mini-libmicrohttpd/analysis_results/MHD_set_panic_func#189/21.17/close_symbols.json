  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to determine MISRA C <string.h> violations:\n\n- mhd_panic: This global function-pointer holds the active panic callback. To know whether calling or setting this pointer can lead to out-of-bounds string operations you must inspect the concrete function(s) it points to and how it is used. The pointer declaration shows its type and linkage.\n\n- mhd_panic_std: The default fallback panic routine. Its implementation must be inspected for any use of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) and for correct bounds handling. If this function uses string routines incorrectly it would violate the rule even when the default is used.\n\n- MHD_PanicCallback: The typedef/signature of the callback. The parameter types (e.g., const char * message, void * cls, size_t length, etc.) determine how buffers/strings are passed into the callback and whether any string operations inside the callback could read/write beyond object bounds. You need the exact prototype to reason about argument semantics and required length guarantees.\n\n- mhd_panic_cls: The closure/context pointer passed to the panic callback. The callback implementation may treat this pointer as pointing to buffers or structures and may perform string operations on data reachable via this pointer. Knowing its declared type and uses is required to assess bounds safety.\n\n- All call sites that invoke mhd_panic: You must find every place the panic callback is invoked to inspect the actual arguments passed (pointers, lengths, buffers). MISRA string-rule violations depend on how callbacks are called and what data they operate on; so all invocation sites are needed to ensure buffers passed to string functions are in-bounds.\n\n- All other assignments to mhd_panic: Any code that assigns alternative callbacks (besides MHD_set_panic_func) can install functions that use string.h routines unsafely. You need to locate and inspect those assignments and the corresponding callback implementations.\n\n- MHD_init: It is a documented caller of MHD_set_panic_func (from the call graph). Inspecting MHD_init can show how the panic callback is initialized at startup (what cb/cls are passed) and whether any initial arguments or state could lead to unsafe string operations.\n\nIn short, because MHD_set_panic_func only stores a pointer and a closure, determining compliance with the MISRA <string.h> rule requires examining the callback type, the default callback implementation, all concrete callback implementations assigned to mhd_panic, and every site that invokes the callback (and the arguments passed). These symbols/locations provide the necessary context to check for out-of-bounds uses of string.h functions."
