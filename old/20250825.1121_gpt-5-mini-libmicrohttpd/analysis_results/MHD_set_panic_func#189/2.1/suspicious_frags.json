  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided sources. Reasoning: \n- MHD_set_panic_func: both branches of the if are reachable depending on the runtime value of cb; there is no code after a return/abort inside this function that would be unreachable.\n- mhd_panic_std: the function ends with abort() and is correctly declared noreturn; there is no code following abort() in this function, so there is no unreachable tail code to inspect.\n- The global initialization and assignments (mhd_panic, mhd_panic_cls) are reachable and used (MHD_init calls MHD_set_panic_func(NULL, NULL)).\n- The conditional-compilation (#if / #ifdef) regions change which code is compiled but do not introduce unreachable code in the fragments shown; no else-branches or statements are present that are provably unreachable at compile time.\n- The debug block uses if (1) to force execution in debug builds, but it contains only reachable code and no else branch; therefore it does not introduce unreachable code.\n\nGiven the supplied code, there are no code fragments that are provably unreachable and that require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
