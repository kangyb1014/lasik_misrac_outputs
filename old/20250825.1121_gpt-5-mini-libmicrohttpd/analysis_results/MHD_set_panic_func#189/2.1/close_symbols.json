  "explanation": "- MHD_init: caller(s) of MHD_set_panic_func must be inspected to know what argument(s) are actually passed at each call site. If MHD_init (or other callers) always passes a constant NULL or always a non-NULL value, one branch in MHD_set_panic_func would be statically unreachable.\n- MHD_PanicCallback (typedef): the function-pointer type and its definition are needed to interpret the cast (MHD_PanicCallback) NULL and the comparison against cb; this affects whether the comparison can be evaluated to a constant and whether either branch can be ruled out.\n- mhd_panic (global): the target of the assignment in one branch. Its declaration (type, linkage, qualifiers, initializer) is required to determine whether the assignment is meaningful or redundant and whether any compiler/analysis would consider that code unreachable.\n- mhd_panic_std (symbol): the default panic handler whose address is assigned in the else branch. Its existence/type/visibility (function vs. object, static/extern) is needed to tell whether taking &mhd_panic_std is valid and whether that branch can ever be optimized away or is unreachable.\n- mhd_panic_cls (global): the storage receiving cls; its declaration (type, qualifiers) is required to determine whether the assignment is meaningful or possibly dead code.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine the actual possible values of cb at all call sites and whether either assignment branch (and the assignment to mhd_panic_cls) can never be executed (i.e., is unreachable) under the whole-program usage."
