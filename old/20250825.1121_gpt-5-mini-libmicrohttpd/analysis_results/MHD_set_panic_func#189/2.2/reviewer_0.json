  "explanation": "Agent A is incorrect. The three \u2018\u2018(void) param;\u2019\u2019 statements are the conventional way to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler diagnostics; they are a deliberate, explanatory no\u2011op and are retained for a reason (to ensure the code compiles cleanly in the !HAVE_MESSAGES configuration). MISRA Rule 2.2 targets operations that are truly redundant with respect to program behaviour. Although the casts have no runtime effect, their presence affects compilation/diagnostics and documents intent; MISRA practice accepts the explicit (void)parameter idiom for unused parameters rather than treating it as prohibited dead code. Therefore this does not constitute a Rule 2.2 violation."
