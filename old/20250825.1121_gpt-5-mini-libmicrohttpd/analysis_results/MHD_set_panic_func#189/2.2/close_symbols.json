  "explanation": "mhd_panic \u2014 the global function pointer assigned in MHD_set_panic_func. To decide if the assignment is dead you must know where and how this variable is used (i.e. whether removal of this assignment changes behavior). If no code ever reads/invokes it, the assignment would be dead; if it is invoked, the assignment affects program behavior.\n\nmhd_panic_cls \u2014 the companion context pointer assigned here. Same rationale as mhd_panic: determining whether storing cls is necessary requires inspecting all readers of this variable (call sites that pass it into the panic callback).\n\nmhd_panic_std \u2014 the default panic handler used when cb is NULL. You need its presence and semantics to know whether assigning a pointer to this function changes behavior (for example if mhd_panic_std is identical to previously stored value, assignment could be redundant) and whether it has observable side effects when invoked.\n\nMHD_PanicCallback \u2014 the typedef/signature of the callback. Knowing the callback signature helps determine whether calls through mhd_panic can have side effects that matter for behavior, and whether the stored cls is ever used. It also helps identify all call sites that match the signature.\n\nMHD_init \u2014 a caller of MHD_set_panic_func (shown in the call graph). You must inspect where and when MHD_set_panic_func is invoked (during initialization or later), and with what arguments; initialization context matters for the MISRA dead-code judgement (note about initialization semantics).\n\nall call sites that invoke mhd_panic \u2014 every location that calls through the mhd_panic function pointer (if any). These determine whether assigning mhd_panic in MHD_set_panic_func affects runtime behavior; if there are no call sites, the assignment is dead.\n\nall call sites that assign mhd_panic or mhd_panic_cls (other setters / initializers) \u2014 other places that overwrite these globals matter because if MHD_set_panic_func\u2019s assignment is always immediately overwritten before any use, it is dead. You must find all writers to these globals to determine whether this specific assignment ever influences behavior."
