  "explanation": "- mhd_panic: the global function-pointer assigned in MHD_set_panic_func. You must inspect all places this variable is invoked/assigned to locate actual panic callback implementations that might call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Assignment alone does not violate MISRA C; the implementations invoked through this pointer might.\n- mhd_panic_std: the default panic handler used when cb is NULL. Its implementation must be examined for any use of memcmp (or other string-comparison misuse) because assigning its address here makes it a runtime panic callback.\n- MHD_PanicCallback: the typedef/signature of the panic callback. Knowing the parameter types (e.g., char* or other string parameters) is necessary to determine whether any memcmp calls in callback implementations are being (mis)used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- mhd_panic_cls: the context pointer stored here; its use sites (where it is passed to or used by panic callbacks) must be checked because callbacks may receive this context and perform string comparisons there.\n- MHD_init: the caller of MHD_set_panic_func. Include it to follow the initialization flow and to find other places where panic callbacks are registered or where mhd_panic is invoked; those sites may contain memcmp usage relevant to the MISRA rule.\n- memcmp: the standard-library function itself must be checked in the codebase (especially in panic callback implementations and other functions reachable from mhd_panic) to determine whether it is used to compare null-terminated strings (the specific MISRA violation to detect)."
