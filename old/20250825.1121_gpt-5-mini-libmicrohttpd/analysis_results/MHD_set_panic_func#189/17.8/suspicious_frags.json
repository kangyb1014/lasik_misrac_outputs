  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The parameters cb and cls are only read (used in the conditional and assigned to globals), not assigned to or otherwise altered. The pointer parameter cls is not dereferenced or used to modify the object it points to. The cast and comparison ((MHD_PanicCallback) NULL != cb) only read cb. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and no further investigation is required."
