  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. Rule 14.3 targets loop and conditional controlling expressions that are constant (invariant). This function contains a single if-statement with condition ((MHD_PanicCallback) NULL != cb), which depends on the parameter cb and therefore is not invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements with constant controlling expressions. The cast of NULL to the function-pointer type does not make the condition a compile-time constant \u2014 it still depends on the runtime value of cb. All other statements are simple assignments and not subject to Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
