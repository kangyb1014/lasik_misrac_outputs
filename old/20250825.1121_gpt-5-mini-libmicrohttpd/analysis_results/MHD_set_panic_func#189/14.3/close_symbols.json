  "explanation": "To decide if the controlling expression '(MHD_PanicCallback) NULL != cb' is invariant under MISRA C, the analyser must know the exact types and declarations involved and any qualifiers or macro definitions that could make the expression constant:\n\n- MHD_PanicCallback: need the typedef or declaration to know whether this name denotes a function\u2011pointer type, an integer type, or a macro/alias. If it is not actually a variable type (e.g. a macro or an integral constant), the comparison could be invariant.\n\n- mhd_panic: its declaration/type shows what kind of object the assignment targets (must be compatible with MHD_PanicCallback). This helps confirm that cb is a runtime-supplied value (not a compile-time constant) and that the comparison semantics are pointer comparison, not some other domain that could be invariant.\n\n- mhd_panic_std: its declaration (usually a function) is needed to verify that '&mhd_panic_std' yields a value of the same pointer type as MHD_PanicCallback and that taking its address is not a compile-time constant that would make branches invariant.\n\n- mhd_panic_cls: included because it is assigned from cls; its type/qualifiers may clarify whether cls or related symbols have qualifiers that would affect whether cb/cls can vary at run time (e.g. if cls were a macro or const expression). While not directly used in the controlling expression, its declaration helps confirm the routine's intent and typical types.\n\n- NULL: need the macro definition to ensure its type/value (e.g. ((void*)0) or 0) and to confirm that the cast '(MHD_PanicCallback) NULL' does not produce a compile-time constant of a type that would make the comparison always true/false.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyser determine whether 'cb' can have varying runtime values (thus making the controlling expression non\u2011invariant) or whether some typedef/macro/qualifier makes the comparison an invariant, which would violate the MISRA rule."
