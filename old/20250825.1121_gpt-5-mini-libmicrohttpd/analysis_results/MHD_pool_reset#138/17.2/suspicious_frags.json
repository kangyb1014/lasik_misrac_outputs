  "explanation": "I included all function calls and macro invocations present in MHD_pool_reset that could potentially participate in an indirect call cycle (i.e. anything that invokes a function or macro which might, directly or indirectly, call back to MHD_pool_reset). I did not include fragments that are purely local operations and cannot create call edges (local variable declarations, simple assignments or arithmetic expressions, pointer dereferences used as data, comments, and the final return of pool->memory). Those non-call fragments cannot cause direct or indirect self-calls and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2."
