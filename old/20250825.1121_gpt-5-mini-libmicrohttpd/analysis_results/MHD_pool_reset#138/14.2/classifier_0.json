  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_reset:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_pool_reset (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                void *keep,\n                size_t copy_bytes,\n                size_t new_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (copy_bytes <= new_size);\n  mhd_assert (copy_bytes <= pool->size);\n  mhd_assert (keep != NULL || copy_bytes == 0);\n  mhd_assert (keep == NULL || mp_ptr_le_ (pool->memory, keep));\n  /* (keep == NULL || pool->memory + pool->size >= (uint8_t*) keep + copy_bytes) */\n  mhd_assert ((keep == NULL) || \\\n              (pool->size >= mp_ptr_diff_ (keep, pool->memory) + copy_bytes));\n#if defined(MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE) && defined(HAVE___ASAN_REGION_IS_POISONED)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == __asan_region_is_poisoned (keep, copy_bytes));\n#endif /* MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE && HAVE___ASAN_REGION_IS_POISONED */\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (pool->memory, new_size);\n  if ( (NULL != keep) &&\n       (keep != pool->memory) )\n  {\n    if (0 != copy_bytes)\n      memmove (pool->memory,\n               keep,\n               copy_bytes);\n  }\n  /* technically not needed, but safer to zero out */\n  if (pool->size > copy_bytes)\n  {\n    size_t to_zero;   /** Size of area to zero-out */\n\n    to_zero = pool->size - copy_bytes;\n    _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (pool->memory + copy_bytes, to_zero);\n#ifdef _WIN32\n    if (pool->is_mmap)\n    {\n      size_t to_recommit;     /** Size of decommitted and re-committed area. */\n      uint8_t *recommit_addr;\n      /* Round down to page size */\n      to_recommit = to_zero - to_zero % MHD_sys_page_size_;\n      recommit_addr = pool->memory + pool->size - to_recommit;\n\n      /* De-committing and re-committing again clear memory and make\n       * pages free / available for other needs until accessed. */\n      if (VirtualFree (recommit_addr,\n                       to_recommit,\n                       MEM_DECOMMIT))\n      {\n        to_zero -= to_recommit;\n\n        if (recommit_addr != VirtualAlloc (recommit_addr,\n                                           to_recommit,\n                                           MEM_COMMIT,\n                                           PAGE_READWRITE))\n          abort ();      /* Serious error, must never happen */\n      }\n    }\n#endif /* _WIN32 */\n    memset (&pool->memory[copy_bytes],\n            0,\n            to_zero);\n  }\n  pool->pos = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (new_size);\n  pool->end = pool->size;\n  _MHD_POISON_MEMORY (((uint8_t *) pool->memory) + new_size, \\\n                      pool->size - new_size);\n  return pool->memory;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (pool->memory + copy_bytes, to_zero);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No for loop is present in the given fragment: it is a macro/function call _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(pool->memory + copy_bytes, to_zero); therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (about well-formed for loops) is not applicable and not violated. Note: if the _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY macro expands to one or more for statements, those expansions would need to be inspected separately to ensure they meet Rule 14.2."
