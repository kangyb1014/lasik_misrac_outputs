  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call uses memset(&pool->memory[copy_bytes], 0, to_zero) with to_zero = pool->size - copy_bytes, and is only executed when pool->size > copy_bytes. Thus the memset covers bytes copy_bytes .. pool->size-1, which are within the allocated pool->memory of size pool->size. (There are also mhd_assert checks ensuring copy_bytes <= pool->size.) Note: if the preconditions/guards were not present or pool->memory were smaller than pool->size, then an out-of-bounds access could occur (e.g. copy_bytes > pool->size or corrupted pool->size)."
