  "scenario": "The call memmove(pool->memory, keep, copy_bytes) depends only on mhd_assert checks to guarantee that both the source and destination regions are at least copy_bytes long (asserts: copy_bytes <= pool->size and pool->size >= (keep - pool->memory) + copy_bytes). If those asserts are compiled out or not enforced at runtime, memmove can read or write beyond the bounds. Example violation: pool->size == 100, keep == pool->memory + 10, copy_bytes == 200 \u2014 memmove will write 200 bytes into a destination of only 100 bytes (out-of-bounds write); or keep == pool->memory + 80, copy_bytes == 40 \u2014 memmove will read 40 bytes starting at offset 80 (src extends past pool end)."
