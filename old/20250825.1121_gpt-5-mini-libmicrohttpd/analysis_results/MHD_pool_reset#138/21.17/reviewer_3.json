True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\n_MHD_POISON_MEMORY is called with pointer (pool->memory + new_size) and length (pool->size - new_size). If new_size > pool->size (there is no prior assertion in this function that new_size <= pool->size), the length underflows (size_t wrap) producing a very large value and the call (typically expanding to memset or similar) will write/read far beyond the pool memory. Thus use of the string.h function via the macro can access beyond the object bounds.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The function does not assert or otherwise ensure new_size <= pool->size. As written, calls that expand to string.h routines (e.g. _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(pool->memory, new_size) near the top and _MHD_POISON_MEMORY(pool->memory + new_size, pool->size - new_size) at the end) can be invoked with new_size > pool->size. The expression pool->size - new_size then underflows (size_t wrap), producing a very large length and causing the underlying memset-like macro to access well beyond the bounds of pool->memory. That is exactly the kind of out-of-bounds access forbidden by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. To comply, the code must ensure (e.g. via an assertion or conditional) that new_size <= pool->size before calling these memory functions."
