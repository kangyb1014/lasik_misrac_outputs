If new_size is larger than the allocated object (e.g. pool->size == 1024 and new_size == 2048), the unpoison routine (which typically invokes ASAN APIs or may internally use memset) would access memory beyond the bounds of pool->memory, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The code does not assert or check that new_size <= pool->size before calling _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(pool->memory, new_size) (and later before _MHD_POISON_MEMORY(((uint8_t*)pool->memory) + new_size, pool->size - new_size) and the memset). If new_size > pool->size the pointer arithmetic (pool->memory + new_size) and the size arguments (new_size or pool->size - new_size which will underflow) can result in accesses beyond the allocated object. _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY and _MHD_POISON_MEMORY are likely to invoke ASAN APIs or standard routines such as memset, so those calls can perform out-of-bounds accesses. Because there is no guarantee in the shown code that new_size is bounded by pool->size, this can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Fix: enforce or assert new_size <= pool->size, and/or add runtime checks before the unpoison/memset/poison calls.)"
