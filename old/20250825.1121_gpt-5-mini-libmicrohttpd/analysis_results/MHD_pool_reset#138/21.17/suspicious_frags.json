  "explanation": "Only calls to functions from <string.h> (and related helpers that may wrap them) need investigation for Rule 21.17. The code contains direct uses of memmove and memset which must be checked to ensure their pointer/length arguments do not access beyond object bounds; those are reported. The _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY and _MHD_POISON_MEMORY calls are also reported because they may be implemented using string.h functions (e.g. memset) and thus could be relevant. Other fragments are not reported because they do not call string.h functions: the mhd_assert checks and mp_ptr_*_ helpers are bounds checks (they enforce preconditions but are not library string functions), the VirtualFree/VirtualAlloc/abort sequence uses OS APIs (not <string.h>), pointer arithmetic and ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE are not string.h calls, and no other standard string functions (memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, memcmp, strlen, strspn) are present. Therefore further investigation should focus on the listed fragments."
