True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameter 'keep' is declared as void * but is only used for read-only operations (checked for NULL, used as the source argument of memmove, and for pointer arithmetic/inspections). It should be declared as const void *keep so the pointer points to a const-qualified type. Thus the current usage violates Rule 8.13. (If the function actually needed to modify the pointee, a non-const would be justified, but no such modification occurs in this code.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. The parameter 'keep' is only used for read-only operations (NULL checks, pointer comparisons/differences, ASAN check, and as the source argument to memmove which takes a const void *). There is no code that modifies the pointee through 'keep', so it can and should be declared as const void *keep under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only caveat is if some of the helper functions/macros used here (e.g. mp_ptr_le_, mp_ptr_diff_ or assertion macros) have prototypes that require a non-const void *; in that case those prototypes should be updated to accept const pointers instead. As shown, the current code therefore violates Rule 8.13."
