True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameter 'keep' is declared as void * but is only read (used in pointer arithmetic mp_ptr_diff_ and as the source argument to memmove). It should be declared as const void * (and mp_ptr_diff_ should accept a pointer-to-const) so that the pointer points to a const-qualified type. In this fragment the non-const 'keep' violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The parameter keep is only inspected (pointer arithmetic, comparisons) and passed as the source argument to memmove (whose prototype takes a const void *src). The function never modifies the object pointed to by keep, so per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const void *keep). Any helper macros/functions used (mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_) should likewise accept pointers-to-const as appropriate. Note: changing the API may have backwards-compatibility implications, but that does not negate that the current code violates the \u201cshould\u201d of Rule 8.13."
