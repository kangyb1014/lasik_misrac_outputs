  "explanation": "Only the parameter 'keep' is a candidate for const-qualification: it is only used as a source (read-only) for memmove and in pointer comparisons/ASAN queries, so it can and should be declared as 'const void *' if the implementation never writes through it. Other pointers in the function are used to modify memory or the MemoryPool structure (e.g. 'pool' and 'pool->memory' are destinations for memmove/memset, fields pool->pos/pool->end are assigned), therefore they must remain non-const. The function return is a mutable pointer to the pool memory and is intended for further modification by callers, so it should not be const. The poisoning/unpoisoning and Windows VirtualFree/VirtualAlloc usages operate on memory that is modified or managed, so those pointers are appropriately non-const. Consequently, no other fragments need to be investigated for Rule 8.13."
