  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The parameter keep is never modified in MHD_pool_reset \u2014 it is only compared, used in pointer-difference/assertion checks and passed as the source argument to memmove (which takes a const void *). Therefore keep could, and per MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 should, be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const void *keep). The only caveats would be external constraints (macros or APIs that require a non-const pointer type in their prototype), but nothing in the function body requires keep to be mutable. Thus the reported violation is valid."
