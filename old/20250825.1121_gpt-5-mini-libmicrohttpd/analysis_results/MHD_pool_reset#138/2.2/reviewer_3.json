  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. Under the provided project configuration mhd_assert is defined as ((void)0). The statement mhd_assert(pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos); therefore becomes an executed no-op ((void)0); which has no effect on program behaviour \u2014 removing it would not change the program. That matches MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2\u2019s definition of dead code. (The same observation applies to the other macros in the function that expand to (void)0, e.g. _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY/_MHD_POISON_MEMORY: they also make executed no-op statements.) If the project truly defines mhd_assert as ((void)0) in all builds, the report is correct. If, however, mhd_assert can be defined to perform checks in some build configurations, then the code may not be dead in those configurations and the rule assessment should be made per-project configuration."
