  "explanation": "For determining whether any operations inside MHD_pool_reset are dead code (i.e. can be removed without affecting program behaviour) the analyzer must know which expressions/macros expand to real runtime effects, which are no-ops, and what state changes are externally observable. The listed symbols are required for that reasoning:\n\n- struct MemoryPool, pool->memory, pool->size, pool->pos, pool->end, pool->is_mmap: The structure layout and semantics are required to assess whether assignments to pos/end and writes into memory are observable by other code (if no other code reads them, the assignments could be dead). Knowing whether is_mmap is used influences whether the Windows decommit/recommit block can execute.\n\n- mhd_assert: Needs its definition/expansion to know whether the assert calls generate runtime checks or are compiled out (if compiled out they are dead/no-op); that affects whether those lines are executable code.\n\n- mp_ptr_le_, mp_ptr_diff_: These helpers/macros are used inside asserts to validate pointer ranges; their definitions determine whether any side-effects exist and whether the assert expressions are meaningful/runtime or removed.\n\n- _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY, _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: These are instrumentation macros (ASAN/no-op variants). Their definitions tell whether these calls perform memory writes/metadata changes (observable) or are compiled to nothing (potential dead code).\n\n- MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE, HAVE___ASAN_REGION_IS_POISONED: Compile-time flags control inclusion of additional checks; presence/absence changes which statements exist in the compiled function.\n\n- __asan_region_is_poisoned: If the ASAN check is compiled in, this function call is a runtime effect and must be considered; if absent, related assert is dead/omitted.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: Macro/function computing new pos value; its exact computation determines whether pool->pos assignment alters state in a meaningful way (could equal previous value making assignment redundant) and thus whether it is dead.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: Used to compute to_recommit; its value affects whether the Windows VM operations are taken and whether the to_recommit computation is non-zero (and thus whether that block does anything).\n\n- _WIN32: Conditional compilation symbol that controls whether the VirtualFree/VirtualAlloc block exists; must be known to know if those calls are present (dead vs not compiled).\n\n- VirtualFree, VirtualAlloc, MEM_DECOMMIT, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE: Windows API calls/constants used in the decommit/recommit sequence. Their semantics (success/failure, side-effects) determine whether that block is necessary or could be removed without changing behaviour.\n\n- memmove, memset: Standard library calls that modify pool->memory contents. Their presence is clearly externally observable (memory contents change); the analyzer needs their semantics and whether their calls are ever bypassed (e.g., by zero copy_bytes) to decide if they are dead.\n\n- abort: If called on VirtualAlloc failure, this is a strong externally visible behaviour; must be known whether that path can be taken and thus not dead.\n\nIn short, to decide if any statement in MHD_pool_reset is dead code you must know which macros/functions are real runtime operations vs compile-time/no-op expansions, the MemoryPool layout and which fields/contents are observed elsewhere, and whether platform-specific blocks (ASAN, _WIN32) are included. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to make that determination."
