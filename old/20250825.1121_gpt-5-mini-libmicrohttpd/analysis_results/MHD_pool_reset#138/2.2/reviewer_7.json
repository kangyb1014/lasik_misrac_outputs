  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct for the presented project configuration. In the supplied build the macros (for example _MHD_POISON_MEMORY, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY and mhd_assert) are defined as (void)0, so each call becomes an expression statement that does nothing at run time. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code. Those no-op expression statements are executed but removable without changing behaviour, therefore they meet the definition of dead code and violate Rule 2.2 in this project.\n\nNote: If the project were built with different macro definitions that perform real actions (e.g. ASan/imposition or active asserts), then the statements would not be dead in that configuration. The rule applies to the delivered project/configuration; given the provided macro definitions the agent A's report is correct. Suggested remedies include removing the no-op calls in the configuration where they are no-ops, or using conditional compilation so that the statements are absent rather than present as no-op statements (or otherwise document/justify and obtain an approved deviation)."
