The function advances the pointer (e.g. while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str || ',' == *str) str++; and const char sc = *(str++);), which alters the parameter value itself. Rule 17.8 forbids modifying pointer parameters (the pointed-to object may be modified, but not the pointer), so this is a violation.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_lookup_header_token_ci:\nstruct MHD_Connection\n{\n\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextE;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevE;\n#endif\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   * This DLL can be either the\n   * 'manual_timeout_head/manual_timeout_tail' or the\n   * 'normal_timeout_head/normal_timeout_tail', depending on whether a\n   * custom timeout is set for the connection.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextX;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevX;\n\n  /**\n   * Reference to the MHD_Daemon struct.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;\n\n  /**\n   * Request-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Request rq;\n\n  /**\n   * Reply-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Reply rp;\n\n  /**\n   * The memory pool is created whenever we first read from the TCP\n   * stream and destroyed at the end of each request (and re-created\n   * for the next request).

  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the named function. MHD_lookup_header_token_ci itself does not assign to or modify any of its parameter variables; it only passes pos->value into MHD_str_has_token_caseless_. Rule 17.8 forbids modifying a function's own parameter variables (and in the case of pointer parameters forbids changing the pointer itself). The code that actually increments the pointer (str++) is inside MHD_str_has_token_caseless_, so any Rule 17.8 violation would be in MHD_str_has_token_caseless_\u2014not in MHD_lookup_header_token_ci. To fix the actual issue make MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ avoid modifying its parameter (for example, declare a local pointer variable = str and advance that, or change the parameter to const char * const str to prevent modification)."
