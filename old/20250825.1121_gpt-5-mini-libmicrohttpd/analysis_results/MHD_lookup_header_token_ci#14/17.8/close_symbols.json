  "explanation": "For MISRA rule checking that function parameters themselves are not modified we must inspect any symbols that affect or could hide modifications to those parameters inside this function:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - Reason: the function reads connection->rq.headers_received. We must see the MHD_Connection definition (and its rq sub-structure) to ensure there are no macros/inline definitions or unusual member types that could expand to assign to the local parameter variable 'connection' (or otherwise hide writes to it). Also to confirm the type of headers_received.\n\n- headers_received (member of MHD_Connection)\n  - Reason: explicitly check the declaration/type of headers_received (the head of the header list) so we can confirm the for-loop initialization 'pos = connection->rq.headers_received' is a plain read and not a macro or accessor that could modify the parameter variable.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header\n  - Reason: the loop iterates over struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos and reads pos->next, pos->kind, pos->header_size, pos->header and pos->value. We need the struct layout and member types to ensure none of these members are implemented as macros/inline functions that could perform an assignment to one of the function parameters (or otherwise alias them in a way that causes the parameter variable to be modified).\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND\n  - Reason: this macro/constant appears in an expression (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND). We need its definition to ensure it is a simple constant and not a macro that could expand to code that assigns to parameters.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_\n  - Reason: this function/macro is called with 'header' as an argument. We must inspect its prototype/definition to ensure it is not a macro or inline routine that performs assignments to the caller's parameter variable (for example via parameter-like macros or by taking a pointer-to-pointer and writing back). Even if the callee modifies the pointed-to object, MISRA allows that; we only need to ensure the parameter variable header itself is not reassigned by an expansion.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_\n  - Reason: same as above for the 'token' parameter \u2014 verify the function/macro signature/definition to ensure it does not expand or behave in a way that reassigns the local parameter variable 'token' (or other parameter variables) within this function.\n\n(Notes: standard typedefs like size_t and bool are presumed standard and do not affect whether the parameter variables are reassigned. The listed symbols are the ones whose definitions could conceal assignments or macro expansions that would violate the MISRA requirement.)"
