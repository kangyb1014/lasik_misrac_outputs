  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_header_token_ci:\n```c\nstatic bool\nMHD_lookup_header_token_ci (const struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                            const char *header,\n                            size_t header_len,\n                            const char *token,\n                            size_t token_len)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if ((NULL == connection) || (NULL == header) || (0 == header[0]) ||\n      (NULL == token) || (0 == token[0]))\n    return false;\n\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n  {\n    if ((0 != (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND)) &&\n        (header_len == pos->header_size) &&\n        ( (header == pos->header) ||\n          (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (header,\n                                          pos->header,\n                                          header_len)) ) &&\n        (MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (pos->value, token, token_len)))\n      return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_lookup_header_token_ci:\nstruct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header\n{\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Headers are kept in a double-linked list.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * The name of the header (key), without the colon.\n   */\n  const char *header;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a header, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t header_size;\n\n  /**\n   * The value of the header.\n   */\n  const char *value;\n\n  /**\n   * The length of the @a value, not including the final zero termination.\n   */\n  size_t value_size;\n\n  /**\n   * Type of the value.\n   */\n  enum MHD_ValueKind kind;\n\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_Connection\n{\n\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextE;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevE;\n#endif\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   * This DLL can be either the\n   * 'manual_timeout_head/manual_timeout_tail' or the\n   * 'normal_timeout_head/normal_timeout_tail', depending on whether a\n   * custom timeout is set for the connection.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextX;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevX;\n\n  /**\n   * Reference to the MHD_Daemon struct.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;\n\n  /**\n   * Request-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Request rq;\n\n  /**\n   * Reply-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Reply rp;\n\n  /**\n   * The memory pool is created whenever we first read from the TCP\n   * stream and destroyed at the end of each request (and re-created\n   * for the next request).

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The loop uses a single loop counter (pos). First clause initializes the counter (pos = connection->rq.headers_received), second clause tests only the counter (NULL != pos) with no side effects, and the third clause updates only the counter (pos = pos->next). The loop body does not modify pos itself. Therefore the for statement is well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (assuming called functions do not modify the loop counter or list links)."
