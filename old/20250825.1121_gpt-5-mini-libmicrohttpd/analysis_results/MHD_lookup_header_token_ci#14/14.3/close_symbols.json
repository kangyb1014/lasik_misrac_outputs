  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C: \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\" you must be able to decide whether the loop and conditional controlling expressions can be considered compile\u2011time (or constant) invariants or are influenced at runtime. The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (including member rq and rq.headers_received): the for-loop initialiser uses connection->rq.headers_received. You must know the type, storage and mutability of headers_received (e.g. whether it is a constant/compile\u2011time value, volatile, or otherwise guaranteed NULL) to decide if the loop condition \"NULL != pos\" could be invariant.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header (fields: next, kind, header_size, header, value): the loop increment uses pos = pos->next and the if condition tests pos->kind, pos->header_size, pos->header and pos->value. You need the definitions of these fields (types, const/volatile qualifiers, possible invariants, and whether next can form self\u2011referencing/cyclic lists) to determine whether the controlling expression of the for loop or the if condition can evaluate to a constant value.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND (macro/constant): used in the subexpression (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND). If this macro is e.g. zero or otherwise causes the bitwise test to be invariant, that can make part (or all) of the controlling boolean expression invariant; you must know its value/definition.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (declaration/definition/macro): this function/macro is used in a controlling boolean subexpression. If it is a macro or inline that expands to a compile\u2011time constant or has side effects that affect control flow, that matters for the invariant analysis.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (declaration/definition/macro): same reason as above \u2014 it participates in the controlling boolean expression; its implementation/definition determines whether the expression can be considered invariant or has side effects.\n\n(Other built\u2011in types/macros such as NULL, size_t and the bool typedef are not sufficient by themselves to establish invariance; the above project symbols are the ones that can make the controlling expressions constant or otherwise invariant.)"
