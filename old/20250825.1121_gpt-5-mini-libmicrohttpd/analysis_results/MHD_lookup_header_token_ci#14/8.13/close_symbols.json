  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: needed to know the exact type of connection->rq and how headers_received is declared (pointer type and const-qualification of the pointed-to element). The target function takes a const struct MHD_Connection *, so we must confirm whether its members (headers_received) are declared to point to const or non-const data.\n\n- struct <whatever_type> rq (the type of the rq member inside MHD_Connection) / definition of connection->rq.headers_received: headers_received is accessed in the function; its declaration determines whether it is a pointer-to-const or pointer-to-non-const. This affects whether pointer fields could/should be const-qualified under MISRA.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: must see the full field declarations (types and const qualifiers) for kind, header_size, header, value, next. In particular, whether header and value are declared as const char * or char * determines whether the target function is passing non-const pointers around and whether those members themselves should have been declared const (the core of the MISRA check).\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND (macro/enum/constant): while not directly a pointer, its definition clarifies how kind is used; knowing its type can be relevant to whether kind must be modifiable and whether the header entries filtered by that bitmask are expected to be mutable or immutable.\n\n- Prototype of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: the parameter types and const-qualification show whether the function requires or promises not to modify the passed strings. If it accepts const char * for the buffer arguments, then passing non-const pointers is allowed but suggests the callee treats data as read-only (supporting const qualification of the source pointers).\n\n- Prototype of MHD_str_has_token_caseless_: same reason as above \u2014 its parameter constness and whether it modifies the buffers must be known to judge if the buffers (pos->value etc.) could be const.\n\n- All functions/places that create or modify MHD_HTTP_Req_Header instances or their header/value buffers (writers): to determine whether it is \"possible\" to declare header/value as pointers-to-const, we must know whether other code ever writes through those pointers or needs them mutable. Any allocator/parser/setter that assigns or mutates the header or value buffers is necessary to decide if const qualification would be feasible without breaking other code.\n\nTogether, these symbols let an analyst determine the declared const-ness of relevant pointers, whether called helpers treat the data as read-only, and whether other code mutates the referenced buffers \u2014 the information required to assess compliance with the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
