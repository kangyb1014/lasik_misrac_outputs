Although MHD_HTTP_Req_Header::value has a value_size member, the call passes only pos->value (no explicit length), and MHD_lookup_header_token_ci does not verify that token_len matches the actual token buffer size. If MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ internally calls e.g. strstr(pos->value, token) or strlen(token) or uses memcpy/memcmp without length checks, and either pos->value is not NUL-terminated or token_len exceeds the actual token buffer, the invoked string-handling code could read beyond the objects\u2019 bounds (violating Rule 21.17).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_lookup_header_token_ci:\nstruct MHD_Connection\n{\n\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextE;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevE;\n#endif\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   * This DLL can be either the\n   * 'manual_timeout_head/manual_timeout_tail' or the\n   * 'normal_timeout_head/normal_timeout_tail', depending on whether a\n   * custom timeout is set for the connection.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextX;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevX;\n\n  /**\n   * Reference to the MHD_Daemon struct.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;\n\n  /**\n   * Request-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Request rq;\n\n  /**\n   * Reply-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Reply rp;\n\n  /**\n   * The memory pool is created whenever we first read from the TCP\n   * stream and destroyed at the end of each request (and re-created\n   * for the next request).

  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA Rule 21.17 concerns the use of <string.h> functions that can read/write beyond object bounds. The code shown (MHD_lookup_header_token_ci) does not itself call any <string.h> functions \u2014 it only calls helper functions (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ and MHD_str_has_token_caseless_). A possible out\u2011of\u2011bounds read would be a defect in the implementation of those helpers, not in MHD_lookup_header_token_ci itself. Moreover, the MHD_HTTP_Req_Header comments state that value_size is \u201cthe length of the value, not including the final zero termination,\u201d which documents that pos->value is NUL\u2011terminated; that makes passing pos->value to string routines safe in the usual C sense. Without the implementation of MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ showing use of string.h functions that ignore buffer lengths (e.g. calling strlen/strstr on non\u2011terminated data), the report is speculative. Therefore the claim that this function violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is not supported by the provided code."
