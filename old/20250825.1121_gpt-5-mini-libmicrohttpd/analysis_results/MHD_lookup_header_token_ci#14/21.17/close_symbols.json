  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_lookup_header_token_ci can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses by string functions, the analyzer needs the concrete types, storage and invariants for the buffers and the actual implementations (or contracts) of the called string helpers:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: required to know layout and lifetime of the connection object and how its rq.headers_received list is reached.\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: required to know types and semantics of its fields (header_size, header, value, next, kind) so we can reason about buffer sizes and pointer validity.\n- connection->rq.headers_received: the actual list head symbol so we can follow where entries come from and their lifetimes.\n- pos->header_size: needed to know the meaning/unit of header_size (number of bytes, includes/excludes NUL), since the function compares header_len to this value before calling string helpers.\n- pos->header: the pointer compared/called into MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ \u2014 we must know the allocated size and termination guarantees for this buffer to check bounds when read for header_len bytes or when helper assumes NUL termination.\n- pos->value: passed to MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ \u2014 we must know whether this buffer is NUL\u2011terminated or bounded and its allocated size to ensure scanning/token search cannot read past its end.\n- pos->next: to understand list traversal and possible NULL or stale pointers (lifetime/ownership issues relevant to safe access).\n- pos->kind and MHD_HEADER_KIND: to understand the branch that filters entries (ensures we only examine header entries) and whether that implies any additional invariants about header/value storage.\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: the implementation or precise contract is required to know whether it only reads exactly the requested length (header_len) and does not rely on NUL termination or read beyond the provided length.\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_: its implementation/contract is required to know how it scans pos->value and token/token_len \u2014 whether it bounds reads by token_len, requires NUL termination, or can run past pos->value's buffer.\n- All functions/locations that allocate or populate MHD_HTTP_Req_Header entries: the parser/storage code that sets header_size, header and value is essential to verify that header buffers have at least header_size bytes (and whether a terminating NUL is present or absent), and that value buffers are properly sized/terminated. Without those allocation/population invariants you cannot conclude that the string helpers will not read beyond the buffers.\n\nTogether these symbols allow checking (a) that header_len == pos->header_size implies pos->header points to at least header_len bytes, (b) that MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ reads only those bytes or otherwise is safe, and (c) that MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ only reads within pos->value's allocated bounds. Without any one of these definitions/implementations you cannot determine compliance with the <string.h> bounds rule."
