  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if the MISRA rule is violated:\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: This function is directly called by the target function to compare header names. You must inspect its implementation/prototype to see whether it uses the C standard library function memcmp on null-terminated strings (or otherwise misuses memcmp). If it uses memcmp only on binary buffers with explicit lengths, it may be fine; if it calls memcmp on NUL-terminated strings, that would violate the rule.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_: This function is called to check for a token inside pos->value. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it uses memcmp (or another forbidden comparison) on null-terminated header value strings. Token-search helpers sometimes use memcmp for substring matches; confirm how lengths and NUL-termination are handled.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The code accesses fields pos->header, pos->header_size, pos->value, pos->kind and pos->next. You need the struct definition to determine whether pos->header and pos->value are NUL-terminated C strings or binary buffers and whether header_size counts the terminating NUL. That affects whether passing their lengths to any memcmp-based helpers would constitute comparing NUL-terminated strings with memcmp.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function reads connection->rq.headers_received. You need the connection/request layout to confirm how headers_received is populated and what invariants hold for header and value fields (e.g., guaranteed NUL-termination or buffer lengths), which impacts whether memcmp is being used on NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND: The code masks pos->kind with MHD_HEADER_KIND. Understanding this macro/constant is necessary to know which header records are examined and whether their fields follow different invariants (some header kinds might store data differently, e.g., binary headers vs. text headers), which can affect whether memcmp is used incorrectly.\n\n- keepalive_possible: This caller supplies the header, header_len, token, token_len arguments to MHD_lookup_header_token_ci. Inspecting keepalive_possible shows how those lengths are computed (e.g., via strlen or explicit buffer lengths). If caller passes strlen(...) as header_len/token_len, that indicates the function is often used with NUL-terminated strings, increasing risk that downstream memcmp usage would be on NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets the standard memcmp. You must locate actual uses of memcmp (direct calls or via wrappers) inside the helper functions above to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare NUL-terminated strings. Include the memcmp symbol so the analyzer can find any direct or indirect calls and judge compliance.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst (a) inspect helper implementations for memcmp usage, (b) determine whether the data being compared are NUL-terminated strings or binary buffers, and (c) check how callers compute lengths\u2014so they can conclude whether the target function (including its callees) violates the MISRA C rule about memcmp on null-terminated strings."
