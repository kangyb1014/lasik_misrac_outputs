  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The target accesses connection and its member rq. To check for language extensions you must inspect the actual struct declaration (e.g. anonymous/embedded structs/unions, GCC attributes, nonstandard pragmas or layout directives) and any unusual typedefs used for the type.\n\n- type of connection->rq (the struct that contains headers_received): The code dereferences connection->rq.headers_received; the rq type definition may itself use anonymous structs/unions, flexible array members, bit-fields, or compiler-specific attributes \u2014 all potential language extensions that must be inspected.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop iterates over and reads pos->kind, pos->header_size, pos->header, pos->value and pos->next. You must see the full declaration to detect any use of compiler extensions (anonymous fields, bit-field widths using nonstandard syntax, GCC attributes on members, packed/unaligned layouts, nonstandard pointer types, etc.).\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND (macro or enum): This macro/constant is used in an expression (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND). Its definition could hide language extensions (e.g. statement-expressions, typeof, compound literals, token-pasting tricks, compiler-specific attributes). The exact macro/enum must be checked.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (declaration/definition): The function is called from the target; its prototype or definition may use language extensions in its signature (inline, __attribute__ annotations, typeof in parameters, nonstandard calling conventions) or in its implementation (statement expressions, nested functions, asm), so you must examine it to rule out extensions.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (declaration/definition): Same rationale as above \u2014 both the prototype and implementation must be inspected for any compiler-specific extensions or nonstandard language constructs.\n\nNote: Standard types used in the function (char*, size_t, NULL, bool/_Bool) are normal C types; you only need their headers if their declarations in the codebase introduce nonstandard typedefs or macros. The symbols above cover all user-defined types, macros and functions that could hide language extensions relevant to MISRA\u2019s prohibition on compiler-specific language extensions."
