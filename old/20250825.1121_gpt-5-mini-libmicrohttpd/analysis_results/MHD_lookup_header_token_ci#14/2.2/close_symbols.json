  "explanation": "To decide whether MHD_lookup_header_token_ci is dead code (i.e., can be removed without changing program behaviour) we must know both reachability (is it ever called) and whether its internal operations have observable side effects. Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- keepalive_possible: The static call graph shows this function calls MHD_lookup_header_token_ci. We must inspect keepalive_possible to determine whether it is ever invoked in normal program flow and whether the value returned from MHD_lookup_header_token_ci affects program behaviour (i.e., used in control flow, I/O, timing, or observable state changes).\n\n- setup_reply_properties: keepalive_possible is called by setup_reply_properties (per the call graph). We need to trace this caller chain to determine overall reachability from entry points; knowing how setup_reply_properties is used (and whether it is reachable/conditionally compiled) is necessary to decide if MHD_lookup_header_token_ci is effectively unused.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: This helper is invoked inside the target. To determine if removing MHD_lookup_header_token_ci changes behaviour we must know whether this helper has side effects (modifies memory, global state, logging, errno, timing, etc.) or purely returns a value. If it has observable side effects then the call cannot be removed without altering behaviour.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_: Same reason as above \u2014 it is called inside the function. Its side\u2011effects or observable behaviour must be known to judge whether the call is removable.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function takes a pointer to this type and reads connection->rq.headers_received. We need the definition to know the layout and whether reading the pointer could have side effects, and to understand the semantics of rq and how instances are created/used (impacting reachability and effect of removing the function).\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop walks a linked list of these nodes and reads fields (kind, header_size, header, value, next). The structure definition (and any invariants) is required to determine whether the loop can ever execute, whether the conditionals can ever be true, and whether reading these fields has side effects (e.g., lazy population, reference counting, locking) that would be lost if the function were removed.\n\n- connection->rq.headers_received (where it is set/populated): Knowing where and how the headers_received list is populated (parsing code, initialization paths) is essential to decide if the function's loop can ever execute or ever find a matching header. If headers_received is never populated in reachable code paths, the function may be dead. Conversely, if the population code depends on runtime conditions, removal may change observable behaviour.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND (macro / constant): The conditional checks (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND) gate the remainder of the test. We need the definition/value to determine whether that test can be true for nodes in the list, and whether that expression has side effects (unlikely, but the macro could expand to function calls or volatile accesses in pathological cases).\n\nIn short, to decide MISRA's dead\u2011code rule for this function we must (a) prove that no reachable call chain invokes it (so include its callers up the chain), and (b) confirm that the calls and member reads inside it have no observable side effects (so include the helper functions, the involved structures, the list population code, and the flag macro)."
