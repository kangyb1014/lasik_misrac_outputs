  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_lookup_header_token_ci violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect recursion you must examine the call graph beyond the single function. Explanations:\n\n- keepalive_possible (definition): keepalive_possible is a caller of MHD_lookup_header_token_ci (per the static call graph). You must inspect its body to see whether it calls MHD_lookup_header_token_ci (directly) or calls other functions that could eventually call MHD_lookup_header_token_ci (indirect recursion).\n\n- setup_reply_properties (definition): setup_reply_properties is listed as a caller of keepalive_possible. You must inspect it to determine whether there exists a call path from setup_reply_properties \u2192 ... \u2192 MHD_lookup_header_token_ci (i.e., an indirect recursion path back to the target).\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (definition): This function is called by the target. To prove absence of recursion you must ensure these helper functions do not call MHD_lookup_header_token_ci (directly or via other calls).\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (definition): Same reason as above \u2014 it is called by the target and must be checked for any call paths back to the target.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (type/definition): Inspect the connection structure to see whether it contains function pointers or callbacks that could be invoked (in keepalive_possible, setup_reply_properties, or elsewhere) and that might call MHD_lookup_header_token_ci, creating an indirect recursion path.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header (type/definition): Likewise, header node definitions could embed callbacks or carry pointers used by other functions; check for any members that could produce call-backs into MHD_lookup_header_token_ci.\n\n- Any functions called (directly or indirectly) by keepalive_possible and setup_reply_properties (definitions): If keepalive_possible or setup_reply_properties call additional functions, those must be examined as well for any path that returns to MHD_lookup_header_token_ci. In short, you need the full set of definitions along the call chains originating from these functions to conclusively rule out indirect recursion.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their prototypes/definitions and any callees they invoke) allows a complete analysis of possible call paths and thus whether the target participates in direct or indirect recursion."
