  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: The function indexes into connection->rq and reads headers_received; to determine reachability of the for-loop and early-return checks you must know the layout and semantic invariants of MHD_Connection (whether rq or headers_received can ever be non-NULL/NULL, initialization rules, or if connection is guaranteed non-NULL by callers).\n\n- struct MHD_Connection::rq (member): The rq sub-structure contains the headers_received pointer. You need its definition to know the type and possible values/initialization of headers_received that control whether the loop body is reachable.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: The loop iterates over objects of this type and reads fields pos->next, pos->kind, pos->header_size, pos->header and pos->value. Their types and any invariants (e.g. header_size ranges, whether header/value pointers can be NULL, next linkage) are required to decide which branches in the loop can ever be taken.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND (macro/constant): The expression (pos->kind & MHD_HEADER_KIND) determines whether the if-condition inside the loop can be true. You must know the value/meaning of this macro and how pos->kind is set to decide reachability of the inner branch.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (function): The condition uses this helper on header and pos->header. Its signature and semantics (return values for given inputs, whether it can have side-effects that influence reachability) are needed to determine if the second comparison arm can be true and thus if the overall if can be true.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (function): Likewise this helper is used in the final conjunct; its semantics and possible return values (for given pos->value, token, token_len) are required to determine whether the if-condition can ever evaluate to true.\n\n- keepalive_possible (caller): This is the direct caller shown in the static call graph. To judge whether any code paths in MHD_lookup_header_token_ci are unreachable in practice you must inspect how keepalive_possible calls it (what arguments it passes, whether it ensures non-NULL pointers or particular header/token values), since caller invariants can make branches dead.\n\n- setup_reply_properties (indirect caller): keepalive_possible itself is called by higher-level code (setup_reply_properties as shown). Tracing caller chains and their guarantees may be necessary to prove that certain checks in MHD_lookup_header_token_ci are always true/false, making parts of the function unreachable.\n\nNote: to prove/unprove MISRA's unreachable-code requirement you will often need the initialization/assignment sites for headers_received and pos->kind and the call sites that produce header/header_len/token/token_len values; the symbols listed above are the minimal set that exposes those fields, macros and callers needed for that analysis."
