  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: c->read_buffer is a pointer to a mutable buffer (it is reallocated and used for read/write offsets), so it cannot be const-qualified. The fragment only passes that pointer to a function; there is no evidence the pointed-to object could be const. (A violation would occur if the buffer contents were never modified and the function parameter or the struct member could/should be declared as pointer to const \u2014 then the non-const pointer use would breach Rule 8.13.)"
