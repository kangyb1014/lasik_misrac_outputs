  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. c->write_buffer is a mutable buffer (char *) that is written to (append/send offsets are adjusted) and is being reallocated; therefore it cannot be const-qualified. A violation would occur if the object were never modified and the function(s) accessing it did not need a mutable pointer \u2014 e.g. if the buffer were read-only and MHD_pool_reallocate and other callers never modify the pointed-to bytes, then the pointer type should be const and using a non-const pointer would breach Rule 8.13."
