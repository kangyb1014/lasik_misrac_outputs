  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function appear to be invariant. Each conditional depends on variables or function results that can vary at runtime: \n- if (NULL != res): 'res' is assigned by MHD_pool_try_alloc and may be NULL or non-NULL. \n- if (MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (pool, c->write_buffer, c->write_buffer_size)): result depends on runtime state of 'pool' and buffer parameters (function call). \n- if (c->write_buffer_size - c->write_buffer_append_offset >= need_to_be_freed): depends on c->write_buffer_size, c->write_buffer_append_offset and need_to_be_freed (set by previous call). \n- else if (MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (pool, c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_size)): function call depending on 'pool' and read buffer values. \n- if (c->read_buffer_size - c->read_buffer_offset >= need_to_be_freed): depends on runtime fields. \nThere are no loops with constant controlling expressions (no for/while/do-while with invariant conditions) and none of the if/else conditions are compile-time or semantically constant. The mhd_assert calls are not control-flow statements. Therefore, there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
