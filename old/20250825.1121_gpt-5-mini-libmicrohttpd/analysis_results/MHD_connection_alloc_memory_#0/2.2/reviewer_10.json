Thus the assertion performs a runtime check that can never fail and has no effect on program behaviour; removing it would not change behaviour. As an executed, redundant operation it constitutes dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. The apparent algebraic implication c->read_buffer_offset <= new_buf_size from the earlier test is only valid under the implicit assumption that the intermediate unsigned arithmetic does not wrap and that the usual integer algebraic manipulations apply. In C these operands are size_t (unsigned) and arithmetic is modulo 2^N; the simple integer rearrangement (a - b >= c  =>  a - c >= b) relies on there being no wrap/overflow when adding/subtracting the terms. That property is not established by the code prior to the assertion, so the assertion is not provably redundant in general C semantics. Furthermore, mhd_assert may have observable effects (logging/abort) in some builds and may be intended to document/check an invariant for diagnostics or static analysis; removing it could change behaviour in those builds. Because of these reasons the assertion cannot be deemed dead code for the purposes of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so the reported violation is incorrect."
