The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were reviewed and are not suspected dead code because they are essential to program behavior or are clearly conditional/return paths that affect control flow. Specifically:\n- The aliasing declarations (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; and struct MemoryPool *const pool = c->pool;) are used throughout the function and are not redundant.\n- The initial allocation attempt (res = MHD_pool_try_alloc (pool, size, &need_to_be_freed); and its immediate NULL check) is the primary allocation path and must remain.\n- The calls to MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace(...) and their surrounding if/else logic determine which buffer (write/read) to shrink and include necessary checks on available space; these conditionals and size calculations influence control flow and are not dead.\n- The arithmetic that computes new buffer sizes and the subsequent updates to c->*_size fields are required to maintain correct buffer state.\n- The final allocation call (res = MHD_pool_allocate (pool, size, true);) and the subsequent return are the intended allocation completion path and cannot be removed.\n- Variable declarations such as res and buf are used after initialization and are therefore live.\n\nThe fragments selected above are highlighted because they are potential candidates for being redundant or effectively no-ops in some build/configuration scenarios (for example: assertions that may compile out, assignments that reassign an identical value, initializations that may be overwritten before use, repeated reallocation calls that always return the same pointer, and multiple identical 'return NULL' branches). These should be investigated to determine whether they constitute dead code according to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
