  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 targets operations that are executed in the project but whose removal would not alter program behaviour. An assertion macro such as mhd_assert is normally a diagnostic that in some builds expands to code that can alter behaviour (e.g. abort, log, or side-effect checks) and in other builds (release) may be defined away. Because the assertion can be active in some project build configurations, it is not (in general) an operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so it is not dead code under Rule 2.2. \n\nIf, however, the project policy guarantees that mhd_assert is globally defined as a no-op in every build configuration (e.g. always ((void)0)), then those assertion statements would have no effect and could be considered redundant. In that specific, constrained situation a tool might flag them, but the agent A's general claim that the shown code violates Rule 2.2 is not correct for the usual case where assertions may be enabled in some builds."
