  "explanation": "I selected all conditional branches and return points that determine whether the function falls through to the final allocation or returns early. These are the places where unreachable code is most likely to occur (mutually exclusive branches, early returns, and the final code path that assumes prior checks).\n\nOther parts of the function do not need investigation for unreachable-code concerns: the initial aliasing declarations (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; struct MemoryPool *const pool = c->pool; size_t need_to_be_freed = 0; void *res;) are simple initialisations and are reachable whenever the function is called. The call to MHD_pool_try_alloc and the assignment to need_to_be_freed are included only via the first selected fragment (the immediate return on non-NULL res); no other isolated statements present in the code are inherently unreachable. The individual mhd_assert() calls that appear inside the selected blocks are included within those blocks for inspection; there are no other standalone statements or labels outside these blocks that are syntactically unreachable and therefore do not require further investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1."
