  "explanation": "The function parameters are: (1) struct MHD_Connection *connection and (2) size_t size. The code does not assign to or modify the parameter variables themselves. Instead, the code creates a local alias pointer: 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;', where 'c' is a const pointer (the pointer value cannot be changed) to the same object \u2014 this prevents modification of the pointer variable. All subsequent assignments (for example, c->write_buffer_size = new_buf_size; c->write_buffer = buf; c->read_buffer_size = new_buf_size; c->read_buffer = buf;) modify members of the object pointed to by the parameter, which is permitted by Rule 17.8. The size parameter is never assigned to or altered. No statements increment, reassign or otherwise change the parameter variables 'connection' or 'size'. Calling functions with members of the pointed-to object or with pool does not modify the pointer parameter itself. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
