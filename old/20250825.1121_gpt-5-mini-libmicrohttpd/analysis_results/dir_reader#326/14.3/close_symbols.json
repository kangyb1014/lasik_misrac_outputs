  "explanation": "To decide if the controlling expression \"e->d_name[0] == '.'\" is an invariant (for MISRA\u2019s rule) you must know whether the expression can change between iterations. The following symbols/documentation are required:\n\n- readdir: Its prototype and behaviour determine what value 'e' gets on each iteration. If readdir returns successive directory entries then the condition depends on changing data; if it were to always return the same unchanging entry the condition could be invariant.\n\n- DIR: The directory stream type passed to readdir; understanding it confirms that readdir advances the stream associated with this DIR and that repeated calls are intended to return successive entries for that stream.\n\n- struct dirent: The definition is needed to know that 'e' points to a dirent object and what fields exist (particularly d_name) so the controlling expression is well\u2011formed.\n\n- struct dirent.d_name (type/representation and NUL-termination): You must confirm d_name is a character array (NUL\u2011terminated string) so that indexing d_name[0] is valid and meaningful and that its contents can change between readdir calls.\n\n- readdir semantics (advances directory stream, returns NULL at end, may reuse static storage but updates contents): Important details include that readdir advances the directory position and returns NULL at end-of-stream. Notably, many implementations reuse a single internal buffer and return a pointer to it; the pointer value may be the same across calls while its contents change. This distinction determines whether the controlling expression is dependent on mutable data (non-invariant) or truly constant.\n\n- do-while loop evaluation semantics (condition evaluated after loop body): Language semantics confirm the controlling expression is evaluated after the loop body and so will observe any changes made by the body (notably the assignment from readdir) \u2014 relevant to whether the controller is invariant.\n\nIncluding these symbols/semantics in the next-agent prompt lets that agent determine whether e->d_name[0] == '.' can change across iterations (so is not an invariant), or whether circumstances could make it invariant (e.g. a pathological readdir implementation or external conditions), and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated or an exception applies."
