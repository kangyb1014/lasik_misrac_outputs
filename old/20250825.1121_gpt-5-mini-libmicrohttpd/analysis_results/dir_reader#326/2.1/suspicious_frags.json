  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not appear to be unreachable and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 2.1: the do { e = readdir(dir); if (e == NULL) return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM; } while (e->d_name[0] == '.'); loop is reachable (it advances via readdir and will exit on EOF or a non-dot entry); the final return (ssize_t) res is reachable after snprintf when neither error/truncation conditions occur; the (void) pos; line is merely a suppression of an unused-parameter warning and is not unreachable code; variable declarations and the function signature are obviously reachable context. The selected fragments are included because the early return on max < 512 and the two snprintf-related error checks warrant investigation for potential guaranteed/unreachable outcomes (e.g. platform filename length limits, guarantees about snprintf return values, or calling conventions that always pass max >= 512) which could make those branches effectively unreachable."
