  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) pos; idiom is an explicit, standard way to indicate an intentionally unused parameter and to suppress compiler warnings. Although it has no effect on program semantics at runtime (and a compiler will typically optimize it away), it is not what MISRA intends to forbid with Rule 2.2 (dead code) in the sense of unintended leftover operations that should be removed. In practice MISRA guidance accepts the use of such idioms to document and suppress unused-parameter diagnostics (or you can omit the parameter name in a prototype, or use a compiler-specific \"unused\" attribute). If you wanted to avoid any possible interpretation, you can remove the parameter name from the declaration/definition where allowed or use a standardized annotation, but the agent A's claim that this statement violates Rule 2.2 is not correct."
