  "explanation": "Provide these symbols so the next analyst can determine whether this function (or things it directly calls) performs a memcmp-based comparison of a null-terminated string:\n\n- memcmp: the exact standard-library symbol the MISRA rule forbids for comparing null-terminated strings. Must be checked for direct use in this function.\n- bcmp: historical/alternative byte-compare function that may be used in place of memcmp; include to detect equivalent forbidden comparisons.\n- __builtin_memcmp: compiler intrinsic that may be used instead of memcmp (or generated by macros); include to detect indirect uses.\n- readdir: this function is called to obtain the struct dirent pointer. The implementation of readdir (or wrappers around it) must be inspected to ensure it does not perform memcmp on d_name (or that the returned name is indeed a null-terminated string).\n- struct dirent: needed to inspect the declaration and semantics of its d_name member (size, whether it is NUL-terminated). The MISRA issue concerns comparing null-terminated strings, so knowing whether d_name is a NUL-terminated string is essential.\n- d_name: the field actually used in the function; include to confirm it is a null-terminated filename (and therefore would make a memcmp-based comparison a MISRA violation).\n- DIR: the type of cls; include to check whether cls may be some wrapped object whose methods might perform forbidden comparisons.\n- snprintf: included because it writes into buf using e->d_name; confirming snprintf's behavior with respect to NUL-termination and return semantics helps rule out hidden comparisons or misinterpretation of buffer contents.\n\nNote: The goal is to detect any direct or indirect use of memcmp (or equivalents) to compare e->d_name (or other null-terminated strings produced/consumed here). The above symbols allow checking (1) whether memcmp or equivalents are called in this function, (2) whether any called routines (readdir, wrappers) might call memcmp on d_name, and (3) whether d_name is a NUL-terminated string (the crux of the MISRA prohibition)."
