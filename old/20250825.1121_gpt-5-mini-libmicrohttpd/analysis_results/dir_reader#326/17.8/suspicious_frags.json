  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The function only reads parameters and copies the void* cls into a local DIR* variable (DIR *dir = cls;) \u2014 that does not modify the parameter itself. The (void) pos; line explicitly ignores pos without changing it. Calls that alter objects reachable through pointer parameters (readdir(dir) modifies the DIR object; snprintf(buf, ...) writes into the object pointed to by buf) are permitted by Rule 17.8 because the rule allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter so long as the pointer parameter itself is not assigned to. There are no assignments to cls, pos, buf, or max, so no fragments need further investigation under Rule 17.8."
