  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (a function parameter shall not be modified) we must know which of the referenced symbols could change the parameter variables themselves or only the objects they point to:\n\n- DIR: to confirm the type of 'dir' (obtained from the parameter 'cls') and whether operations on DIR would require passing a pointer-to-pointer (which could modify the parameter variable) or a pointer. Needed to verify that 'DIR *dir = cls;' does not modify the parameter variable 'cls'.\n\n- struct dirent: to know the type returned by readdir and whether accessing its members could imply hidden pointer reassignment. Ensures e is a pointer to a struct and that e->... accesses do not write back into parameter variables.\n\n- d_name (member of struct dirent): to determine the type of d_name (char array vs char *). This clarifies whether e->d_name is an lvalue that could cause writes to affect the pointer parameter (it affects the buffer pointed to by 'buf' when copied into the formatted string, but does not modify the pointer parameters themselves).\n\n- readdir: its prototype (struct dirent *readdir(DIR *)) is needed to confirm it takes a DIR * (not DIR **), i.e. it may modify the DIR object state but cannot change the pointer variable passed into dir_reader. This distinction is central to the MISRA question (modifying the object pointed to is allowed; changing the pointer parameter is not).\n\n- snprintf: prototype (int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...)) is required to show it writes into the buffer pointed to by 'buf' (allowed \u2014 it modifies the pointed-to object) and that it does not modify the pointer variable 'buf' itself.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: definitions/type (likely ssize_t constants/macros) are needed to ensure these are scalar return sentinels and not macros or functions that could have side effects modifying parameters.\n\n- ssize_t: the return type used by the function; required to interpret the sentinel macros' types and to ensure no hidden pointer manipulation via casts/returns.\n\n- size_t: to confirm the signed/unsigned width used in comparisons and the snprintf size argument; ensures comparisons/assignments do not imply modification of the parameter variable 'max'.\n\n- uint64_t: to confirm the type of 'pos' and that uses like '(void) pos;' do not implicitly modify the parameter.\n\nIn short: these symbols let an analyst confirm the signatures and types of external functions/macros used here and determine whether any of them could modify the parameter variables (they do not)."
