  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses standard C constructs (static function, do/while, casts, (void) to silence unused variable), standard library function snprintf, and POSIX API types/functions (ssize_t, readdir, struct dirent). uint64_t is from C99 stdint.h. The MHD_CONTENT_READER_* macros are simple casts to ssize_t, not compiler-specific extensions. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific extensions present (for example: __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions, inline assembler, nested functions, __declspec, or other documented compiler-only keywords). Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
