  "explanation": "To determine whether dir_reader calls itself (directly or indirectly) you must inspect every symbol it invokes and every place it is installed as a callback because recursion can occur via called functions or via callbacks into the same code path. For each listed symbol: \n- readdir: dir_reader calls readdir(dir). You must examine readdir's implementation/call graph (or any wrapper used in the project) to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call dir_reader. If readdir is replaced/wrapped in the project, that wrapper must be analyzed as well.\n- snprintf: dir_reader calls snprintf. Inspect snprintf's implementation/call graph (or any project-provided replacement) to ensure it cannot lead back to dir_reader.\n- DIR (type definition): The DIR type may be a handle to library code; its definition lets you check for embedded function pointers or custom implementations that could cause callbacks into user code including dir_reader.\n- struct dirent (definition): Access to e->d_name is used; ensure the struct does not contain function pointers or custom behavior in this build that could cause callbacks into dir_reader.\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: These are return-value symbols \u2014 confirm they are simple constants/macros and not function-like macros or wrappers that would call code leading to dir_reader.\n- Any code that registers dir_reader as a callback (e.g. MHD_create_response_from_callback): If dir_reader is invoked by an HTTP server loop or other framework, examine the registration and the framework's call graph to ensure that any functions called from dir_reader (or library functions it calls) cannot re-enter the framework in a way that results in dir_reader being called again (indirect recursion).\n\nInclude the implementations or call-graph edges for the above symbols (or confirmation they are standard library/simple constants) when analyzing for MISRA recursion violations."
