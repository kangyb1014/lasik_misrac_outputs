  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: snprintf is not one of the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, and snprintf itself will not write beyond buf because it is given the size (max). Additionally, e->d_name as returned by readdir is a NUL-terminated string on POSIX systems, so snprintf will only read up to that terminator. (A hypothetical violation could occur on a non\u2011conforming implementation where e->d_name is not NUL\u2011terminated \u2014 then reading with %s could access beyond the object bounds.)"
