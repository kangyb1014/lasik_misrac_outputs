  "scenario": "snprintf returns the number of characters that would have been written. If res == max the output was truncated (res >= max indicates truncation) but the code tests only max < (size_t)res, so it fails to detect the res == max case. The function then returns res (the would-be length) while only max-1 bytes plus a NUL were actually written into buf; a caller that uses the returned length may read past the buffer bounds, causing an out-of-bounds access."
