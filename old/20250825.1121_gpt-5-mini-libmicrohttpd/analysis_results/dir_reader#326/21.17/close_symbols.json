This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "snprintf: You must know the exact semantics of snprintf \u2014 how many bytes it writes into the destination buffer, whether it always NUL-terminates, and what its return value represents (number of characters that would have been written, excluding the terminating NUL, or negative on encoding error). The code relies on snprintf to avoid writing past buf and uses the returned value to detect truncated output; correct interpretation of res and truncation conditions depends on the standard-specified behavior of snprintf.\n\nstruct dirent::d_name: The code reads e->d_name with the \"%s\" format. To determine whether that read can access beyond the object bounds you need the concrete definition of struct dirent on the target platform (the type and size of d_name and whether the implementation guarantees a terminating NUL). If d_name is not properly NUL-terminated or can be longer than expected, \"%s\" (and thus snprintf) could read out of bounds.\n\nreaddir and DIR: You need readdir's contract (what it fills in struct dirent, whether d_name is guaranteed NUL-terminated, whether the returned pointer points to thread-local/static storage or allocated memory and its lifetime). That affects whether reading e->d_name is valid and for how long the data remains valid.\n\nNAME_MAX (or platform filename-length limit): Knowing the maximum possible filename length on the platform gives an upper bound on strlen(e->d_name) and therefore on the maximum snprintf result (the formatted size = fixed overhead + 2 * strlen(d_name)). This bound is needed to prove whether the check (max < (size_t)res) and the early return when max < 512 are sufficient to prevent out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n\nsize_t and ssize_t definitions: The analysis uses comparisons and casts involving size_t and ssize_t (max and return value). Confirming their widths and signedness prevents integer conversion/overflow mistakes in the bounds checks and in interpreting snprintf's return value.\n\n(Other symbols in the function such as MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM / MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR are control-flow markers but are not required to reason about string/buffer bounds.)"
