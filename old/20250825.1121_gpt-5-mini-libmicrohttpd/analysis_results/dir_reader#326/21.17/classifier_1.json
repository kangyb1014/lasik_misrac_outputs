  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation \u2014 the fragment only indexes the first character of e->d_name (e->d_name[0]) and does not call any functions from <string.h>. readdir() provides a dirent with a valid, null\u2011terminated d_name, so accessing element 0 is well defined. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 applies to use of <string.h> functions and is not triggered by this code. (A rule 21.17 violation would occur only if a string.h function were used in a way that accesses beyond the bounds of the object.)"
