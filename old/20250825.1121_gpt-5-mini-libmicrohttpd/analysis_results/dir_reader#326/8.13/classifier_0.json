  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The pointer 'e' is declared as 'struct dirent *e' and its member e->d_name (a char array / char *) is used only for read-only purposes when passed to snprintf. According to Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible. Here 'e' (and/or the name pointer) could be declared as 'const struct dirent *e' or 'const char *name = e->d_name' to reflect that the data is not modified. Because the code uses a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer is possible, the rule is violated."
