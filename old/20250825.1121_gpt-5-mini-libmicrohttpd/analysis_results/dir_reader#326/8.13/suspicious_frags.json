  "explanation": "Other pointer occurrences in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter 'void *cls' is used as a DIR* (the DIR object is modified by readdir), so the pointed-to type cannot be const; the local 'DIR *dir = cls;' is used with readdir which modifies DIR state and thus cannot be const-qualified; the buffer parameter 'char *buf' is written into (snprintf), so its pointee cannot be const. No other pointer declarations are present that could be const-qualified without changing semantics, so they are not reported."
