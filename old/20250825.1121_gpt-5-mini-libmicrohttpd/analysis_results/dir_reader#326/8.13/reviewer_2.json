According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be declared const-qualified (e.g. 'const struct dirent *e') whenever possible. Assigning the non-const result of readdir to a const-qualified pointer is permitted, so the current non-const declaration is a violation.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function dir_reader:\n#define MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM ((ssize_t)-1)\n...\n#define MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR ((ssize_t)-2)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In dir_reader the local pointer 'e' is only used for read-only access (e->d_name) and thus should be const-qualified per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The assignment from readdir (which returns struct dirent *) to a pointer to const (const struct dirent *) is permitted by C, so declaring\n  const struct dirent *e;\nwould satisfy the rule. (Other, unrelated MISRA considerations \u2014 e.g. varargs usage with %s and qualifier interaction \u2014 are outside the scope of this specific Rule 8.13 check.)"
