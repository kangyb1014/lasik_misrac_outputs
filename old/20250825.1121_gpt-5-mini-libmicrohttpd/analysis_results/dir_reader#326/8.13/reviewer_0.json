True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe pointer 'e' is declared as 'struct dirent *e' and its member e->d_name (a char array / char *) is used only for read-only purposes when passed to snprintf. According to Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible. Here 'e' (and/or the name pointer) could be declared as 'const struct dirent *e' or 'const char *name = e->d_name' to reflect that the data is not modified. Because the code uses a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer is possible, the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function dir_reader:\n#define MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM ((ssize_t)-1)\n...\n#define MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR ((ssize_t)-2)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer type be const\u2011qualified wherever possible. In the function e is only used for read\u2011access (its d_name is passed to snprintf), so it could and should be declared as a pointer to const, e.g. \"const struct dirent *e\" (or capture the name as \"const char *name = e->d_name\"). Assigning the result of readdir (struct dirent *) to const struct dirent * is a valid qualification conversion in C, so there is no API incompatibility preventing the change. Therefore the code as written (using struct dirent *e when a const qualification is possible) violates Rule 8.13."
