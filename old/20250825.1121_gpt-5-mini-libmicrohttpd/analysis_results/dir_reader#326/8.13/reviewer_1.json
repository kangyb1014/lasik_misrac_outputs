  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In dir_reader the local pointer e is only used to read data (e->d_name) and is never used to modify the object it points to. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so e should be declared as const struct dirent *e. Converting the result of readdir (struct dirent *) to const struct dirent * is allowed and expresses the read-only intent. (Note: Rule 8.13 is a \u201cshould\u201d guideline, so this is an advisory violation; if e later needed to be passed to an API requiring a non-const pointer that could be a justification for keeping it non-const.)"
