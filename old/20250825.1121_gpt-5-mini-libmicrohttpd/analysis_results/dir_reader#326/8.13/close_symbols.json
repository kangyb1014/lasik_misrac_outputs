  "explanation": "DIR \u2014 needed to know the concrete type of the cls parameter after the cast (DIR *dir). Whether DIR is an opaque/const-appropriate object or requires mutation by library calls affects whether cls should be a pointer-to-const.\n\nstruct dirent \u2014 required to inspect the type of the d_name member (char[] vs char * vs const char *) and to decide whether variables that point at returned directory entries (e) could/should be declared as pointers-to-const (e.g. const struct dirent *e or const char *name).\n\nreaddir \u2014 the prototype (return type and parameter types) is essential: it determines whether readdir returns a mutable struct dirent * or a const struct dirent *, and whether it takes a DIR * or const DIR *. That directly constrains whether cls/DIR * and the local e pointer can be const-qualified.\n\nsnprintf \u2014 the function prototype shows the expected qualification of format and string arguments (const char *format, ...). Knowing snprintf's signature helps determine whether passing e->d_name (which decays to char *) could be treated as a const-qualified pointer for the call and whether any const qualification would be compatible.\n\nMHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR \u2014 definitions/type of these return sentinels (usually ssize_t constants) are required to confirm that changes to pointer constness will not conflict with required return types or macros (not directly about pointer constness but needed to fully reason about the function's API/usage and whether altering pointer types would affect return semantics).\n\n(Implicitly assumed standard integer typedefs like ssize_t, size_t and uint64_t are available from standard headers; they do not affect pointer-const analysis beyond types shown.)"
