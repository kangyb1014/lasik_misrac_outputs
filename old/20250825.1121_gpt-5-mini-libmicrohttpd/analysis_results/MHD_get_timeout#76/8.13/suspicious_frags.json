  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in the function are not candidates for const-qualification and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 8.13: \u2022 The parameter 'timeout' is written to (assignments such as '*timeout = ULLONG_MAX;' and '*timeout = (MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG) t64;'), so it must refer to a non-const object. \u2022 The address '&t64' is passed to MHD_get_timeout64 and is an output location (local uint64_t), so it cannot be made const. No other pointer parameters or pointer-like objects appear in this function body that could be qualified const. The two fragments reported are the only locations where a pointer parameter might be eligible for const-qualification and thus warrant further investigation."
