  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_timeout participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine the transitive call graph starting from its callee MHD_get_timeout64 and any functions that MHD_get_timeout64 can call or that can call it back. The listed symbols are required because:\n- MHD_get_timeout64: direct callee of MHD_get_timeout; its body and callees must be inspected to see if any path returns to MHD_get_timeout.\n- MHD_DLOG: a callee of MHD_get_timeout64; while likely a logging utility, its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call MHD_get_timeout.\n- connection_get_wait: a callee of MHD_get_timeout64; its implementation may call other functions (potentially MHD_get_timeout) and must be analyzed for cycles.\n- MHD_get_timeout64s, get_timeout_millisec_, MHD_select, main: other functions that call MHD_get_timeout64 (per the static graph). They must be examined because they could introduce indirect cycles by calling MHD_get_timeout64 and then, via other calls, eventually calling back into MHD_get_timeout.\n\nIn short, to prove absence of recursion you need the full implementations (or accurate call graphs) of MHD_get_timeout64 and each of its listed callees and callers so you can follow all possible call chains and verify none lead back to MHD_get_timeout."
