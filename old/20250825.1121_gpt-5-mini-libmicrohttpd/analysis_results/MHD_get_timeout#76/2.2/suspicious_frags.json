Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining code in MHD_get_timeout and the referenced MHD_get_timeout64 implementation consists of normal control flow and assignments that are exercised at runtime (calls, returns, assignments of *timeout64 = 0, and the final return MHD_YES / MHD_NO). These parts are not candidate dead code because they are reachable and affect program behaviour depending on runtime conditions (e.g., daemon state, pending data, presence of connections). The only portions that need investigation relative to Rule 2.2 are the preprocessor-guarded block and related macros/definitions included above (which determine whether that block is ever compiled) and the stray struct declaration \u2014 the rest of the function logic is clearly reachable or intentionally returning and thus not dead code."
