  "explanation": "- MHD_get_timeout64: The function call at the top can cause an early return. To know whether the rest of MHD_get_timeout is reachable you must know whether this callee can ever return a value other than MHD_NO (and under what conditions). Static analysis needs the callee's possible return values/semantics.  \n- MHD_NO and MHD_YES: The function compares the callee result to MHD_NO and returns MHD_YES at the end; their values/meanings are required to determine whether the early-return path is possible and thus whether subsequent code is reachable.  \n- SIZEOF_UINT64_T and SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG: These preprocessor macros control whether the if/else block around the ULLONG_MAX check is compiled. Determining reachability of lines (compiled vs removed) depends on their numeric values.  \n- ULLONG_MAX: The conditional inside the compiled block uses ULLONG_MAX <= t64. Knowing the numeric value of ULLONG_MAX (from limits.h) is required to decide if that branch or its else can ever be taken.  \n- UINT64_MAX (or equivalent information about the maximum value of uint64_t): The runtime variable t64 is of type uint64_t; to decide whether the test ULLONG_MAX <= t64 can be always false/true you must know the maximum representable value of uint64_t. Comparing ULLONG_MAX and UINT64_MAX lets you determine if the if-test can ever be true.  \n- MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG typedef: The cast and assignment target type affect reasoning about ranges/truncation and are required to understand why the ULLONG_MAX clamp is present and whether either arm is meaningful/possible.  \n- uint64_t typedef/type description: You need the exact width/signedness of uint64_t (and whether it is the same underlying type as unsigned long long on the platform) to evaluate the relation between t64 range and ULLONG_MAX and thus decide if either branch is unreachable.  \nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine which lines are removed by preprocessing and whether either branch of the runtime if (ULLONG_MAX <= t64) (when compiled) or the code after the early-return can ever be executed, which is necessary to judge potential MISRA unreachable-code violations."
