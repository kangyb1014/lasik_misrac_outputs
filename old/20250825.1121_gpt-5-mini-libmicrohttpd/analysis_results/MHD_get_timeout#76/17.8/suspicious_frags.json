  "explanation": "The function parameters are 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' and 'MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG *timeout'. The code does not reassign either pointer parameter (no statements like 'timeout = ...', 'daemon = ...', pointer increments, or pointer arithmetic). The only modifications are to the object pointed to by 'timeout' via '*timeout = ...', which is permitted by Rule 17.8. Passing 'daemon' to MHD_get_timeout64 is also a use of the pointer, not a modification of the pointer parameter itself. Therefore there are no fragments that violate or require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
