  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed:\n- MHD_get_timeout64: The target directly calls this routine. To determine whether any string.h functions (memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc.) are used (and whether they could access out-of-bounds memory) we must inspect the full implementation of MHD_get_timeout64.\n- MHD_DLOG: Appears in the static call graph as a callee of MHD_get_timeout64; logging routines commonly use string functions (snprintf, strcpy, strlen, etc.). Analyze MHD_DLOG to see if it invokes any <string.h> functions and whether those calls are safe.\n- connection_get_wait: Also a callee of MHD_get_timeout64. Its implementation must be checked for any use of <string.h> functions that could violate bounds.\n- struct MHD_Daemon: The pointer parameter to MHD_get_timeout and MHD_get_timeout64 is a daemon pointer; the daemon structure layout and contained pointers/buffers are needed to reason about any string operations in callee functions that take or dereference fields from this struct.\n- MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG: The typedef/definition of this type is required to know its width/representation (used for the output parameter and cast) and whether any conversion could interact with buffer sizes in code paths that use string functions.\n- uint64_t: The local variable t64 is of this type; its width relative to MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG (and the macros below) determines which branch of the conditional compiles and whether any value-range logic could affect subsequent code that might use string functions.\n- SIZEOF_UINT64_T and SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG: These compile-time macros control the conditional compilation in the function. You must know their values to determine which code path is active and therefore which code needs to be inspected for string.h usage.\n- ULLONG_MAX: Used in the comparison when the conditional is active. The numeric comparison can affect control flow (which assignment is performed). Knowing its value is necessary to determine which branches execute and thus which callees/code paths to inspect for string function usage.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule under review concerns any use of standard string.h functions reachable from the target. Therefore the implementations of MHD_get_timeout64 and its callees (and the daemon structure and type/size macros that determine which code is compiled/executed) are necessary to determine if any string.h calls occur and whether they are safe."
