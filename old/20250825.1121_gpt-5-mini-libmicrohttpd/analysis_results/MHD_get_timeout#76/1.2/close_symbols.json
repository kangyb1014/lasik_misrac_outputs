  "explanation": "For determining whether the target function uses compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions/macros/types that could hide such extensions or non\u2011standard constructs:\n\n- _MHD_EXTERN: often expands to linkage/visibility attributes (for example __attribute__((visibility(...))) or __declspec(dllexport)). Need its definition to detect any compiler-specific extension usage.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and the enumerators MHD_NO, MHD_YES: the function compares/returns these. Their definition may use non\u2011standard enum underlying type specifiers or attributes (extension). You must inspect the enum definition to ensure no compiler extensions are used.\n\n- MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG: used as a type (and in a cast). It may be a typedef to a standard type (e.g. unsigned long long) or to a compiler extension (e.g. __uint128_t or a typedef using attributes). You need its definition to verify it is standard.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: the parameter type might carry compiler-specific annotations (attributes, packing) in its declaration. Inspecting its definition ensures there are no language extensions attached to the struct.\n\n- MHD_get_timeout64 (declaration/prototype): the called function might be declared with compiler-specific attributes (calling convention, visibility, attributes) or use non\u2011standard return/type declarations. You must see its prototype to detect such extensions.\n\n- uint64_t: the fixed-width integer type must come from stdint.h or an implementation extension. Verify its definition/headers to ensure it is the standard typedef and not a compiler extension.\n\n- SIZEOF_UINT64_T and SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG: these conditional macros control compilation of extension-sensitive code paths. You need their definitions (and values) to know which branch is active and whether platform/configuration introduces extension usage.\n\n- ULLONG_MAX: from limits.h; used in a comparison. Confirming this macro and its relation to the target typedefs ensures no non\u2011standard constant or extension is being relied upon.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their definitions or the headers that define them) lets the next analyst determine whether any compiler\u2011specific language extensions are used/hidden in the target function."
