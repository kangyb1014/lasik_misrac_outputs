The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- MHD_get_timeout64: Direct callee of MHD_get_timeout. Any for-loops inside this function are relevant because the MISRA rule treats the behaviour of a for-loop body as including functions it calls; also MHD_get_timeout64 itself might contain for-loops that must be checked for being well-formed.\\n- MHD_DLOG: A callee of MHD_get_timeout64 (per the static call graph). If MHD_get_timeout64 calls MHD_DLOG from inside a for-loop (or if MHD_DLOG contains for-loops called from a loop body), those loops must be inspected for the MISRA requirements.\\n- connection_get_wait: Another callee of MHD_get_timeout64. Same rationale as MHD_DLOG \u2014 any for-loops here (or calls it makes) affect whether loop bodies reachable from MHD_get_timeout are well-formed.\\nNote: to be complete you must recursively inspect the call graph downward from these symbols (their callees) for any additional functions that contain for-loops, because the MISRA rule requires checking for-loops in called functions as part of loop-body behaviour."
