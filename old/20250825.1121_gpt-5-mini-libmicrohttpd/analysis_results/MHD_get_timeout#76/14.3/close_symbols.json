  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expressions in MHD_get_timeout are invariant you must know the provenance and variability of the values they test and whether the conditional compilation yields the second test. Explanations: \n- MHD_get_timeout64: the call appears directly in the controlling expression (MHD_NO == MHD_get_timeout64(...)). You must inspect its implementation to determine whether it can return different values (i.e. whether the expression is non\u2011invariant) and whether it modifies or depends on daemon state.\n- MHD_DLOG and connection_get_wait: these are callees of MHD_get_timeout64 (per the static call graph). Their behavior/state-dependence can influence the return value of MHD_get_timeout64, so they are needed to judge variability of the first if expression.\n- MHD_NO and MHD_YES: the enumerator values used in the comparison and the function return; knowing their definitions is required to reason about the comparison semantics and whether any constant-folding / macro expansion could make the test invariant.\n- struct MHD_Daemon: the daemon argument is passed into MHD_get_timeout64; knowledge of its fields and semantics is needed to judge whether the call depends on external state (and therefore is non-invariant).\n- uint64_t: the type of t64; needed to reason about the range of values assigned to t64 and comparisons against ULLONG_MAX.\n- MHD_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG: the target type for *timeout and cast; needed to reason about potential truncation/values and whether the second if is meaningful.\n- SIZEOF_UINT64_T and SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG: these preprocessor macros control whether the `if (ULLONG_MAX <= t64)` test is compiled in. You must know their values to know which source form is actually analyzed.\n- ULLONG_MAX: the constant used in the second controlling expression; its numeric value and relation to the range of uint64_t/unsigned long long are required to determine if the comparison ULLONG_MAX <= t64 can be invariant.\n- <stdint.h> and <limits.h>: headers supplying uint64_t and ULLONG_MAX (and related platform size limits); required to determine actual type widths and constant values on the target platform.\n\nWith these symbols you can (a) determine whether the first if depends on runtime state (non\u2011invariant) by inspecting MHD_get_timeout64 and its callees, and (b) determine whether the second if (when compiled in) compares a runtime-varying t64 against a compile-time constant ULLONG_MAX or is effectively constant on the target platform."
