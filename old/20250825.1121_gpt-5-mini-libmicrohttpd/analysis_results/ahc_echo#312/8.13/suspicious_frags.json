  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the character-pointer parameters are already const-qualified (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) and thus comply with the rule. The (void) parameter casts are only used to suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not affect pointer constness. The strcmp usage and the call to MHD_queue_response do not by themselves indicate a violation of Rule 8.13; any pointer-constness issues relevant to those calls would be covered by inspecting the flagged parameter declarations above."
