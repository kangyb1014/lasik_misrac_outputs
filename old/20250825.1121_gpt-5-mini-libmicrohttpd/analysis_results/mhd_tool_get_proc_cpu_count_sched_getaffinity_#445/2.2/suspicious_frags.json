  "explanation": "The only suspicious operation is the initial \"if (0 >= ret)\" wrapper around the Glibc-style attempt: in this function ret is initialized to -1 immediately before that if, so the condition is always true and the conditional test is effectively redundant (an executed operation whose removal would not change program behaviour). Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.2:\n- The manual-counting loop under the #else of HAVE_CPU_COUNT is excluded by the provided define HAVE_CPU_COUNT=1, so it is not compiled/executed (preprocessor-excluded code is not executed and thus not \"dead code\" per the rule note about unreachable code).\n- The HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S block is conditional on the runtime value of ret after the first attempt; it can plausibly be executed (for example if CPU_COUNT yields 0 or sched_getaffinity fails) so its condition is not a compile-time constant and the code is not dead.\n- The final error check and returns (if (0 >= ret) return -1; return ret;) are necessary for correct function behaviour and are not removable without changing outcomes.\n- Conditional branches controlled by macros (e.g. MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS) select alternative valid implementations; presence of these alternatives does not by itself make code dead."
