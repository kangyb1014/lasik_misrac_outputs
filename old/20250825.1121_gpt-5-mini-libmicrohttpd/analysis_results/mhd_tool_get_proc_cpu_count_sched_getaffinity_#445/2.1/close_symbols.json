  "explanation": "To determine whether any portion of mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_ is provably unreachable you must know which preprocessor branches are compiled in and the run-time/ABI semantics of the affinity helpers and CPU macros: \n\n- HAVE_SCHED_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_GETPID: control the entire outer #if. If either is undefined the whole body is excluded and most code becomes unreachable; their defined-ness is decisive for reachability. \n- HAVE_CPU_COUNT: selects the CPU_COUNT path versus the manual loop. Knowing whether this is defined decides which branch inside the first sched_getaffinity success case is reachable. \n- HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S: controls the CPU_ALLOC / CPU_COUNT_S alternative; its defined-ness determines whether that secondary path exists. \n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: changes the argument semantics of CPU_COUNT_S (bytes vs cpu count); needed to know which form is called and whether that call is well-formed/reachable. \n\n- sched_getaffinity: return-value semantics (0 on success, -1 on error) determine whether inner blocks that set ret are executed; used in the conditional that enables counting code. \n- getpid: argument to sched_getaffinity; presence/semantics affect whether sched_getaffinity is a valid call (affects compile-time inclusion) and thus reachability. \n\n- cpu_set_t: type of affinity sets; CPU_COUNT, CPU_ISSET, CPU_COUNT_S and CPU_ALLOC operate on this type \u2014 needed to see which code variants are valid/compiled. \n- CPU_COUNT: yields number of CPUs in a cpu_set_t; whether it exists/its semantics decides whether the branch that uses it can be taken. \n- CPU_COUNT_S: same as above for the sized variant; its signature (bytes vs cpus) is affected by MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS. \n- CPU_ISSET: used in the manual-count loop; its existence/semantics determine whether that loop is meaningful/compiled. \n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: upper bound used in the manual loop; its value is required to reason about loop iterations and reachability of the if (0 == ret) ret = -1; fallback. \n- CPU_SETSIZE: used to compute set_size_cpus for CPU_ALLOC path; needed to know whether the allocation path is sensible/compiles. \n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE, CPU_ALLOC, CPU_FREE: allocation helpers for variable-size cpu_set_t; their presence and semantics determine whether the CPU_ALLOC code path is available and can execute (e.g., whether CPU_ALLOC can return NULL which changes control flow).\n\nTogether these preprocessor symbols, functions, types and macros determine which source lines are compiled and which run-time branches can be taken; they are therefore required to decide if any code in the function is unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code)."
