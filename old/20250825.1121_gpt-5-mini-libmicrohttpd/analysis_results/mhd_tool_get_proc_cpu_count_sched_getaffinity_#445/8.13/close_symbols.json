  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about using const-qualified pointer types where possible, the next analyser needs the exact types and prototypes (or macro definitions) of every symbol that produces or consumes pointers in this function and the feature-test macros that select branches:\n\n- cpu_set_t: the concrete type definition is required to know whether the data it contains is inherently mutable and whether pointers to it may/should be const-qualified.\n- sched_getaffinity: prototype (parameter types and constness) is needed because the function is passed &cur_set and p_set; if sched_getaffinity writes into the buffer it must take a non-const pointer, which prevents adding const.\n- CPU_COUNT: signature (macro or function) is needed to know whether it accepts a const cpu_set_t * (read-only) or cpu_set_t * (modifiable). If it can accept const, passing &cur_set could be const-qualified.\n- CPU_ISSET: signature is needed to determine whether it reads from the set (can accept const) or modifies it (requires non-const).\n- CPU_COUNT_S: prototype is required (and whether its first parameter is a byte size or cpu count) to know the constness of the pointer parameter and whether the code passes the correct type/size; MHD code passes either set_size_bytes or set_size_cpus depending on MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS.\n- CPU_ALLOC: declaration/definition (return type and semantics) is required to know whether the returned cpu_set_t * points to writable memory (non-const) or could be treated as const for read-only usage.\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: definition is needed to know what size type it expects/returns (size_t vs cpus) to match CPU_COUNT_S semantics and pointer use.\n- CPU_FREE: prototype is needed to see whether it requires a non-const pointer (often free-like functions take void *), which affects whether the allocated pointer can be const.\n- CPU_SETSIZE and CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: definitions are needed to understand iteration bounds and the relationship between CPU_SETSIZE (used to compute set_size_cpus) and allocation sizes; they also affect whether CPU_COUNT_S should be called with number-of-cpus or byte-size.\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: this macro switches which argument is passed to CPU_COUNT_S; knowing its definition is necessary to determine the correct CPU_COUNT_S prototype to check constness.\n- HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S, HAVE_SCHED_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_GETPID: these feature-test macros determine which branches of the function are compiled and therefore which pointer usages and symbols actually matter for the MISRA const qualification check.\n\nSupplying these symbols (type definitions and prototypes/macro definitions) lets the analyser determine for each pointer expression (&cur_set, p_set) whether the callee expects/permits a const-qualified pointer or requires a mutable pointer, and thus whether the code violates the MISRA rule."
