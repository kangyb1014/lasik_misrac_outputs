  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of known compiler language extensions in the provided source fragment. The code does not contain GCC/Clang extensions such as inline asm, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__ annotations, labels-as-values, extended vector types, or other vendor-specific keywords. The constructs present are standard C and POSIX usages: static function, block-scope static const, standard control flow, calls to POSIX APIs (sched_getaffinity, getpid), and use of cpu_set_t and CPU_* macros provided by libc. \n\nNotes on potential false positives that do not require investigation here:\n- CPU_COUNT, CPU_COUNT_S, CPU_ALLOC, CPU_ALLOC_SIZE, CPU_FREE, CPU_ISSET, CPU_SETSIZE, cpu_set_t and related macros/types are library/glibc interfaces; their use in source code is not by itself a language extension. If needed, their expansions could be reviewed to ensure they do not expand to compiler-specific extensions, but there is no evidence in the shown code that they do.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)) and the use of feature-test macros (HAVE_*) are standard portable techniques and not language extensions.\n\nIf you want absolute assurance that no language extensions are used by macros or included headers, inspect the definitions/headers of the CPU_* and CPU_ALLOC* symbols and the sched_getaffinity/getpid declarations; only those macro/header definitions could hide compiler-specific extensions. Based solely on the provided function body and symbols, there are no explicit language extensions to report."
