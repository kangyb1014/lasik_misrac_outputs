  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is referenced directly or via conditional compilation in the target function and is needed to decide whether the function violates the MISRA rule about modifying function parameters:\n\n- cpu_set_t: type of cur_set and p_set. Need to know whether this is an lvalue type, a pointer alias, or a struct so we can determine whether uses (and any macros acting on it) could be modifying a function parameter (none here) or introducing hidden pointer semantics.\n\n- sched_getaffinity: prototype and semantics show which arguments are in/out (it writes into the cpu_set_t *). Confirming this ensures we treat writes to the pointed object as allowed and verify no parameter of the target function is being modified.\n\n- getpid: prototype (no parameters). Confirming it has no parameters ensures the call cannot violate the rule by modifying a parameter of this function.\n\n- CPU_COUNT: macro or function used to compute ret from a cpu_set_t. Must inspect its definition to ensure it does not contain side effects that would modify any function parameter if invoked with an expression that could be a parameter in other contexts; also to verify it only reads cur_set (allowed) and does not perform hidden assignments to pointer parameters.\n\n- CPU_ISSET: macro used in the loop. Its definition must be checked for side effects (assignments) or modifications to its argument(s).\n\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: loop bound macro/constant. Needed to verify the loop is over a compile-time constant and to inspect any dependence that could hide parameter modification.\n\n- CPU_SETSIZE: used to compute set_size_cpus. Inspect to know sizing semantics and whether any macro evaluation could have side effects.\n\n- CPU_COUNT_S: variant that counts CPUs in a cpu_set_t *; must inspect its definition (macro vs function) to ensure it does not modify pointer parameters or perform hidden assignments.\n\n- CPU_ALLOC: allocation helper that returns cpu_set_t *; need its implementation/prototype to ensure it does not modify any function parameter (e.g., by writing via pointer arguments) and to understand ownership/side effects.\n\n- CPU_FREE: free helper; inspect to ensure it does not modify any function parameter through pointer arguments.\n\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: macro computing size in bytes for CPU_ALLOC/CPU_COUNT_S. Inspect for side effects.\n\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: conditional macro that changes how CPU_COUNT_S is called (byte count vs cpu count). Needed so the correct form of CPU_COUNT_S can be inspected for side effects.\n\n- HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S, HAVE_SCHED_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_GETPID: compile-time feature macros controlling which code is compiled. To determine which symbols/paths are actually relevant (and thus which macros/functions must be inspected) we must know which of these are defined when the code is built.\n\nIn short, the items above are the local types, macros and functions whose definitions determine whether any operation in the target function produces hidden modifications of function parameters (or would if the same macros were used on parameters). Examining these symbols lets the next agent confirm there are no assignments to this function's parameters (it has none) or hidden parameter-modifying side effects in expanded macros/callees."
