  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings:\n\n- memcmp\n  - The rule targets uses of memcmp. The analyzer must know if memcmp is called directly or indirectly (via macros/wrappers) from this function or any symbols it expands/calls.\n\n- sched_getaffinity, getpid\n  - External library/system functions called here. Their implementations (or wrappers on the platform) could in principle call memcmp or other forbidden patterns; the analyzer must inspect them or confirm they do not use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- CPU_COUNT, CPU_COUNT_S, CPU_ISSET\n  - These are macros or functions operating on cpu_set_t. They are invoked from this function; their definitions must be examined to ensure they do not use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings (or expand to code that does).\n\n- CPU_ALLOC, CPU_ALLOC_SIZE, CPU_FREE\n  - Allocation helpers/macros used when HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S is enabled. Their definitions might be macros or wrappers that could contain/expand to other library calls; include them so the analyzer can check for any memcmp use.\n\n- cpu_set_t\n  - The type used by the CPU_* operations; needed to follow macro definitions and any inline/function implementations that operate on it (and might call memcmp internally).\n\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE, CPU_SETSIZE\n  - Compile-time constants/macros that affect control flow and which CPU_* variants are used. The analyzer needs these to determine which code paths and macros are active and therefore which definitions to inspect.\n\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS\n  - Feature-selection macro that changes how CPU_COUNT_S is called (number-of-cpus vs byte-size). Its presence alters which macro/function variant is instantiated and so which code must be checked for memcmp usage.\n\n- HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S, HAVE_SCHED_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_GETPID\n  - Preprocessor configuration macros present in the function. They determine which blocks of code are compiled in. The analyzer must know their values (or inspect all guarded branches) to know which external symbols/definitions to examine for memcmp usage.\n\nIn short: include memcmp plus every external function/macro/type and the compile-time feature macros referenced by the target function so the next agent can inspect their definitions/implementations and determine whether any of them (directly or indirectly) use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
