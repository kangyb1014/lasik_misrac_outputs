True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe struct member data_iov is declared as a non-const pointer to an I/O vector (MHD_iovec_ *data_iov). Since this member is described as \"I/O vector used with MHD_create_response_from_iovec\" (i.e. supplied/read-only payload descriptors), the pointer should be to a const-qualified type if the implementation only reads from the iovec elements. Declaring it as MHD_iovec_ * permits modification of the pointed-to iovec structures even when unnecessary, which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If the implementation truly needs to modify the iovec elements, then the non-const is acceptable; otherwise change the declaration to const MHD_iovec_ *data_iov;\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64:\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA R8.13 says pointers should point to const-qualified types when they are not used to modify the pointed-to objects. The reporter points out that struct member MHD_iovec_ *data_iov appears to be used as a read-only I/O vector and therefore should be declared as const MHD_iovec_ *data_iov.\n\nThe single function shown (MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64) does not touch data_iov, but that by itself is insufficient to conclude a violation. To demonstrate a true MISRA R8.13 violation you must show that the pointed-to objects are never modified anywhere in the implementation (and that the API semantics intend them to be read-only). No such evidence is provided in the snippet or the surrounding definitions: nothing proves that data_iov elements are not modified by other functions (for example the implementation of MHD_create_response_from_iovec, readers, or response cleanup).\n\nTherefore the report as stated is not correct: there is not enough information to assert a MISRA R8.13 violation. If, after surveying the codebase, you find that the response never modifies the iovec elements (and the API semantics treat them as read-only), then changing the member to const MHD_iovec_ *data_iov would be the correct remediation (subject to API/ABI considerations). If the implementation does modify iovec elements (or the API requires mutable iovecs), the non-const declaration is appropriate and no MISRA violation exists."
