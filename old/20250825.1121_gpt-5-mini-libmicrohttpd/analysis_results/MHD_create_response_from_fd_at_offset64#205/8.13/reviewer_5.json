True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe field is declared as a mutable void *: \"void *crc_cls;\". In the shown code it is used as an opaque closure passed to content-reader callbacks (e.g. response->crc_cls = response;) and is not intended to be modified through that pointer. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be const-qualified when possible (i.e. const void *crc_cls). Therefore this declaration is a violation unless the closure is actually modified via crc_cls elsewhere in the code (no such modification is shown).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64:\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not correct. The crc_cls field is an opaque closure that is stored and later passed to content-reader and free callbacks whose prototypes (in libmicrohttpd) expect void * (non-const). Marking the field as const void * would force casts when passing it to those callbacks (or require changing the public callback signatures), which is not feasible here. MISRA R8.13 encourages const-qualification when possible, but it is reasonable and necessary to keep crc_cls as void * when the surrounding API and callbacks expect a mutable void * parameter. Without evidence that all uses and callback signatures accept const-qualified pointers, the reported violation is not valid."
