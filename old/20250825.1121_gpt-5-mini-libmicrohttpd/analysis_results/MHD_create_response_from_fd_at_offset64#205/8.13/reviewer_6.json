  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the provided code. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is never modified through that pointer. The provided function MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64 does not touch upgrade_handler_cls (and in fact sets crc_cls to point at the response object). The claim that upgrade_handler_cls is only used as an input/closure and never modified is an assertion about all uses of that member across the codebase \u2014 no evidence for that is given here. Without examining every use (reads and writes, casts, or frees) of upgrade_handler_cls (and crc_cls), you cannot conclude a MISRA violation. It may be safe and desirable to change void *upgrade_handler_cls (and possibly void *crc_cls) to const void * if those members are truly only read by the library; but that requires a whole-codebase review. As presented, the report is not proven and therefore not correct."
