  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to determine unreachable code:\n\n- HAVE___LSEEKI64 and HAVE_LSEEK64: The #if block at the top is conditional on these macros. Whether that block is present in the compiled translation unit (and thus whether the comparisons inside it can execute) depends directly on their definition in the build. Determining reachability requires their values.\n\n- off_t (type / sizeof) and _FILE_OFFSET_BITS macro: The #if expression tests sizeof(off_t) relative to sizeof(uint64_t). The compile-time size of off_t (and any feature macro that changes it such as _FILE_OFFSET_BITS) decides whether the whole conditional expression is evaluated and whether its branch can be taken; this affects whether that code is reachable.\n\n- INT32_MAX: The numeric comparisons in the #if block use INT32_MAX. Knowing its value on the target build is necessary to evaluate whether those comparisons can ever be true (constant-fold to false) which would make the return NULL unreachable.\n\n- int64_t / uint64_t (width and signedness) and platform integer-conversion rules (unsigned->signed): The later checks cast uint64_t to int64_t and test < 0. Whether those casts can yield negative values depends on the widths of these types and the implementation-defined semantics for unsigned->signed conversion on the target platform. That affects whether those if-conditions can ever be true (or are impossible), so is required to identify unreachable branches.\n\n- MHD_create_response_from_callback (implementation): The call to this function is followed by a NULL check and an early return. To determine whether the subsequent assignments (response->fd, etc.) are reachable, the implementation (or contract) of this function must be known: can it ever return NULL, can it loop/longjmp, or is it guaranteed to return non-NULL? This matters for reachability of the code after the check.\n\n- MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE: Although not directly a control flow constant, it is an argument to MHD_create_response_from_callback; its value or semantics may influence that function's behavior (allocation success/failure) and therefore reachability of code after the call.\n\n- file_reader (callback) and free_callback (callback): These callbacks are passed into MHD_create_response_from_callback and may influence whether that function succeeds or fails (or installs callbacks that later affect control flow). Their implementations are needed if the response creation success is dependent on them, which affects reachability of the subsequent assignments and return.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition: fd, is_pipe, fd_off, crc_cls): To reason about the statements that assign fields of response and whether those statements are meaningful/compiled, the layout and presence of these members must be known. Also needed to determine whether any of these assignments are optimized away or statically impossible (e.g., if the struct type were opaque in this translation unit), which could make code appear unreachable.\n\nCollecting these symbols (macros, type widths, and the implementations/types used) lets the next analyst evaluate at compile-time and platform/ABI level whether any condition in the function is a constant/always-false or whether later statements are provably unreachable, thereby addressing the MISRA rule about unreachable code."
