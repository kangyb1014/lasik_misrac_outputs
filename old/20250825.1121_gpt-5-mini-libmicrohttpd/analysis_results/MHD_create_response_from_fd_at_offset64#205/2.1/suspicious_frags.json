  "explanation": "Given the additional code defines HAVE_LSEEK64, the entire #if...#endif block is excluded by the preprocessor in the current build and therefore represents code that is not compiled / is effectively unreachable. The rest of the function contains runtime checks and assignments that can be reached at execution time: the signed casts and < 0 checks on size/offset can be true for certain uint64_t values (e.g. values >= 2^63), the call to MHD_create_response_from_callback may return NULL or non-NULL at runtime, and the subsequent assignments to the response structure are normal reachable behaviour. Therefore no other fragments were marked \u2014 they are not statically unreachable in the provided configuration and need no investigation for Rule 2.1 as unreachable code. If other build configurations (different macro definitions) are used, the reported #if block may become reachable and should be re-evaluated accordingly."
