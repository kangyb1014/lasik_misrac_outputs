  "explanation": "I did not mark any other fragments because the remaining code uses standard C features: fixed-width integer types (uint64_t, int64_t), standard casts and comparisons, NULL, standard macros like INT32_MAX, standard boolean literal (false), ordinary function calls and assignments, and struct pointer operations. There are no obvious GCC/MSVC __attribute__ or __declspec uses, inline assembler, nonstandard keywords, or other compiler-specific syntax elsewhere in the snippet. The three reported fragments warrant investigation because they reference macros/identifiers that commonly expand to or indicate platform/compiler-specific extensions (symbol-visibility/linkage macros and platform-specific 64-bit file-offset support and POSIX-type usage)."
