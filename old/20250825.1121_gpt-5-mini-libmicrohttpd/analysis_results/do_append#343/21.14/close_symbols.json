  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The analyzer must explicitly check whether memcmp is referenced directly or indirectly (for example via macros or aliases) in the translation unit that contains do_append.\n\n- memcpy: do_append calls memcpy. The analyzer must confirm that memcpy is not a macro or wrapper that could call memcmp (to exclude indirect memcmp usage) and to distinguish copy operations from comparisons.\n\n- strlen: do_append calls strlen to compute the old length. The analyzer should verify that strlen is the standard string-length function (not a macro or wrapper that internally performs comparisons via memcmp) and to confirm that do_append treats strings via length, not via memcmp comparisons.\n\n- malloc: do_append calls malloc. Including its symbol allows the analyzer to confirm that memory allocation is normal and not substituted by a function/macro that might perform comparisons (unlikely but necessary to rule out indirect memcmp use).\n\n- free: do_append calls free. Similar rationale as malloc: ensure no indirect comparison via wrapper.\n\n- NULL: do_append tests pointers against NULL. The analyzer needs the NULL definition to ensure those checks are ordinary pointer checks and not macros that expand to calls using memcmp.\n\n- size_t: used for the size parameter and lengths; type information is needed to reason about buffer sizes and null-termination handling (whether the code could be comparing strings implicitly).\n\n- MHD_Result: do_append returns MHD_Result values. The analyzer needs this enum/typedef and the concrete MHD_YES/MHD_NO symbols to understand control-flow and return semantics (to ensure no hidden comparisons occur in return macros).\n\n- MHD_YES / MHD_NO: the actual returned constants; including them ensures the analyzer can resolve return values and detect any macro-expansion surprises.\n\n- process_upload_data: listed as the caller in the static call graph. Including the caller allows the analyzer to inspect the calling context for any use of memcmp that might be attributed to the higher-level operation or reveal macros/inline wrappers shared between caller and callee that could introduce memcmp usage.\n\nNote: The main goal is to detect any direct or indirect use of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings. The critical symbols are memcmp, memcpy, strlen and any macros/wrappers (malloc/free/return macros) that could hide or call memcmp. The rest are included to provide type, macro and caller context so the analysis is sound."
