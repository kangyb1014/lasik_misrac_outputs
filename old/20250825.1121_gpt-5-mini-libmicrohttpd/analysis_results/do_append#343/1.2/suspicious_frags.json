  "explanation": "I inspected the function and the related enum for occurrences of compiler-specific language extensions. No such extensions are present: there are no uses of GCC/Clang extensions like __attribute__, __extension__, __asm/asm, statement expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), asm volatile, or other vendor-specific keywords or builtins. Identifiers with leading double underscores or other compiler-specific tokens are not used. The code uses only standard C constructs (enum, static function, pointers, malloc/memcpy/free/strlen, size_t). Note: the provided enum block in the additional code lacks a terminating semicolon (syntax error), but that is a plain syntax issue, not a compiler language extension; it therefore does not trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 and is not reported as an extension."
