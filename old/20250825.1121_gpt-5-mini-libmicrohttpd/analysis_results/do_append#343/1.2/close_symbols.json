  "explanation": "Provide the definitions/prototypes of these symbols so the next analyst can determine whether any of them are implemented using compiler or library language extensions.\n\n- enum MHD_Result: The function's return type. The enum definition must be inspected to ensure it isn't declared using compiler-specific extensions (e.g. custom underlying type annotations, attribute extensions, or non-standard keywords).\n- MHD_YES / MHD_NO: The enumerator or macro constants used as return values. They might be macros or use non-standard constructs; need their definitions to rule out extensions.\n- malloc / free / strlen / memcpy: Standard library functions used by the function. Their declarations (or any local replacements/macros) must be checked for compiler-specific attributes, macros, or redefinitions that constitute language extensions.\n- size_t: The size type used in the signature. Its typedef/source must be checked to ensure it is the standard typedef and not a compiler-specific alias or extension.\n- NULL: The null pointer macro used in conditionals. Different implementations may define NULL using compiler-specific constructs; its definition should be inspected.\n\n(These are the minimal symbols required to decide if the code uses language extensions; standard headers that provide these symbols\u2014if available\u2014also serve this purpose.)"
