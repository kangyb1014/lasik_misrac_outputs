  "explanation": "For verifying MISRA's rule about string functions causing out-of-bounds accesses you must reason about the behavior and preconditions of the standard functions used and the caller-supplied buffers and sizes:\n\n- strlen: Used to compute old_len. You must know that strlen scans until '\\0' and therefore that *ret (when non-NULL) is NUL-terminated and that strlen will not read past the allocated region.\n\n- memcpy: Used twice (copy old_len bytes from *ret, and size bytes from data). You need the exact semantics: it reads/writes the given byte count and thus both source and destination must have at least that many bytes.\n\n- malloc: The allocation result size (old_len + size + 1) must be honored. You need the malloc contract (returns pointer to at least requested bytes or NULL) and to reason about allocation failure handling.\n\n- free: Present for completeness of ownership/heap behavior (not a bounds function itself) and to understand that *ret is deallocated before reuse.\n\n- size_t and SIZE_MAX: Required to analyze the expression old_len + size + 1 for integer overflow/wrap, which could cause an under-sized allocation and subsequent out-of-bounds writes with memcpy or the final '\\0'.\n\n- MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: Return values used by the function (not directly affecting bounds) but needed to understand error paths and whether execution continues after allocation failure.\n\n- process_upload_data (caller): You need the caller signature and its guarantees about the arguments passed to do_append: specifically the invariants that ret (the char** that is passed in) initially points to either NULL or a previously allocated NUL-terminated buffer, and that data (const char*) points to at least size bytes. These preconditions determine whether strlen and the two memcpys are safe.\n\n- Explicit caller-supplied invariants (ret and data): The analysis must rely on the precise guarantees about *ret being NUL-terminated when non-NULL and data being valid for 'size' bytes; if these are not guaranteed by the caller (process_upload_data), do_append may invoke strlen or memcpy out-of-bounds.\n\n- Semantic contracts of strlen/memcpy/malloc (explicit): To prove absence of out-of-bounds accesses you need the standard semantics listed above so you can show each call's source and destination buffers are large enough and that size computations cannot overflow.\n\nThese symbols and contracts are the minimal additional information required to determine if any of the string/memory-handling calls in do_append can access memory beyond the bounds of the referenced objects."
