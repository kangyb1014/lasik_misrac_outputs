  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule 'a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible' we need the following additional symbols and why:\n\n- process_upload_data: Must see how do_append is called (the exact types of the arguments passed). In particular, the type and mutability of the variable whose address is passed as the first parameter (ret) and the origin/type of the second parameter (data) determine whether the pointer-to-pointer could/should use more const (or whether callers require a non-const target). Without the caller(s) we cannot decide if char **ret could be changed to const char * const * or similar.\n\n- enum MHD_Result: The return type and its values (MHD_YES/MHD_NO) are needed to fully understand the function interface; while not directly about pointer constness, the enum definition is part of the API and may affect how callers treat pointers (e.g. error handling/ownership).\n\n- malloc prototype: Confirms malloc returns unqualified storage (void * convertible to char *). To decide if the pointed-to char should be non-const (since the function writes into the allocated buffer), we must know malloc yields modifiable memory.\n\n- free prototype: Shows ownership model (free takes void *). Knowing that do_append frees *ret and assigns a newly malloc'd buffer is necessary to judge whether the pointer target is intended to be mutable.\n\n- strlen prototype: Declared as taking const char *. This clarifies that passing *ret (a char *) to strlen is allowed, but it does not force *ret to be const; it helps assess whether const qualification could be increased.\n\n- memcpy prototype: The source parameter is const void *. This confirms the use of const for 'data' is appropriate and that the function does not attempt to modify 'data'. It helps determine that 'data' is correctly const-qualified and whether any further const promotion is possible.\n\n- size_t typedef and NULL macro: Basic type and macro definitions used in the function. size_t is needed to reason about prototypes and parameter types; NULL presence is relevant to pointer checks. These standard definitions are required to interpret prototypes and calls correctly.\n\nTogether these symbols allow analysis of ownership (malloc/free), mutability of the allocated buffer, and the exact types used by callers so you can determine whether any pointer parameter (particularly the char **ret and the pointed-to char *) could be more const-qualified without breaking callers or semantics."
