  "explanation": "- strlen: used to read *ret (old_len). Need to confirm it only reads the pointee and does not modify the pointer parameter.\n- malloc: used to allocate buf. Confirming its semantics (returns pointer or NULL, does not modify function parameters) is required to reason about whether the function actually writes to the parameter variable ret.\n- free: called with *ret. Freeing the object pointed-to is allowed by the rule, but we must confirm free does not modify the pointer parameter itself (it does not) and understand the effect on the pointee.\n- memcpy: used to copy bytes into the newly allocated buffer. Must confirm memcpy does not modify the pointer parameter ret and only writes to the target buffer.\n- NULL: macro compared against *ret and malloc result; needed to interpret the conditional branches that determine whether the pointee is modified or the pointer itself is reassigned.\n- MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: the return type and constants used by the function. Needed only to fully understand return semantics (no side effects that would alter parameters).\n- process_upload_data: the caller. To fully decide whether modifying *ret violates the broader intent of the MISRA rule it is useful to see how do_append is called (e.g. whether the caller passes the address of a local/parameter/member), so we can determine whether the assignment \"*ret = buf;\" changes a caller's parameter vs. a local object.\n- size_t: type of size and old_len; included to ensure correct interpretation of expressions and buffer-size computations.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether do_append modifies its formal parameter variable (ret) itself versus modifying the object pointed to by ret (which is permitted)."
