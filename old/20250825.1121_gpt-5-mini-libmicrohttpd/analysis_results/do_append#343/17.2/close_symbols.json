  "explanation": "To determine whether do_append is involved in direct or indirect recursion you must examine its caller(s) and their call chains. The only non-target symbol referenced in the static call graph is process_upload_data, so its definition (and the functions it calls and the functions that call it) is required to: (1) confirm whether process_upload_data calls do_append (forming an immediate two\u2011function cycle) or (2) reveal any further call chain from process_upload_data that might eventually call do_append (indirect recursion). No other symbols (e.g. MHD_Result, MHD_YES/MHD_NO or standard library functions) are needed to decide the presence of recursion for this MISRA rule."
