  "explanation": "I reported all occurrences where a non-const pointer type is declared, returned, or assigned from another pointer source and therefore could plausibly be const-qualified (function return/parameter pointer, local pointer declarations/assignments, assignments into structure pointer fields, and the struct fields themselves). Other code fragments were not flagged because they are either already const-qualified (for example the 'params' variable is declared const), are control-flow or error-handling constructs (NULL checks, returns, mhd_assert, free/malloc calls, logging macros) that do not affect pointer constness, or refer to buffers that the function intentionally modifies (so those pointers must be non-const by design). The listed fragments are the sites where const qualification of pointer targets should be examined more closely given the available code."
