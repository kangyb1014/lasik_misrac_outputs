  "explanation": "Only compiler language extensions explicitly documented as such should be reported for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. The code above uses the GCC-style __attribute__((visibility(\"default\"))) construct (via the _MHD_EXTERN macro), which is a compiler extension and therefore warrants investigation. Other constructs in the provided code are standard C or standard library/POSIX APIs and are not compiler language extensions: use of size_t/uint64_t/UINT64_MAX, function-pointer typedefs, const void* to char* assignment, calloc, pthread_mutex_init (wrapped in a macro), preprocessor conditionals (#if/#ifdef), and use of bool (C99 stdbool) are all standard language features or standard library/OS APIs rather than compiler-specific language extensions. These standard constructs do not need to be investigated under Rule 1.2."
