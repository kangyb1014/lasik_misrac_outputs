  "explanation": "The fragments not listed as suspicious are simple assignments, initialisations and the final return: these do not introduce controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. Preprocessor-only lines (other than those that affect which C if-statements are compiled) do not themselves form C controlling expressions. The suspicious items above include all conditional statements and the related macro/definitions that can affect whether those controlling expressions are invariant at compile time or become invariant after macro expansion \u2014 these should be inspected to determine if any controlling expression is effectively constant (always true or always false) in the compiled configuration.
