  "explanation": "No calls to the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this function. The code only assigns the provided buffer pointer to r->data and stores size in r->data_size; it does not dereference or index the buffer or perform any string/memory copy or comparison operations that could read or write beyond the buffer bounds. The function also checks for the obvious invalid case ((buffer == NULL) && (size > 0)) and for MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN when applicable, and allocates/initializes the response structure before use. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need to be investigated for Rule 21.17 violations."
