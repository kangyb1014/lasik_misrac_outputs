  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not proven correct. First, the assignment complained about (r->data_buffer_size = size;) appears in MHD_create_response_from_buffer_copy, not in MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (the agent mis\u2011attributed the location). MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is a whole\u2011project rule: an executed operation is only \u201cdead code\u201d if its removal would not affect program behaviour anywhere in the project. In the snippets you provided the field is written in one place and I see no reads, and the source comment even calls the assignment vestigial \u2014 which makes the claim plausible. However, you have not shown the entire project: the struct field could be read by other compilation units or by external users of the library (the struct appears to be part of the public API), or used under different conditional compilation, so removing the assignment might change behaviour. Therefore the evidence is insufficient to declare a definitive MISRA 2.2 violation. To conclude a true violation, perform a project\u2011wide search for reads of data_buffer_size (and for uses under different build configurations); if there are none, then the assignment (and perhaps the field) is dead and should be removed."
