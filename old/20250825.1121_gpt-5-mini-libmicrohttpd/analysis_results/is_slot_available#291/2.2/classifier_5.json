  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_slot_available:\n```c\nstatic bool\nis_slot_available (const struct MHD_NonceNc *const nn,\n                   const uint64_t now,\n                   const char *const new_nonce,\n                   size_t new_nonce_len)\n{\n  uint64_t timestamp;\n  bool timestamp_valid;\n  mhd_assert (new_nonce_len <= NONCE_STD_LEN (MAX_DIGEST));\n  mhd_assert (NONCE_STD_LEN (MAX_DIGEST) <= MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH);\n  if (0 == nn->nonce[0])\n    return true; /* The slot is empty */\n\n  if (0 == memcmp (nn->nonce, new_nonce, new_nonce_len))\n  {\n    /* The slot has the same nonce already.

  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The mhd_assert(timestamp_valid) is redundant: the code calls get_nonce_timestamp, then asserts timestamp_valid, and immediately afterward checks if (!timestamp_valid) return true; therefore the runtime behavior for the non-failure path is identical with or without the assert. If mhd_assert is implemented as a debug-only/no-op macro (common for assert-like macros) its presence has no effect in release builds. Thus the operation is either compiled out (no effect) or, when active, duplicates a check already handled by subsequent code \u2014 in both cases removal would not affect the normal program behaviour. This constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2."
