True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe mhd_assert invocation can be dead code in typical builds. For example, if mhd_assert is implemented as a diagnostic assertion that evaluates the condition and either does nothing when true or aborts when false (e.g. macro expands to a conditional check that only reports/aborts on failure), then in normal operation the check is executed but has no effect (the condition is always true). In that case removing the assertion check would not change program behaviour for the normal inputs, so the executed assertion constitutes dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Another common scenario is a release build where mhd_assert is defined as a no-op or expands to an expression evaluation with no side effects; the assertion evaluation (when compiled in) would be an operation whose removal does not affect behaviour, hence a violation.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function is_slot_available:\n#define MAX_DIGEST SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE\n...\n#define MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH ((32+6)*2)\n...\n#define REUSE_TIMEOUT 30\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA 2.2 forbids code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The mhd_assert invocations in this function do not meet that definition in general: either they are compiled out (so they are not executed at all), or they have an observable effect (they can abort/report on a failed condition) and therefore their removal could change program behaviour. Even if an assertion's condition happens to be true in many runs, the assertion still may affect timing (note 1 to the rule) or may detect an error in other runs \u2014 so you cannot conclude it is dead code across the project. The agent's scenario (that the assertion is executed but has no effect and can therefore be removed) is not sufficient to demonstrate a MISRA 2.2 violation for this code."
