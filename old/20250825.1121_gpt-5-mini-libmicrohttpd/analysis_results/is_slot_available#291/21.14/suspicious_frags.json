  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 concerns using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The only use of memcmp in this function is the shown fragment, so it must be investigated to determine whether the operands are null-terminated strings and whether the length passed is appropriate. Other parts of the function do not use memcmp or perform string comparisons: checks like '0 == nn->nonce[0]', '0 != nn->nc', '0 == nn->nonce[sizeof(nn->nonce) - 1]' and the timestamp handling (get_nonce_timestamp, TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP) operate on bytes/integers or call other functions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.14. The mhd_assert calls are diagnostics and not uses of memcmp or string comparison either. No other memcmp/string-compare occurrences exist in the provided code fragment."
