  "explanation": "I flagged every conditional return and the surrounding validation that could represent unreachable code paths; these are the control-flow points most likely to be dead/unreachable depending on invariants elsewhere (nonce formatting, supported digest sizes, timestamp encoding, and new_nonce_len). I did not include: - Declarations, assignments and the final \"return false;\" (the final return is reachable under normal valid/non-expired-nonce conditions). - The mhd_assert macro definitions themselves: they are no-ops here and do not introduce control flow; their presence only documents intended invariants but does not, by itself, make adjacent code unreachable. - The struct and macro definitions (e.g. NONCE_STD_LEN, MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH, TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP, REUSE_TIMEOUT): these are data and compile-time constants used by the function; they are not conditional branches to inspect for reachability beyond the conditionals already listed. - The get_nonce_timestamp() implementation beyond noting its return value is used above; I included the timestamp_valid check and its guarded return because that is the immediate control-flow that could be unreachable if timestamps/lengths are guaranteed elsewhere. These listed fragments cover all places in is_slot_available where unreachable code could occur due to invariant assumptions (nonce format/length, supported digest sizes, timestamp decoding, or new_nonce_len). Please inspect each of them with project-wide invariants (how nonces are produced/stored, which SUPPORT macros are defined, and any external guarantees about new_nonce_len) to determine whether any branch is indeed unreachable and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
