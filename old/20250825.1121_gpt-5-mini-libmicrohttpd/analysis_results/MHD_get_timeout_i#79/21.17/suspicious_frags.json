  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appears in the provided code fragments. The functions shown perform integer/uint64_t operations, comparisons, casts, and simple pointer dereference/assignment of a uint64_t* (writing *timeout64). None of these are string-handling library calls and therefore cannot violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. \n\nSpecifically:\n- MHD_get_timeout_i only calls MHD_get_timeout64s and performs integer-range checks and casts; no string functions are used.\n- MHD_get_timeout64s performs numeric comparisons and casts between uint64_t and int64_t and returns values; no string functions are used.\n- MHD_get_timeout64 assigns to *timeout64 and traverses linked connections; this is pointer dereference and assignment, not a string library call.\n- The SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_INT64_T macros are just integer constants used in compile-time branching.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.17 in the supplied code."
