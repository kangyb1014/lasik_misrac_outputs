  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointers and whether they should point to const-qualified types. The only pointer occurrence in this function is the parameter 'daemon' and its uses. Other code fragments do not involve pointers ( SIZEOF_INT/INT_MAX comparisons, integer casts, and the const-qualified local 'to64' ) or are already const-qualified, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and do not need investigation."
