If the callee MHD_get_timeout64s accepts a pointer to const (or if no modification of *daemon occurs), the parameter should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon'. Declaring it non-const when it could be const violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Not enough evidence to show a definite MISRA 8.13 violation. The rule says pointer targets should be const-qualified whenever possible, but whether it is \u201cpossible\u201d here depends on the rest of the API. MHD_get_timeout_i only forwards the daemon pointer to MHD_get_timeout64s; if MHD_get_timeout64s is declared to take a non-const struct MHD_Daemon * (as is common in many C APIs), changing MHD_get_timeout_i to take const struct MHD_Daemon * would be incompatible (you cannot pass a const-qualified pointer to a function expecting a non-const pointer without a cast). If, however, MHD_get_timeout64s already takes const struct MHD_Daemon * (or both functions and all call sites can be changed so the object is never modified), then the parameter here should indeed be const and the agent\u2019s report would be correct. Given only the single function body shown, we cannot conclude a definite MISRA 8.13 violation, so the report as stated is not proven correct."
