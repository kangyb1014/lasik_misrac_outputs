  "explanation": "I selected fragments that can produce behaviourally redundant or conditionally compiled code that may be executed but potentially removable without changing program behaviour. These include: the initial noncelen/strlen assignment (may be unused if callers always supply non-zero noncelen), the compound if with preprocessor guards (preprocessor configuration and constant macros can make parts of the condition redundant or invariant), the timestamp extraction and pointer arithmetic (may be ineffective when lengths/defines produce constants or underflow), the input-null and overflow-return paths inside MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ (these branches affect return values and side-effects and should be checked to ensure they are reachable and necessary), and the final guarded assignment of *out_val (may be a no-op when i==0). I also flagged the feature macros and length macros because their compile-time values directly control which code is compiled in or becomes a constant expression; these macros can make some branches dead or redundant and therefore need inspection. Other fragments in the provided code (function signature, the final 'return true;', the parsing loop body in MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ beyond the overflow check, and the digest-size macro aliases) are standard, directly executed or are compile-time constants that do not by themselves indicate executed-but-removable code, so they are not included for investigation."
