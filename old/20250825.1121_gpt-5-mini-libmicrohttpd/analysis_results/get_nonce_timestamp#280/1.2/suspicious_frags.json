  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code only uses standard C constructs: function with static linkage, pointer and const qualifiers, standard library calls (strlen), preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef/#endif), and standard types/aliases (size_t, uint64_t, bool/true/false) that are part of the C standard (stdbool.h, stdint.h). There are no compiler-specific tokens or extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}) used, nor any GNU/C compiler-only constructs, inline assembly, or nonstandard keywords. The macros MHD_MD5_SUPPORT, MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT, etc., are ordinary preprocessor switches and do not by themselves indicate language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2."
