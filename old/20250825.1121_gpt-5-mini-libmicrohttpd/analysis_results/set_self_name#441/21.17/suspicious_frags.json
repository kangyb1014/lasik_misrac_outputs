  "explanation": "Only the lines that call functions from <string.h> need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because the rule concerns accesses performed by those functions. The other fragments in the function are pointer/NULL checks, comparisons, and control flow (argc/argv checks, NULL tests, pointer comparisons to choose the greater pointer, size computation using sizeof, and returns) and do not directly invoke string.h routines; they serve as guards or control logic and therefore do not themselves trigger Rule 21.17. Note: the declaration and size of self_name (not shown in this fragment) should be inspected by investigators to confirm the correctness of the size comparisons and the safety of the strcpy calls listed above."
