The code only reads argv[0] (compares to NULL and passes it to strrchr/strlen/strcpy), so the pointed-to characters could and should be const-qualified. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A suitable fix is to declare the parameter as const char *const *argv (or at least const char *argv[]), e.g. static void set_self_name(int argc, const char *const *argv).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function set_self_name:\nstatic char self_name[500] = \"perf_replies\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. Rule 8.13 requires that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever that is possible. In the function set_self_name the parameter is declared char *const *argv (pointer to a const pointer to char) so the characters themselves are not const-qualified. The function only reads the contents of argv[0] (passes it to strrchr/strlen/strcpy) and does not modify the characters, so the pointed-to type could and should be const-qualified. Declaring the parameter as const char *const *argv (or const char *argv[]) is the appropriate fix suggested by agent A. Note: changing the prototype may require adjusting call sites because conversions from char ** to const char *const * are not always implicitly allowed, but that is an interoperability concern and does not negate the fact that the original code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
