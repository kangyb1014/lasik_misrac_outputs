  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for unreachable-code Rule 2.1 because they are guarded by runtime conditions or are simple, locally used computations that can be reached depending on inputs:\n\n- The initial search for a directory separator (last_dir_sep = strrchr (argv[0], '/');) and the subsequent check if (NULL != last_dir_sep) depend on the runtime content of argv[0], so neither the branch that computes name_len nor the inner branch that copies the basename into self_name is provably unreachable at compile time.\n\n- The computation of name_len (name_len = strlen (last_dir_sep + 1);) and the bounds check ((sizeof(self_name) / sizeof(char)) > name_len) are runtime-dependent; the copy via strcpy(self_name, last_dir_sep + 1) is reachable only when those runtime conditions hold, and is not statically unreachable.\n\n- The final return; after the default-name strcpy is simply function epilogue and is reachable whenever execution reaches that point.\n\n- No other constant false condition or code after an unconditional return exists in the shown function body (aside from the selected fragments). Therefore those remaining lines are not manifestly unreachable and do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the snippet provided."
