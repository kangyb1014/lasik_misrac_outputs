  "explanation": "The only invariant controlling expression in the function is the literal if (1) inside the _WIN32 conditional; that should be investigated for compliance with Rule 14.3. All other controlling expressions depend on runtime values and therefore are not invariant: - if ((argc >= 1) && (NULL != argv[0])) depends on the runtime arguments. - last_dir_sep = strrchr(argv[0], '/'); the subsequent test if (NULL != last_dir_sep) depends on the runtime result of strrchr. - The Windows-specific combined test ((NULL == last_dir_sep) || ((NULL != last_w32_dir_sep) && (last_w32_dir_sep > last_dir_sep))) uses pointer results from strrchr/runtime pointer comparisons. - name_len = strlen(last_dir_sep + 1); and if ((0 != name_len) && ((sizeof(self_name) / sizeof(char)) > name_len)) is not invariant overall because name_len is computed at runtime (sizeof(self_name)/sizeof(char) is a compile-time constant but the conjunction depends on name_len). - Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef _WIN32) are resolved at compile time and are not covered by Rule 14.3 which concerns controlling expressions in the C source. No do-while or intentional infinite-loop patterns (the permitted exceptions) are present. Therefore only the if (1) needs further investigation."
