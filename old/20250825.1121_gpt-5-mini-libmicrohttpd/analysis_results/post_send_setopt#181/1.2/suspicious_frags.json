  "explanation": "I examined the entire function for use of compiler-specific language extensions. I did not find any constructs that are explicitly compiler extensions in common compiler documentation. Specifically:\n- No use of GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__((...)), __builtin_... intrinsics, __typeof__, typeof, __extension__, __asm__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or vector extensions.\n- No use of Microsoft-specific extensions (e.g. __declspec), no inline assembly, no naked/interrupt function attributes, and no use of non-standard integer types like __int128.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #ifndef / #endif) and macros (including the _() translation macro, MHD_* macros) are standard preprocessor features, not compiler language extensions.\n- The use of bool, const, enum, static functions, pointers and return statements are standard C (C99/C11) features, not compiler-specific extensions.\n- The leading-underscore macro/identifier names (e.g. _MHD_ON) are stylistically reserved by the C standard for implementation, but they are not a compiler language extension; Rule 1.2 requests reporting of explicit language/compiler extensions only.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be reported for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you want, I can also check other files or search for specific extension patterns (e.g. __attribute__, __builtin_, __asm__, typeof) across the codebase."
