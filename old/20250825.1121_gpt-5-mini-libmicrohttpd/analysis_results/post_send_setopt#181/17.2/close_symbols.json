  "explanation": "- MHD_DLOG: Explicit callee in the function (under HAVE_MESSAGES). Needed to check whether logging calls (or functions it calls) transitively call back to post_send_setopt.\n- MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_: Called repeatedly in many #ifdef branches. Must be inspected to ensure it does not call (directly or indirectly) any of the callers of post_send_setopt, creating a recursion cycle.\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: Same reason as above (called in multiple branches) \u2014 verify it cannot lead back to post_send_setopt.\n- zero_send_: Called as an alternate push mechanism in several branches; must be checked for any path that calls back into send stacks that may eventually reach post_send_setopt.\n- mhd_assert: Called in one branch; include to rule out any macro/auxiliary behaviour that could expand to calls that lead back to post_send_setopt.\n- pre_send_setopt: Appears together with post_send_setopt in the send call sequence (and is a callee of the same callers). Inspect to ensure pre_send_setopt (or functions it calls) does not create an indirect recursion with post_send_setopt.\n- MHD_send_data_: One of the static callers of post_send_setopt; include to examine the full caller->callee chain for cycles.\n- MHD_send_hdr_and_body_: Caller of post_send_setopt; include to detect any indirect path from post_send_setopt through its callees back to this caller.\n- MHD_send_sendfile_: Caller of post_send_setopt; include for the same reason \u2014 to detect potential cycles.\n- send_iov_nontls: Caller of post_send_setopt; include to ensure no indirect recursion via iovec/send paths.\n\nRationale summary: to prove absence (or presence) of direct/indirect self-calls you must inspect every function post_send_setopt calls (and any macros it expands to) and every function that calls post_send_setopt (and their callees) to detect cycles; the symbols above cover the direct callees present in the source and the primary callers shown in the static call graph so the next agent can analyze possible recursion cycles."
