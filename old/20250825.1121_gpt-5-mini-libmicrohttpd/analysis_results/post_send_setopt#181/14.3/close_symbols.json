  "explanation": "For deciding whether any controlling expression in post_send_setopt is invariant (MISRA rule), the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- MHD_USE_MSG_MORE: preprocessor conditional that selects code paths; its definition determines whether branches that contain certain if-conditions exist at all (invariant by virtue of being compiled out).\n- MHD_TCP_CORK_NOPUSH: selects the large cork-vs-nodelay code region; affects which controlling expressions are present after preprocessing.\n- _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS: controls inner branching inside the cork-handling path; needed to know which if/else conditions remain.\n- _MHD_NODELAY_SET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS: further refines cork/nodelay strategy in the compiled code; affects presence and form of controlling expressions.\n- _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA: controls an alternate cork-reset branch used on some kernels; affects presence of runtime conditionals.\n- HAVE_MESSAGES: enables the final MHD_DLOG call block; needed to know if that conditional logging block exists.\n\n- _MHD_YES, _MHD_ON, _MHD_OFF: the tristate/boolean constants used in comparisons (e.g., _MHD_YES == connection->is_nonip, _MHD_OFF == connection->sk_corked). Their definitions (values/types) are required to determine if comparisons are compile-time constant or always-false/true due to type/constant folding.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection::is_nonip, ::sk_corked, ::sk_nodelay, ::daemon: the controlling expressions reference these fields. Their types (and whether any of them are manifest constants, macros, or otherwise invariant) are needed to decide if comparisons involving them are invariant.\n- enum MHD_tristate (if declared): sk_corked/sk_nodelay may be of this enum; the enum definition is needed to assess possible values and whether comparisons can be reduced to invariants.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_, MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: these functions appear in controlling expressions (if (MHD_connection_set_...(...))). Their declarations/definitions (return type and whether they are macros/inline/const-foldable) are required to know if those calls are constant/invariant or have side effects that make the controlling expressions non-invariant.\n- zero_send_: used in conditional checks; its signature/definition is required for the same reason as the MHD_connection_set_* functions.\n\n- mhd_assert: may expand to an expression or to nothing depending on build; its definition can affect whether an assertion produces an actual controlling expression (or is removed) and therefore whether any surrounding controlling expression is effectively invariant.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: included because it sits behind HAVE_MESSAGES. While the logging call itself is not needed to judge invariance, its presence/absence (and the macro that enables it) determines whether the final conditional block exists; include it to allow the analyzer to fully reconstruct compiled control-flow.\n\nIn short: all preprocessor feature-test macros that select code paths, the tristate/constants used in comparisons, the connection struct fields/types referenced by the if-statements, and the functions/macros used inside controlling expressions must be known to determine whether any controlling expression in this function is compile-time invariant (or reduced to an invariant by preprocessing/constant-folding)."
