  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function post_send_setopt and the related symbol definitions. None of the Standard Library string-handling functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are used in the supplied code fragments. The code contains socket option calls (setsockopt), enum/state checks, calls to helper functions (MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_, MHD_connection_set_cork_state_, zero_send_, MHD_DLOG), and several constant string literals passed to logging functions. There are no direct buffer-copy or string-manipulation calls that could cause out-of-bounds accesses via the <string.h> APIs in the shown code. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that need to be investigated for Rule 21.17."
