  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: required to know which members (is_nonip, sk_corked, sk_nodelay, daemon, etc.) are read or potentially modified by called routines and whether any member access in post_send_setopt would be illegal if the parameter were const.\n- MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_: post_send_setopt calls this with the connection pointer; to decide if the parameter could be made const we must know this function's prototype and whether it modifies the MHD_Connection state (and whether it accepts a non-const pointer).\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: same rationale as for set_nodelay; it is invoked with the connection pointer and may modify socket state inside the structure.\n- zero_send_: called with connection and used to push data; need its prototype/behavior to determine whether it mutates the connection (and whether it requires a non-const pointer).\n- MHD_DLOG: used for logging with connection->daemon; need its prototype to confirm it does not require a non-const connection (and to check whether taking daemon via a const connection is permitted).\n- mhd_assert: used with connection->sk_corked; include to ensure that any side-effects/macros do not require a mutable connection pointer.\n- enum MHD_tristate / macros (_MHD_YES, _MHD_ON, _MHD_OFF): types/values of sk_corked/sk_nodelay and is_nonip are needed to understand how those members are used (comparisons vs. modifications) and whether making the connection pointer const would be compatible.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the pointer parameter could/should be const under MISRA (i.e., post_send_setopt does not modify the pointed object), we must know the struct layout and the exact prototypes and mutability semantics of each callee that receives the connection pointer or accesses its members."
