  "explanation": "You must inspect any called functions/macros and the data types/macros referenced in post_send_setopt to be sure the function parameters themselves are not being modified (MISRA: parameter variable must not be assigned). Reason for each symbol:\n\n- MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_: called repeatedly; may be a function or a macro/inline that could conceivably assign to the parameter variable (or expand to code that does). Inspect to confirm it only modifies pointed-to objects, not the local parameter variable.\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: same rationale as above \u2014 ensure its implementation does not reassign the parameter identifier.\n- zero_send_: called in several branches; could be a macro or inline that might modify parameters or use/assign identifiers \u2014 verify its definition.\n- mhd_assert: typically a macro; could expand to code with side effects (e.g. referencing/modifying parameters) in some builds \u2014 check its expansion.\n- MHD_DLOG: logging macro/function used at the end; as a macro it could expand to code that modifies parameters \u2014 inspect definition.\n- struct MHD_Connection: the parameter is a pointer to this type; you must see the actual struct definition to know whether any of the field accesses are implemented via macros or side-effecting accessors, and to distinguish allowed modifications of pointed-to objects from forbidden reassignment of the parameter variable.\n- enum MHD_tristate: used for sk_corked/old_cork_state; definition is needed to understand whether those identifiers are macros/values or something that might hide side effects.\n- _MHD_YES, _MHD_OFF, _MHD_ON: these compare against connection fields; they may be macros \u2014 verify they are simple constants (no side effects) and do not hide assignments.\n- MHD_USE_MSG_MORE, MHD_TCP_CORK_NOPUSH, _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS, _MHD_NODELAY_SET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS, _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA, HAVE_MESSAGES: these preprocessor configuration macros change which code paths are compiled in. To prove absence of parameter reassignment under all builds you must check the alternate expansions/branches controlled by these macros (and any code included by them) to ensure none of those variants assign to the function parameters.\n\nIn short: inspect the implementations/definitions of the listed functions/macros and the connection/tristate types and the preprocessor configuration symbols so you can verify that post_send_setopt does not perform any assignment to its parameters (connection, plain_send_next, push_data) either directly or via macro expansions."
