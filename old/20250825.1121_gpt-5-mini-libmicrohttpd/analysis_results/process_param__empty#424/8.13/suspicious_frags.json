  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code for pointer declarations that lack const qualification:\n- The function parameter is declared as const char *param_name, which complies with Rule 8.13.\n- There are no other pointer declarations in process_param__empty (no local pointer variables or non-const pointer parameters).\n- The tool_params initializer shown contains only integer/boolean fields (no pointer members present in the provided definition), so there are no non-const pointer members to inspect.\n- Calls to fprintf pass param_name (a const char *) via varargs; this is an argument use, not a pointer declaration, and the FILE *stderr object is from the standard library (its declaration is external and cannot be changed here). These do not constitute pointer declarations that should be made const under Rule 8.13.\n- The use of param_name[1] is an access through the existing const pointer and does not indicate a missing const qualifier.\nGiven the provided code and related definitions, there are no pointer declarations that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, so no suspicious fragments to report."
