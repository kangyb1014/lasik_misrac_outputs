  "explanation": "- tool_params: The controlling expressions in the if-statements read fields of this global. To decide if those tests are invariant you must see the variable\u2019s declaration/definition (storage class, extern/static), and whether it can change at runtime.\n- type/definition of tool_params (struct/union tag and its member declarations): The member types (e.g. int, bool, bit-field, enum), and any const/volatile qualifiers affect whether an expression like if (tool_params.tiny) is an invariant (compile-time constant or effectively unmodifiable) or allowed to vary at run-time.\n- tool_params.tiny / tool_params.medium / tool_params.large / tool_params.empty (member declarations): The exact declarations (type, const, volatile, bit-field width) determine whether the tested expressions are constant/invariant. For example, a const-qualified member or a compile-time constant initializer could make the condition invariant; a volatile or non-const member can be modified at runtime.\n- definition/initializer of tool_params (where the variable is defined): The initializer value(s) show whether the members are fixed to constant values at program startup; together with the declaration they indicate if members are immutable for the program\u2019s lifetime.\n- process_param__tiny, process_param__medium, process_param__large: These functions (or any other functions that set the same members) are relevant because if they can modify the tiny/medium/large fields before or after process_param__empty is called, the controlling expressions are not invariant. You need their definitions to determine whether those members can be changed at runtime and thus whether the if-expressions can vary.\n\n(Other symbols in the function such as fprintf, stderr, the enum return values, and the parameter param_name do not affect whether the controlling expressions are invariant for the MISRA C rule and therefore are not required for this specific check.)"
