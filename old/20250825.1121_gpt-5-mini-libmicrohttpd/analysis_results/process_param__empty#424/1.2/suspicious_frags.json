  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/clang extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or inline assembly (asm/asm volatile).\n- There are no vendor-specific keywords or pragmas present that would be marked as compiler extensions in compiler documentation.\n- The expression \"tool_params.empty = ! 0;\" uses standard C logical negation of 0 (yielding 1), not an extension.\n- The ternary operator and character literal comparison (\"'-' == param_name[1]\") are standard C constructs.\n- The identifier containing double underscores (process_param__empty) may be reserved by the implementation, but this is not a compiler language extension covered by Rule 1.2; it is a naming-reservation issue rather than use of a language extension.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this code."
