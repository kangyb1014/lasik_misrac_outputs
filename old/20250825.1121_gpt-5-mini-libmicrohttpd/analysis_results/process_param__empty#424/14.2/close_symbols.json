The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether process_param__empty violates the MISRA C \"for loop shall be well-formed\" rule we must be sure that there are no for-loops introduced implicitly by any identifiers used in the function (for example via macros or inline function bodies) and to understand any types/side-effects that could affect loop analysis. For each symbol:\n\n- tool_params (and its type / member definitions: tiny, medium, large, empty): The function tests and assigns members of this global. The full definition is required to check whether any of these members are macros or properties with accessor functions, or whether assignment/reads expand to code that contains a for loop or side effects that could affect a loop counter. Also the member types (boolean/int) are needed to see if they could be loop control flags elsewhere.\n\n- fprintf (declaration/definition or macro expansion): fprintf might be a macro that expands into other code. We must confirm it is the standard library function (no hidden for loops or side effects that would matter for MISRA for-loop behaviour if a for were present).\n\n- stderr (declaration/macro): stderr could be a macro or an object; its expansion could introduce code. Confirming its definition ensures no unexpected control flow/loops are hidden.\n\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: These return values may be macros or expressions. Their definitions must be checked to ensure they do not expand to function calls or blocks that contain for loops or side effects relevant to loop analysis.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result: The function return type must be known to ensure the PERF_RPL_PARAM_* identifiers are simple constants of that enum and not complex macros or inline functions.\n\n- param_name (const char *): Although a local parameter, knowing its type confirms that the indexing expression param_name[1] is a simple array access and not a macro that could hide loops/side effects.\n\nCollectively, these symbols are the only external identifiers referenced in process_param__empty; verifying their definitions confirms there are no hidden or indirect for-loops or unexpected side effects that would cause a MISRA for-loop rule violation. No other callees or local constructs in this function reference for-loops directly, so no additional symbols are required for this specific analysis."
