  "explanation": "The TLS-handling branch is the only portion that is provably unreachable given the provided configuration: HTTPS_SUPPORT is not defined, so tls_conn is defined as the constant 'false' (const bool tls_conn = false;). That makes the entire 'if (tls_conn) { ... }' block unreachable at runtime and therefore worthy of investigation for Rule 2.1.\n\nOther parts of the function do not represent clearly unreachable code and therefore do not need investigation here:\n- The plaintext (non-TLS) branch (the else branch) is reachable because tls_conn is false at compile time. Its logic depends on runtime values (buffer_size, return of MHD_send4_, errno) and so cannot be proven unreachable from the provided information.\n- EPOLL_SUPPORT-controlled code is enabled (EPOLL_SUPPORT is defined) and is reachable depending on runtime conditions (error paths or send size vs returned size), so it should be inspected in normal review but is not provably unreachable.\n- MHD_USE_MSG_MORE is defined, so the MSG_MORE variant of the send call is active; the alternative #else in that conditional is not present in the built configuration (thus not part of the compiled function) and therefore need not be flagged here.\n- Error-handling branches that depend on gnutls or send() return values (ret) or on errno are runtime-dependent and cannot be marked unreachable without further information.\n\nGiven the project configuration snippets supplied, only the TLS branch (and the lines that exist solely under the assumption of HTTPS_SUPPORT) are statically unreachable and should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C Rule 2.1."
