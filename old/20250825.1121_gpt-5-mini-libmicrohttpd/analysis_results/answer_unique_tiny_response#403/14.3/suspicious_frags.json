  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant at runtime. The function contains two if statements: the first (if (NULL == *req_cls)) depends on the value pointed to by req_cls at each call and is not a compile-time constant; the second (the strcmp-based conjunction testing method against two HTTP-method strings) depends on the runtime method argument and is not invariant. There are no loop (for/while/do) or switch controlling expressions in the function that could be constant, and the code does not create an intentional infinite loop. The preprocessor conditional (#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701) is a compile-time conditional, not a C-language runtime controlling expression covered by MISRA C Rule 14.3, so it does not constitute a violation of the rule. Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
