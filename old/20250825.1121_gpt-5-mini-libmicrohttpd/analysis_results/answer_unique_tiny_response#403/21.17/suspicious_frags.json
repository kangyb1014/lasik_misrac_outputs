  "explanation": "Only the above if-statement contains calls to functions from <string.h> (strcmp) and therefore is the primary place to verify that pointer parameters reference valid, nul-terminated buffers and are not NULL. Other parts of the function do not invoke <string.h> functions:\n- The MHD_create_response_from_buffer[_static] calls and the MHD_* response API use provided buffer/length arguments; they are not string.h calls and so are out of scope for Rule 21.17 here.\n- The (void) casts for cls, url, version, upload_data, and upload_data_size are just to suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not use string.h functions.\n- The req_cls handling, marker usage, and MHD_queue_response / MHD_destroy_response calls do not call any string.h functions.\nAccordingly, only the strcmp usages require investigation for possible out-of-bounds or NULL-pointer issues per MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
