That produces a void * that points to a non-const type even though the data is immutable. This discarding of const violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible). The correct fix is to preserve const (e.g. use an API accepting const void * or use the static response helper that takes a const buffer) rather than casting away const.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function answer_unique_tiny_response:\n#define MHD_HTTP_OK 200\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the described scenario. The cast (void *) tiny_body in the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer discards the const-qualification of tiny_body (assuming tiny_body is a const char[] or const char * as is typical for string literals). MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible; explicitly converting a pointer-to-const to a plain void * (removing const) violates that guideline. Note: if tiny_body were actually a non-const array of char, no const would be discarded and there would be no violation; however, for a static/immutable string the cast is a violation. The code already shows a const-correct branch (MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static) for newer library versions; the correct remedies for the older-API case are to use an API that accepts const void * (or a const-correct helper), or to avoid making tiny_body const if it truly must be modifiable (which is unlikely for a static string)."
