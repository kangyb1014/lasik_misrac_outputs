  "explanation": "The fragments above are flagged because they contain or invoke compiler-specific extensions: the _MHD_EXTERN macro uses the GCC/Clang __attribute__((visibility(...))) extension, and the MHD_PANIC macro contains BUILTIN_NOT_REACHED (likely a compiler builtin such as __builtin_unreachable), which are language/compiler extensions covered by Rule 1.2. Other parts of the function (enum type and value comparisons, if/else, assignments, function call and return, pointer parameters, the _(...) message macro) use standard C constructs and do not by themselves indicate use of compiler language extensions, so they need not be investigated for Rule 1.2. Note: identifier naming (leading underscores) is a separate concern but is not a language-extension violation under Rule 1.2."
