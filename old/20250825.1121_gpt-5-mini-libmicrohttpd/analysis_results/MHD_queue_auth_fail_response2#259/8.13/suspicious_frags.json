  "explanation": "I selected the non-const pointer parameters and their use in the call to MHD_queue_auth_required_response3 because Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. The other code fragments do not need investigation for this rule: 'const char *realm' and 'const char *opaque' are already const-qualified; the local enum and non-pointer variables are not relevant; the string literal in MHD_PANIC is a const char literal; the NULL literal itself does not indicate missing const qualification. No other pointer declarations appear in this function. Investigators should check whether 'connection' and 'response' are modified (directly or via the callee) to decide if they can be const-qualified."
