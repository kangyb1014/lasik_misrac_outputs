  "explanation": "Reasoning why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\":\n\n- tool_params (definition/declaration, especially the type and qualifiers of .connections)\n  - You must know the exact type, constness, and declaration scope of tool_params.connections to determine whether the expression (0 == tool_params.connections) or comparisons against it can ever change at runtime or are compile-time/invariant. If .connections is a compile-time constant or declared const, the controlling expression could be invariant.\n\n- all assignments/initialisation sites for tool_params.connections (command-line parsing / parameter-apply routines)\n  - To decide if tool_params.connections is invariant you need to find every place it is initialized or modified. If it is only assigned once at program startup or never modified, the condition may be effectively invariant for the relevant scope; if it can be changed at runtime (e.g. by command-line parsing, config reload, or API calls), the condition is not invariant.\n\n- get_num_threads (definition and return semantics)\n  - The second controlling expression calls get_num_threads(). You must inspect its implementation and documented semantics to know whether its return value is constant (e.g. fixed at compile/link time), varies during runtime (e.g. depends on environment, CPU count, runtime options), or can change while the program runs. That determines whether the comparison (get_num_threads() > tool_params.connections) is invariant.\n\n- get_cpu_core_count (definition)\n  - get_num_threads() calls get_cpu_core_count; if get_num_threads delegates to it, you need its behavior to know whether get_num_threads() can vary (for example, if it queries the OS each time vs returns a cached/constant value).\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count (definition)\n  - Same as above: get_num_threads() may call this function to determine thread limits; its semantics determine whether get_num_threads() is invariant.\n\n- check_apply_params (parameter-application entry; to locate where connections may be set)\n  - This function is the orchestrator for applying program parameters (appears in the call graph). Inspecting it and its parameter-apply helpers can reveal where tool_params.connections is read/changed (e.g. from CLI or config). Knowing whether connections can be set at runtime or only once influences whether the controlling expressions are invariant.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the two if-expressions in check_param__connections are invariant you must examine the definition and mutability of tool_params.connections and the runtime behavior of get_num_threads (and the lower-level functions it uses). Also inspect the code paths that initialize or change tool_params.connections (parameter-apply and parsing routines such as check_apply_params and any specific assigners)."
