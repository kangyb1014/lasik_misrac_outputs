  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown fragment: the controlling expression depends on runtime values (get_num_threads() and tool_params.connections) and is not inherently invariant. A violation would occur if both operands were constant/invariant so the comparison always had the same truth value\u2014for example, if get_num_threads() were a macro or function that always returns 1 and tool_params.connections were a compile-time constant 0, making (get_num_threads() > tool_params.connections) always true (an invariant controlling expression)."
