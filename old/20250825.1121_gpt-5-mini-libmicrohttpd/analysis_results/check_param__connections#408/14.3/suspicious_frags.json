  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The two if statements above contain the only controlling expressions in this function and thus should be investigated to ensure they are not invariant (e.g. if tool_params.connections were a compile-time constant or get_num_threads() returned a constant). Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: the return statements (including 'return ! 0;') are not controlling expressions, the fprintf call is not a controlling construct, and there are no loops or do-while constructs in this function that could contain invariant controlling expressions."
