This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- get_num_threads: called directly by check_param__connections; its implementation may call string.h functions (e.g., parsing, copying) that could violate the MISRA <string.h> bound rule. You must inspect it.  \n- get_cpu_core_count and get_process_cpu_core_count: these are callees of get_num_threads in the provided call graph. Any use of <string.h> functions in those implementations would be reachable from the target and must be checked.  \n- tool_params: contains the connections member accessed in the target; its type and definition must be known to ensure there is no hidden string operation or incorrect formatting/interpretation that could lead to buffer access issues.  \n- fprintf and stderr: while not functions from <string.h>, fprintf is used with format strings and arguments in the target; you should check the usage for any interactions that could rely on or trigger string operations (and to ensure no mismatched types leading to undefined behaviour).  \n\nFocus analysis first on get_num_threads and its callees for any direct calls to memcpy/memmove/memset/strlen/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strcmp/etc. The other symbols are included to confirm there are no indirect string operations or format-related issues that could interact with string handling."
