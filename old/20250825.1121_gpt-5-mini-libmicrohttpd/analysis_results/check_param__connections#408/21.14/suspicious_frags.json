  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The code fragments shown perform numeric comparisons and I/O only: check_param__connections compares unsigned integers and calls fprintf/printf; get_num_threads, get_cpu_core_count, and get_process_cpu_core_count manipulate and return unsigned integers and call printf; disabled (#if 0) sections contain no memcmp usage. There are no string comparisons or uses of memcmp on null-terminated strings in the supplied code, so no fragments require investigation for Rule 21.14."
