  "explanation": "- get_num_threads: direct callee of the target function; it and its implementation must be inspected because memcmp could be used inside it to compare strings \u2014 if so, the target function would indirectly rely on code that violates the MISRA rule.\\n- get_cpu_core_count: callee of get_num_threads; include its definition because memcmp usage may be deeper in the call chain.\\n- get_process_cpu_core_count: callee of get_num_threads; include its definition for the same reason as above.\\n- tool_params (definition and type, especially connections): the target function inspects tool_params.connections. You need the structure/type declaration to confirm that connections is an integer (as implied by %u) and not a char* or string-like type; if it were a string, code elsewhere might perform memcmp-based string comparisons related to connections.\\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any memcmp-based null-terminated string comparisons occur in the code paths invoked by the target function."
