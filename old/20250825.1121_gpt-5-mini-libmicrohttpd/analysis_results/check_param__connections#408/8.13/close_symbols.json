  "explanation": "- tool_params: determine the exact declaration and type of the global variable used (tool_params.connections). MISRA check needs to know whether 'connections' is an integral or pointer type; if it's a pointer field the const-qualification of that pointer must be examined.\\n- struct tool_params (definition): the full struct/type definition is required to see the types of any fields (e.g. whether connections is a pointer or contains pointer members that might need const).\\n- get_num_threads (declaration/definition): the function return type must be known to see whether the call returns a pointer type that should be const-qualified. Also its prototype may reveal pointer parameters/returns relevant to the rule.\\n- fprintf (declaration): to confirm the parameter types used (notably the format parameter is const char *) and ensure the call site does not violate pointer const-qualification requirements.\\n- stderr (symbol): its type (FILE *) must be known to verify whether passing it to fprintf is appropriate and whether FILE * should be const-qualified in this context.\\n- FILE (type): the definition/typedef of FILE is needed to judge whether FILE * usage here could/should be const-qualified under MISRA (and to confirm that fprintf expects a non-const FILE *).\\nThese symbols provide the type information necessary to decide if any pointer in check_param__connections should be const-qualified (or if existing library prototypes already use const where appropriate)."
