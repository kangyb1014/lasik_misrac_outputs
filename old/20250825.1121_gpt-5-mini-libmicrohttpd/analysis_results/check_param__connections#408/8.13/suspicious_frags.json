  "explanation": "No pointer objects or pointer declarations appear in the provided code (neither in check_param__connections nor in the static tool_params initializer). The function uses only integer comparisons and calls (get_num_threads()) and passes a string literal to fprintf; fprintf's format parameter is a const char * in the standard API, and the string literal is used directly (no pointer variable or pointer cast is present). tool_params.connections is an integer member, not a pointer. There are no pointer returns, pointer parameters, pointer assignments, or pointer casts in the shown fragments that could be checked against MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, so no suspicious fragments relating to that rule are present."
