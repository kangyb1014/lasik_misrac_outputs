The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "tool_params / tool_params.connections: need the type and qualifiers (signed/unsigned width, volatile/const) of the connections field to know whether comparisons with get_num_threads are well-typed and whether connections could be modified as a side effect by other code (MISRA forbids using objects modified in the loop body in the loop test).\nget_num_threads: the full prototype/definition is required to determine its return type and whether it has persistent side effects or modifies global objects (MISRA treats the behaviour of called functions as part of loop behaviour; if get_num_threads has side effects that touch loop counters or other objects, that matters).\nget_cpu_core_count and get_process_cpu_core_count: get_num_threads calls these; their definitions are needed to complete the side-effect analysis of get_num_threads (to see whether any of those callees modify global state or objects that could be used as loop counters).\nfprintf and stderr: the function calls fprintf(stderr, ...) inside this function; to assess whether this call has side effects relevant to the MISRA for-loop rule (e.g. if this function were used within a for-clause, I/O would be a persistent side effect) the standard I/O functions/objects should be considered."
