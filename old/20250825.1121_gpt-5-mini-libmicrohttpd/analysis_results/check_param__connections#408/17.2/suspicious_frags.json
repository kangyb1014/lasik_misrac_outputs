  "explanation": "No functions in the provided code call themselves directly or form an indirect recursion cycle. check_param__connections only calls get_num_threads(); get_num_threads() in turn calls get_cpu_core_count(), get_process_cpu_core_count(), and the detect_* helpers. None of these shown functions call back to check_param__connections or to get_num_threads(), and the disabled #if 0 blocks do not introduce calls. The static cached variables (num_threads, num_cpu_cores, proc_num_cpu_cores) are only used for caching initialization and do not imply recursion. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 17.2."
