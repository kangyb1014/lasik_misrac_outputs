  "explanation": "I found no executed code fragments in the provided snippets that qualify as dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Reasons: \n\n- The static initialization of tool_params is an initializer; per the rule notes initialization is not treated as an assignment and is not a candidate for dead code. \n- The code inside #if 0 ... #endif is not compiled/executed, so it is not dead code (dead code is executed but redundant). \n- All conditional tests (e.g. in check_param__connections, get_num_threads) affect control flow and return values; removing them would change program behaviour. The fprintf/printf calls have observable side effects (output), so they are not removable without changing behaviour. \n- The static caching in get_cpu_core_count/get_process_cpu_core_count/get_num_threads is used to avoid repeated detection and affects returned values; these assignments are not redundant. \n- The return-value checks in main and check_apply_params (including the negative/zero checks) determine program flow and are not redundant. \n\nGiven the provided code, no executed operations appear to be removable without affecting program behaviour, so there are no suspicious dead-code fragments to report."
