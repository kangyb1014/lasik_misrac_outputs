  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically checked items and reasons they do not require investigation:\n\n- No use of GCC/Clang/MSC extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, __asm, asm volatile, or __declspec.\n- No use of statement expressions ({ ... }) as an expression or nested functions (a known GCC extension).\n- No use of labels-as-values (&label) or other nonstandard label features.\n- No use of inline assembly, vendor-specific pragmas, or nonstandard calling-convention keywords.\n- No use of zero-length arrays, unnamed/anonymous structs/unions as an extension, or other nonstandard struct/union features.\n- No use of variable-length array extensions beyond standard C99 (no VLA usage detected anyway), no designated compiler-specific initializers.\n- Preprocessor usage (#if 0) is standard and only disables code; nothing like #pragma with vendor-specific semantics appears.\n- All operators and constructs seen (e.g., ! 0, comparisons, standard function definitions, static storage) are standard C and not compiler extensions.\n\nGiven the absence of any tokens or constructs that are documented as compiler extensions, there are no fragments that need to be flagged for Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used). If there are additional source files or compiler-specific headers not provided here, please supply them for review in case they introduce nonstandard extensions."
