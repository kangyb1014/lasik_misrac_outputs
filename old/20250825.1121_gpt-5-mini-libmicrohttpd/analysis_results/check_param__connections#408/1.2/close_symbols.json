  "explanation": "- tool_params: The full declaration/definition of the tool_params object (its type and any storage-class or attribute annotations) is required to check whether its declaration uses any compiler-specific language extensions (for example __attribute__, non-standard storage qualifiers, or non-standard struct features).\n\n- tool_params.connections: The type of the connections member (signed/unsigned integer width) is needed to verify that the use in the format string \"%u\" is appropriate and that no non-standard member declarations (bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, compiler-specific extensions) are used.\n\n- get_num_threads: The prototype/definition and return type are required to (a) determine the type returned (to validate the \"%u\" format specifier and type compatibility) and (b) inspect whether the function declaration/definition uses any language extensions (inline variants, GCC attributes, nested-function syntax, typeof, or other compiler-specific constructs).\n\n- fprintf: The declaration (from <stdio.h>) is needed to confirm standard signature and ensure no project-local redefinition or macro replacing fprintf with a non-standard/extension implementation is present.\n\n- stderr: The declaration/definition of stderr is required to confirm it is the standard FILE* object and not a project-specific or extension symbol (or macro) introduced by compiler-specific headers.\n\n- FILE: The definition/type of FILE (from <stdio.h> or any translation-unit-local override) is needed to ensure standard type usage and to detect any non-standard redefinitions or compiler-specific extensions affecting standard I/O types.\n\nOverall these symbols let the analyst verify both (1) that the expressions and format-specifier usage in the function are type-correct (no reliance on non-standard integer widths or mismatched types) and (2) that none of the referenced declarations/definitions introduce compiler-specific language extensions (attributes, nonstandard declarations, macros replacing standard names, nested functions, typeof, etc.)."
