  "explanation": "The rest of the provided code fragments do not contain obvious unreachable code: there are no statements present after unconditional returns within the same block, conditional tests are not trivially constant-false/true from the shown context, and the functions using cached static values (get_cpu_core_count, get_process_cpu_core_count, get_num_threads) have reachable assignment and return paths. The uses of 'return ! 0' are unusual but evaluate to a valid reachable return value (1), so they are not unreachable-code issues. Therefore only the explicitly disabled #if 0 blocks are suspicious as they represent code excluded from the translation unit (i.e. unreachable at compile time) and should be investigated for compliance with Rule 2.1."
