  "scenario": "The fragment is inside a #if 0 / #endif block so the declaration is excluded by the preprocessor and not part of the translation unit. MISRA Rule 2.1 addresses code that is present in the built project but cannot be executed; code removed by the preprocessor is not \u2018\u2018unreachable code\u2019\u2019 in the compiled project. A concrete violation scenario would be code that is compiled but cannot be executed, e.g. statements placed after an unconditional return in the same function (or an if (0) { ... } block that is compiled), which would be unreachable and violate Rule 2.1."
