  "explanation": "- struct Session: expire_sessions accesses pos->next and pos->start. You must see the Session definition to know the types/sizes of these members (especially whether there are embedded character arrays or other members that could be subject to string operations or pointer/offset assumptions). This confirms that the function does not perform any string.h operations or out-of-bounds accesses on Session members.\n- sessions: the global head pointer that expire_sessions walks and updates. Knowing its declaration (type, linkage) and how Session nodes are allocated/owned is required to determine whether list traversal or node unlinking could cause accesses beyond object bounds (e.g. if nodes are subobjects or part of other buffers).\n- free: expire_sessions calls free(pos). Confirming the semantics and that no custom macro replaces free is needed to reason about deallocation/dangling-pointer issues which might later enable out-of-bounds string operations.\n- time: expire_sessions calls time(NULL) and compares now - pos->start. You need the time() prototype/semantics to confirm type compatibility and that no hidden string operations occur via wrappers.\n- time_t: the type of pos->start and now; knowing its width and signedness ensures the subtraction and comparison cannot produce undefined behavior that might mask or trigger unsafe pointer/offset calculations.\n- NULL: used in pointer comparisons. Confirming its definition ensures pointer comparisons are valid and not masking any integer/pointer misuse.\n\nNote: expire_sessions contains no calls to any <string.h> functions. The listed symbols are the minimal additional program elements required to verify that expire_sessions itself does not invoke string handling functions or perform any pointer/size operations that could lead to out-of-bounds string accesses."
