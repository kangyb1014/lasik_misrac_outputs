  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in the provided code. The expire_sessions function only traverses a linked list, uses time(), and calls free(); it does not call memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn. The struct Session definition includes fixed-size char arrays (sid, value_1, value_2), but mere declarations do not constitute uses of string handling functions and therefore are not within the scope of Rule 21.17. If other source files manipulate those arrays with standard string functions, those sites (not shown here) would need review, but based on the supplied code there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for this rule."
