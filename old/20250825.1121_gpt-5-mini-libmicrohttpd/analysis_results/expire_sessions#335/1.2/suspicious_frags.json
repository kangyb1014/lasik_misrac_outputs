  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler language extensions in the provided code. I inspected the fragment for common extension tokens and constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __declspec, __inline, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, GCC-style statement expressions, inline assembly, Microsoft-specific keywords, and other vendor-specific identifiers \u2014 none appear. The code uses only standard C constructs and standard library identifiers (time_t, time, NULL, free, struct pointers, pointer dereference and assignment, arithmetic, and control flow). Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions not to be used)."
