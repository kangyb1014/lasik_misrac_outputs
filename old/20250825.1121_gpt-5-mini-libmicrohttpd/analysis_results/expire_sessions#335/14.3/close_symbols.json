  "explanation": "To decide whether the while loop's controlling expression (NULL != pos) is an invariant, the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- sessions: The initial value assigned to pos comes from this global. Its declaration/storage-class (extern/static), and whether it is const/volatile or modified by other translation units determines whether pos can be non\u2011constant at runtime. If sessions were a constant/immutable symbol the loop could be invariant.\n\n- struct Session: The definition (fields and their types) is required to know the type of pos->next and pos->start. In particular, the type and qualifiers of the next field (e.g. pointer type, const, volatile) determine whether next can change and therefore whether pos can change during the loop. The start field type is needed to validate the time subtraction expression but not for the controlling expression directly.\n\n- time: The prototype/definition of time is needed to ensure the call has no unexpected side effects on global state used by the loop (for example, to confirm it is the standard function that only returns a time_t and does not alter sessions or pos). If time were a macro or custom function with side effects, the loop's invariance analysis could be affected.\n\n- time_t: The typedef/underlying type is required to check the subtraction (now - pos->start) and to reason whether that expression is constant or could vary; this supports establishing that loop body can alter state that may lead to pos becoming NULL.\n\n- free: The prototype/definition of free (or any replacement macro) is needed to ensure that freeing pos does not implicitly modify the controlling expression variable (e.g. via a custom free macro) and to confirm there are no unexpected side effects that would make the controlling expression invariant.\n\n- NULL: The definition of NULL (null pointer constant) is needed to confirm the comparison semantics used in the controlling expression and whether it might be a compile-time constant in the translation unit.\n\nThese symbols allow a precise determination of whether the loop condition depends on mutable state (pos/sessions/pos->next) or is effectively invariant (compile-time constant or never modified), which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions."
