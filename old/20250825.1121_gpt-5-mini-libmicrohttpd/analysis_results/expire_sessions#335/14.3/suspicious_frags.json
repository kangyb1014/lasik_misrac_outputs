  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is invariant. The possible controlling/conditional expressions and why they are not invariant:\n\n- while (NULL != pos): pos is initialized from sessions and is updated each iteration with pos = next; next is derived from pos->next. Therefore the controlling expression can change across iterations and is not invariant.\n\n- if (now - pos->start > 60 * 60): although 60 * 60 is a constant, the expression depends on pos->start (and pos changes per iteration), so the overall controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- if (NULL == prev): prev is initialized to NULL but then updated to pos in the else branch (prev = pos). Thus this test can evaluate differently during execution and is not invariant.\n\nThere are no do-while loops or intentionally infinite loops in this function that would invoke the rule exceptions. Consequently, there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
