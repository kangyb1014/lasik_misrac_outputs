  "explanation": "To determine whether expire_sessions violates the MISRA rule about modifying function parameters, the analyzer must confirm that no function parameter is being assigned to. The following symbols are needed:\n\n- sessions (global variable: struct Session *sessions): expire_sessions assigns to 'sessions' (sessions = pos->next). We need the declaration to confirm this is a global (or file-scope) object rather than a parameter \u2014 if it is global, assigning it does not violate the parameter-modification rule.\n\n- struct Session (definition, including fields 'next' and 'start'): the code accesses pos->next and pos->start; the structure layout shows that these are members (the types matter: next is a pointer, start is time_t). This confirms that pos/next/prev are local pointers to that struct and that member assignments are not assignments to function parameters.\n\n- free (prototype: void free(void *)): free(pos) is called. Knowing free's prototype confirms it takes its pointer by value (so the caller's pointer variable is not being modified by the call) and that expire_sessions is not attempting to modify a pointer parameter via a called function that takes a pointer-to-pointer.\n\n- time (prototype: time_t time(time_t *)) and time_t (typedef): time(NULL) is called. The prototype and typedef confirm passing NULL is acceptable and that time does not modify any parameter in expire_sessions. This helps ensure no hidden parameter modification is occurring through that call.\n\n- NULL (macro/constant): to confirm the semantics of passing NULL (e.g., to time) and comparisons against NULL in the function.\n\nWith these symbols the analyzer can verify that expire_sessions has no parameters (so cannot directly violate the rule) and that all assignments are to locals or globals (not to any function parameter), and that called functions do not implicitly modify caller parameters in a way that would be relevant to the MISRA rule."
