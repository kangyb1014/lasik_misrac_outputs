  "explanation": "To decide whether any code in expire_sessions is unreachable we must know how the list and the condition behave and whether the function itself is ever called. The listed symbols are needed for that analysis:\n\n- sessions: the global head pointer used by expire_sessions. We must know its declaration and any initialization/assignment sites to determine if the while loop can ever execute (i.e. whether sessions can be NULL or non-NULL at call sites).\n\n- struct Session: the complete structure definition is required to confirm the presence and types of the fields referenced in expire_sessions (start and next) and to understand any alignment/aliasing/side-effect issues that could affect reachability.\n\n- Session::start: the start field is used in the time comparison (now - pos->start). To determine if the if/else branches are ever taken (or always/never taken), we need to know how and where start is initialized/updated elsewhere in the program.\n\n- Session::next: the next field drives the list traversal. Its semantics (e.g. whether it can form cycles or always NULL-terminated) are necessary to determine whether the while loop can terminate or whether parts of the loop are unreachable.\n\n- time and time_t: expire_sessions calls time(NULL) and compares timestamps. You must know the semantics/return range of time (and the typedef of time_t) to reason about the comparison and whether it can be constant or always true/false for all sessions.\n\n- free: expire_sessions frees list nodes. Understanding free semantics (and whether a custom allocator or wrapper is used) matters to know whether freeing changes global state that affects reachability of subsequent code in this function or elsewhere.\n\n- NULL: confirmation of the NULL macro/definition (and any project-specific redefinitions) is needed to reason about pointer comparisons (NULL == pos etc.).\n\n- main: static call graph shows main calls expire_sessions; include main to inspect the call site(s) and verify whether expire_sessions is actually invoked in reachable code (e.g. not under conditional compilation or guarded by a condition that is always false).\n\n- add_new_users, init_data, update_directory, update_cached_response, deinit_data, run_mhd: these are representative symbols (from the program caller set) that are likely to allocate, populate, or mutate the sessions list and/or Session.start values. To determine whether the if-condition (now - pos->start > 60*60) can be either true or false at run time (and therefore whether the else branch, prev updates, and subsequent loop iterations are reachable), we must examine all functions that create or update Session instances and the sessions list. If those functions always initialize start to now (or always to a value that makes the condition constant), parts of expire_sessions could be unreachable. Conversely, if they sometimes set older timestamps, the branches are reachable.\n\nNote: the exact set of list-manipulating functions may differ in the full project; the above named functions are included because they appear in the provided static call graph and are plausible places where sessions are created/updated. Any other function that allocates or mutates 'sessions' or Session.start must also be provided for a complete reachability analysis."
