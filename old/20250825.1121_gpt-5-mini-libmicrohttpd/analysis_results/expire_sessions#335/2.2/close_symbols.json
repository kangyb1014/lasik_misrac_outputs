  "explanation": "For determining whether expire_sessions is dead code (i.e., its removal would not affect program behaviour) the analyzer needs more context than the function body alone: \n\n- sessions (global variable): expire_sessions mutates this global list. To know whether removing expire_sessions changes behaviour you must inspect every other use of the sessions variable (who reads it, who relies on its contents, whether it is observed externally). Without the definition and all uses of 'sessions' you cannot tell if removal has observable effects.\n\n- struct Session (type definition): The layout (fields and types) \u2014 in particular the presence and meaning of the 'start' and 'next' members \u2014 is required to understand what expire_sessions is removing and whether those members are relied on elsewhere (e.g., other fields may have side effects or lifetimes that matter).\n\n- allocation sites for struct Session (functions or call-sites that call malloc/calloc for Session nodes): You must know where Session nodes are allocated and how frequently to assess whether expiry affects resource usage (memory exhaustion) or timing behaviour. If sessions are never allocated, expire_sessions may be dead; if they are allocated, expiry may be required to prevent resource/resource-timing effects.\n\n- functions that insert/append/remove Session nodes (any function that modifies the sessions list): If other functions already remove stale entries or otherwise maintain the list, expire_sessions may be redundant. Conversely, if no other code removes old sessions, expire_sessions is meaningful. Inspecting these symbols reveals whether expire_sessions duplicates behaviour.\n\n- functions that read Session.start (any code that depends on session timestamps): expire_sessions uses start to determine expiry. If no other code depends on start or if start is never set, the expiry condition may be meaningless. Conversely, other code may rely on expired-ness being enforced; those dependents must be examined to determine observable effect.\n\n- time (symbol/implementation): expire_sessions calls time(NULL). To judge whether timing behaviour is relevant (note 1 of MISRA), you need to know how time() is provided (real time, stubbed, mocked) and whether time advances in the target environment; if time() is constant or never advances, expiry may never occur and the function could be effectively dead.\n\n- free (symbol/implementation): Freeing nodes changes memory state and may affect program behaviour (e.g., reuse of memory, destructors/cleanup if wrappers exist). You must confirm that free is the actual deallocator used and whether freeing has observable side effects in this project (custom wrappers, hooks, leak detectors).\n\n- any callers that depend on session expiry behavior (functions that assume expired entries removed): Even though main is a caller of expire_sessions, other higher-level behaviour may depend on the list being pruned at certain times (affecting timing, resource consumption, or functional behaviour). Identify symbols that rely on the list being pruned to assess whether removal of expire_sessions would change observable program behaviour.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and all call-sites/uses) lets the next agent determine whether expire_sessions is actually exercised and whether its removal would alter program behaviour (i.e., whether it is dead code under the MISRA rule)."
