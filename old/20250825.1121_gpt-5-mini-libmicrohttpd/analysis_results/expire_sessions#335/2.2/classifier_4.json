Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of expire_sessions:\n```c\nstatic void\nexpire_sessions (void)\n{\n  struct Session *pos;\n  struct Session *prev;\n  struct Session *next;\n  time_t now;\n\n  now = time (NULL);\n  prev = NULL;\n  pos = sessions;\n  while (NULL != pos)\n  {\n    next = pos->next;\n    if (now - pos->start > 60 * 60)\n    {\n      /* expire sessions after 1h */\n      if (NULL == prev)\n        sessions = pos->next;\n      else\n        prev->next = next;\n      free (pos);\n    }\n    else\n      prev = pos;\n    pos = next;\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nelse\n    prev = pos;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment 'prev = pos;' is executed when the current session is not expired to update the predecessor pointer for the next iteration. It is not dead code: removing this assignment would change program behaviour (e.g. with a list where the first node is not expired and the second node is expired, failing to update prev would cause incorrect list linking or a NULL dereference when removing the second node)."
