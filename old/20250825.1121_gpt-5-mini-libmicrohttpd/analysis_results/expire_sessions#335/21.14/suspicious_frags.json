  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code fragments. The expire_sessions function performs pointer/list manipulation, time arithmetic (time and time_t), and calls free; it does not perform any string comparisons. The struct Session contains char arrays (sid, value_1, value_2) but none of these are compared in the shown code. There are also no other string-comparison calls (e.g. strcmp/strncmp/memcmp) present in the supplied snippets. Therefore there are no fragments here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If memcmp usage exists elsewhere in the code base, it was not included in the provided fragments and should be checked separately."
