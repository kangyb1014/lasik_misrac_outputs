  "explanation": "- sessions: the global head pointer used by expire_sessions; knowing its declaration/type is needed to inspect what the list stores (e.g. whether it contains strings that might be compared).\n- struct Session: the full definition is required to see all member types (to determine whether any members are char* or string buffers that could be compared with memcmp elsewhere or via helpers).\n- Session::next: the list-link field actually dereferenced/modified in the function; its type must be known to confirm list-manipulation semantics and that no string comparison occurs here.\n- Session::start: the time field read and used in the age test; its type and units must be known to validate the time comparison logic (not directly related to memcmp but needed for complete analysis of the function behavior).\n- time: the standard/time function called to obtain now; include its symbol to ensure it is not a wrapper that might perform string comparisons (or be macro-replaced).\n- time_t: the typedef for the time value used in arithmetic; needed to ensure correct semantics of the time subtraction.\n- free: the deallocation function called on expired nodes; include to ensure it is not replaced by a custom routine that could internally use memcmp on node contents.\n- NULL: the null pointer macro used in comparisons; include to ensure consistent interpretation in the code context.\n- memcmp: the standard-library function that the MISRA rule forbids for comparing null-terminated strings; include its symbol so the analyzer can detect any direct or indirect uses (including aliases, wrappers, or macros) in the function or in any called/used symbols.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether expire_sessions or any of the data it manipulates use memcmp (directly or indirectly) to compare null-terminated strings."
