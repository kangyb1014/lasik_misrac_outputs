  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. The only places in this function where pointer types and pointer-to-object usages occur are the pointer declarations and the pointer/member assignments and deallocation shown above; those locations therefore need inspection for possible const qualification or const-correctness issues. Other lines in the function do not introduce pointer declarations or perform pointer-to-object assignments that affect const qualification and so are not relevant to this rule: for example, the local time_t declaration and its initialization (time_t now; now = time (NULL);), the loop/control expressions (while, if conditions that compute time differences), and the traversal assignments that merely advance iteration (e.g. pos = next;) do not by themselves indicate missing const qualifiers. Also, the structure member accesses that only read values (such as pos->start used in the time comparison) are read-only uses and do not by themselves imply a missing const qualification beyond the pointer declarations and assignments already listed. Note: the declaration of the external/global 'sessions' pointer is not present in this snippet \u2014 its definition should be checked separately for const qualification, but because it is not in the provided code, it was not included above."
