  "scenario": "Not violated in this context. 'next' is later assigned to prev->next (type struct Session *), so it cannot be safely changed to 'const struct Session *' without changing other code or performing a cast. A violation would occur if 'next' were only used for read-only access to the session objects and never assigned to a non-const pointer; in that case it should be declared as 'const struct Session *next;'."
