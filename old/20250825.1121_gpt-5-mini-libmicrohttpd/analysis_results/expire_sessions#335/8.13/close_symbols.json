  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointers in expire_sessions could/should be const-qualified we must know the concrete types and qualifiers involved and whether the code (or called APIs) mutates the objects:\n\n- struct Session (definition): shows the exact fields (especially the type of 'next' and of 'start') and any const/volatile qualifiers on members. Knowing the type of next (e.g. struct Session *) is necessary to determine whether prev->next = next writes to the object and therefore whether prev (or the pointees) can be const.\n\n- sessions (global variable declaration): reveals the declared type and qualifiers of the list head (e.g. 'struct Session *sessions', 'const struct Session *sessions', or 'volatile ...'). If sessions is modified here (sessions = pos->next) it cannot be a pointer-to-const, so its declaration is required.\n\n- free (prototype from <stdlib.h>): the signature (void free(void *)) is needed because calling free(pos) requires a non-const pointer; if pos were declared 'const struct Session *' a cast would be required to call free, which affects MISRA conformity. Knowing the exact prototype clarifies whether constness can be applied to pos without introducing casts.\n\n- time (prototype) and time_t (typedef): time_t is needed to know the type of pos->start (and compatibility of the subtraction/compare with now). This matters to see whether any pointer-to-members are modified or only read; if start is immutable or const-qualified in the struct definition that impacts whether pointers could be const.\n\nThese symbols provide the necessary declarations and qualifiers to judge whether pointers in expire_sessions could (or must not) be declared to point to const-qualified types without violating program behavior or introducing casts that conflict with MISRA C."
