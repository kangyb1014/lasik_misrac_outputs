Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of internal_suspend_connection_:\n```c\nvoid\ninternal_suspend_connection_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool);\n\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  mhd_assert ( (!

  "scenario": "The mhd_assert(NULL == daemon->worker_pool); call is a runtime diagnostic check \u2014 removing it would change program behaviour when the condition fails (the assertion handler may abort/log). Therefore this statement is not dead code and Rule 2.2 is not violated. (Note: if in the entire project mhd_assert is defined as a no-op in all build configurations, then the check would be compiled out everywhere and would effectively be dead; that would be a project-configuration issue, not visible from this single fragment.)"
