  "explanation": "The fragments listed above are places where operations (assertions, mutex operations, list removal/insertions, epoll state changes and epoll set manipulation) might be redundant or removable without affecting runtime behaviour in some configurations; they therefore warrant investigation for possible dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nWhy other fragments are NOT reported for investigation:\n- Variable declarations/initialization (e.g. struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;) are required to access and manipulate state and are not candidates for dead code.\n- The return statement inside the resuming branch is a control-flow operation that clearly affects behaviour and cannot be removed without changing function semantics.\n- DLL_remove / DLL_insert and the assignment connection->suspended = true are included above; other nearby operations that actually move the connection between lists or change its suspended/resuming flags have clear observable effects on program state and so are not considered dead as-is.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#if/#ifdef) themselves are compile-time constructs; code excluded by those macros is not executed; only the runtime branches and calls shown in the suspicious list could be executed yet potentially redundant.\n- Simple comments and the final function closing brace are not executable and therefore not relevant to Rule 2.2.\n\nIf you want, I can narrow the investigation to a smaller subset of these fragments or provide rationale for focusing on specific ones (e.g. assertions and mutex ops) based on build configurations and possible no-op implementations."
