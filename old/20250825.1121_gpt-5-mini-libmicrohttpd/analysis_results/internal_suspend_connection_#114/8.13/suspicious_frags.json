  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce non-const pointer parameters that could reasonably be made const. Specifically, many remaining statements modify the pointed-to objects (e.g. assignments to connection fields such as resuming, suspended, epoll_state) or perform bitwise/enum operations and checks that require mutable access; these therefore legitimately use non-const pointers. Other lines are simple scalar operations, macro invocations that do not pass pointer-to-data that could be const-qualified, or use NULL as an event pointer (intentional). The selected fragments cover all places in this function where non-const pointer variables or pointer arguments are obtained or passed and thus warrant inspection for possible const-qualification."
