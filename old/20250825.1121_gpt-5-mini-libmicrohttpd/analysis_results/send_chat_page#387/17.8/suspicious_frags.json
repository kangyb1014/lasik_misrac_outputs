  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8. The sole function parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *con'. The code does not assign to 'con', perform pointer arithmetic on it, or otherwise modify the parameter variable itself. Passing 'con' to MHD_queue_response is allowed under the rule because the object pointed to by a pointer parameter may be modified by callees; the prohibition is against modifying the pointer parameter itself (e.g. reassigning 'con' or performing operations that change its value). Other local variables (res, ret) are local and not function parameters. The use of CHAT_PAGE and the cast to (const void *) does not modify any function parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that contravene MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
