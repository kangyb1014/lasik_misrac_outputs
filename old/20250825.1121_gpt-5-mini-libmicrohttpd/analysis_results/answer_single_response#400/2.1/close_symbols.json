  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- MHD_queue_response (prototype and implementation / function attributes): To determine whether the call can return normally or is non-returning (e.g., declared noreturn, performs longjmp, infinite loop, or terminates the connection). If MHD_queue_response can never return, code after the call would be unreachable; conversely, if it always returns, the return in this function is reachable. You need the implementation or attributes to decide reachability.\n\n- resp_single (definition / value): This object is passed into MHD_queue_response. If resp_single can be a special sentinel (NULL or a value that triggers non-return behavior) or if its state affects MHD_queue_response behavior (causing immediate termination), that could affect whether subsequent code is reachable. Knowing its definition/value eliminates ambiguity.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET and MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD: The method comparison uses these symbols with strcmp. Their definitions (string literals or macros) are needed to confirm the comparisons are valid and not e.g. NULL or aliasing in a way that makes one branch impossible, which could render subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- strcmp (declaration / semantics): Although standard, an explicit declaration/implementation is required to be sure the comparison semantics are as expected (returning 0 for equality). If strcmp were redefined or wrapped to behave differently (unlikely but possible in embedded projects), branch reachability could change.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: These are the return values used by the function. To decide whether a return effectively stops further processing in the caller framework or maps to special behaviour, you need their definitions. Also to ensure there are no constant-expression relationships that make one branch redundant.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_OK: The response status passed to MHD_queue_response. Its definition is needed only to rule out unusual macros that could affect code flow analysis or be used in compile-time constant propagation that makes other code unreachable.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (definition): To understand the type returned by this function and the meaning of the constants (MHD_YES/MHD_NO etc.). This helps determine if returns are well-typed constants or if some constants are aliases that could change control-flow reasoning.\n\nRationale: MISRA's unreachable-code rule is a static-property check: you must be able to prove that a statement cannot be reached given the available symbols, macros, and called-function behaviors. The above symbols are the small set that can influence reachability within answer_single_response (the early-return based on *req_cls, the method comparisons, and the called function's ability to return). Providing these symbols to the next analyzer allows a precise determination whether any branch or statement in the function is provably unreachable."
