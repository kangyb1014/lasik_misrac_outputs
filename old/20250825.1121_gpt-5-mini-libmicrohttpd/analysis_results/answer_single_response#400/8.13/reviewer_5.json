The marker is never modified, so it should be const-qualified and the pointer stored should point to a const-qualified type. Casting to plain void* (and thus not using a const-qualified target type) circumvents const correctness and violates the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 8.13 asks that pointers be aimed at const-qualified types when that is feasible. In this callback the pointer type is imposed by the external API: req_cls has type void ** (and the callback must conform to that prototype). The code does not discard a const qualifier \u2014 marker is declared non-const and its address is cast to void *; no const is being dropped. Making marker const would indeed better express immutability, but doing so would force either (a) assigning a const int * into a plain void * (which would discard const and itself be problematic) or (b) changing the API/signature, neither of which is possible here without breaking the library contract. Because the pointer type is constrained by the external interface, the \u201cwhenever possible\u201d condition is not met in this context, so the reported violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is not valid. If desired, you can avoid ambiguity by using an explicit immutable sentinel that is stored/managed in a way compatible with the API (for example a non-const sentinel or dynamic storage), or document a justified deviation."
