Therefore the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (Note: if the function prototype is fixed by an external API that requires void *cls, the signature cannot be changed and this exception should be documented.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 8.13 encourages using const-qualified pointee types when that is feasible, but the callback signature here is dictated by the external API (libmicrohttpd) which requires void *cls. You cannot change the parameter type without breaking the required prototype. The code intentionally suppresses the unused-parameter warning with (void) cls; and so does not violate MISRA 8.13 in this context. If the function were under your control (i.e. not constrained by an external API), then declaring cls as const void * would be preferable, but that is not possible here."
