  "explanation": "The only use of <string.h> functions in this function is strcmp; that call may access memory via the 'method' pointer beyond its bounds if 'method' is NULL or not a properly terminated string (or otherwise points to a smaller buffer). The macros MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET and MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD are string literals (null-terminated) so passing them to strcmp is safe. Other fragments do not call any string.h functions and therefore cannot violate Rule 21.17: the (void) casts merely suppress unused-parameter warnings; assigning &marker to *req_cls is a pointer store that does not use string functions; the early return and the call to MHD_queue_response do not involve <string.h> operations. Consequently only the strcmp-based conditional needs further investigation."
