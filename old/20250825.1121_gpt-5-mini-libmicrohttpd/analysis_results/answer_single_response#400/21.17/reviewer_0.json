For example, if method == NULL (NULL dereference) or if method points to a character array that is not NUL-terminated within its allocation, strcmp will access memory beyond the object.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function answer_single_response:\n#define MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET \"GET\"\n...\n#define MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD \"HEAD\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The code calls strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET) and strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD) without first ensuring that 'method' is a valid, non-NULL, NUL-terminated character sequence. strcmp scans until it finds a NUL byte, so if 'method' is NULL this is a dereference (undefined behavior), and if 'method' does not contain a NUL within its accessible bounds strcmp may read beyond the object \u2014 exactly the situation MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is intended to forbid. (If there is a documented, guaranteed contract from the caller/library that 'method' is always non-NULL and NUL-terminated, that could justify the code; but nothing in the shown code enforces or documents that, so as presented it violates the rule.)"
