Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "You must include the following symbols to determine whether answer_single_response violates the MISRA C for-loop well-formedness rule because the rule requires inspecting the behaviour of any functions called within the loop body and all code actually executed by the target function: \n\n- MHD_queue_response: Direct callee from answer_single_response; any for loops inside it (or its callees) must be checked.\n- MHD_DLOG: Callee of MHD_queue_response; include its definition to inspect any for loops or side effects that would count as loop-body behaviour.\n- is_reply_body_needed: Callee of MHD_queue_response; may contain loops or side effects relevant to rule 2/3.\n- MHD_increment_response_rc: Callee of MHD_queue_response; include to inspect modifications to loop counters or other objects if used inside loops.\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle: Callee of MHD_queue_response; include for the same reason (may contain loops/side effects).\n- MHD_update_last_activity_: Callee of MHD_queue_response; include to inspect internal loops or modifications.\n- resp_single: Object passed to MHD_queue_response; its type/implementation may lead to functions being invoked (callbacks, destructors) that contain for loops or modify loop-control objects.\n- strcmp: Used in the target function\u2019s method checks. Although strcmp itself is not part of a for-statement here, include its implementation/semantics if analysis needs to consider side effects or calls within conditional expressions.\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD: Constants/macros used in the second-clause-style check of allowed methods; include to confirm they are simple constants (no side effects) so the conditional meets MISRA rule constraints about no persistent side effects.\n- MHD_HTTP_OK: Response code passed to MHD_queue_response; include to ensure it\u2019s a simple constant and not a macro with side effects.\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO: Enum/macros returned early from the function; include definitions to check they are simple values and do not hide side effects.\n- enum MHD_Result: Return type of answer_single_response; include to understand MHD_YES/MHD_NO/MHD queue semantics and any potential side-effecting macros associated with them.\n- struct MHD_Connection: Type of the connection parameter passed into MHD_queue_response; its definition may reveal callbacks or member functions invoked by callees that contain for loops or modify loop counters.\n\nRationale: answer_single_response itself contains no for loop, but MISRA's rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of a for-loop body. To be conservative and correct, we must analyze MHD_queue_response and all functions it calls, plus the relevant objects and constants passed into them, to detect any for loops and verify their clauses meet MISRA requirements. The listed symbols are the minimal set (from the static call graph and immediate parameters) required to perform that analysis."
