If the notify_completed callback is declared to take a non-const pointer (for example: void (*notify_completed)(void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *, void *client_context, enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode)) while it only needs to read the client_context, then the pointer type is not const-qualified even though it could be.

  "explanation": "The claim cannot be confirmed from the code shown. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is about the declarations of pointer types (they should be const-qualified when they need only to read the pointed-to object). The target snippet only shows a call: daemon->notify_completed (..., &connection->rq.client_context, ...); it does not show the declaration of daemon->notify_completed nor the type/intent of connection->rq.client_context. If notify_completed is declared to take a non-const pointer but the callback needs to modify the client_context (e.g. to clear or replace it), a non-const parameter is appropriate and there is no Rule 8.13 violation. If, on the other hand, the callback only reads the context then the callback prototype (and possibly the client_context member type) should be const-qualified \u2014 but that is a deficiency in the declaration, not something proven by the call site alone.\n\nAlso note that &connection->rq.client_context is a pointer-to-client_context (e.g. a void ** if client_context is void *), which is implicitly convertible to void * when passed to a parameter of type void *; whether that should be const (e.g. const void * or const void * const *) depends on the declared prototype and whether mutation is required.\n\nConclusion: there is insufficient evidence to assert a definite violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in the shown code. To decide you must inspect the declaration of notify_completed and the type/intended use of connection->rq.client_context."
