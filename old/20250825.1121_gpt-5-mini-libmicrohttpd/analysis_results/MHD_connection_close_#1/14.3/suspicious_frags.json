  "explanation": "I have listed all statements in the function that contain controlling expressions or could expand to controlling expressions (the mhd_assert() lines may expand to conditional code depending on build). There are no other if/for/while/do/conditional-operator controlling expressions in this function beyond the fragments shown. Preprocessor directives (#ifdef/#endif), simple assignments, function calls (e.g. MHD_connection_mark_closed_), and declarations are not controlling expressions and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C Rule 14.3."
