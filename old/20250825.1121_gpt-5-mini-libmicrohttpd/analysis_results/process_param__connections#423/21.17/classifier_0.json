  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from this single call. The fragment itself does not call any <string.h> function and therefore does not by itself violate Rule 21.17. A violation would occur if get_param_value internally uses string.h routines on the supplied pointers without ensuring the pointed-to objects are NUL-terminated and destination buffers are large enough. For example, if get_param_value does strlen(param_name) or strcpy(dest, param_name) while param_name is not NUL-terminated or dest is too small, that would read/write beyond object bounds and violate Rule 21.17."
