  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment as written does not call any function from <string.h>, so it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, if param_name is not a valid null-terminated string (e.g. points past the end of its object or is not terminated), then reading it with the \"%s\" specifier in fprintf would cause an out-of-bounds read. A concrete Rule 21.17 violation would occur if this code used a <string.h> function on the same invalid param_name (for example, strlen(param_name) or strcpy(dst, param_name)), which would directly be a string.h access beyond the bounds of the object."
