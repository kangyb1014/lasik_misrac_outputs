All other constructs in the function and related definitions use standard C (casts, pointer arithmetic, enums, stdint and size_t types, standard library calloc via MHD_calloc_, and ordinary macros). No other occurrences of __attribute__, typeof, asm, __extension__, __inline__ (non-standard spelling), or other compiler-specific keywords or extensions are present in the supplied fragments, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 1.2."
