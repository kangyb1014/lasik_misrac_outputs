  "explanation": "sha512_256_transform: The target calls this function from within its loop bodies (the while that processes full blocks). MISRA\u2019s rule treats the behaviour of a for-loop body as including any functions called within that statement, so you must inspect sha512_256_transform for any for-loops and verify their loop counters, side-effects and whether they (directly or indirectly) modify objects that would violate the rule.\n\n__builtin_rotateright64: A callee of sha512_256_transform according to the static graph. Although normally an intrinsic without loops, it must be inspected (or proven inert) because any function called (directly or transitively) from inside a for-loop contributes to the loop body behaviour.\n\n__builtin_bswap64: Same rationale as __builtin_rotateright64 \u2014 it is called by sha512_256_transform and must be checked (or demonstrated to have no loop/body side-effects) when evaluating for-loop well-formedness transitively.\n\nmemcpy: Used in MHD_SHA512_256_update. Even if currently invoked outside a for-statement here, memcpy could be called inside a for-loop in a called function (or be a macro that expands to code with loops). Include it to rule out/transitively confirm any loop behaviour or side-effects relevant to MISRA\u2019s for-loop clauses.\n\nmhd_assert: Macro used at function entry. Macros can expand into statements or function calls that affect analysis (e.g. hidden side-effects or loops). Verify its expansion doesn\u2019t introduce for-loops or modify potential loop counters.\n\nstruct Sha512_256Ctx: The full definition (fields: count, count_bits_hi, buffer, H, etc.) is required to determine which objects are modified inside loops (e.g. if a for-loop in a callee reads/writes ctx fields that serve as a loop counter or are modified in the outer function). MISRA forbids loop counters that are modified in the loop body \u2014 to check that, you must know which objects constitute loop counters and whether they are modified elsewhere.\n\nSHA512_256_BLOCK_SIZE: The block size constant governs loop bounds and calculations (bytes_have, bytes_left and the while condition). Its value (and whether it is a compile-time constant) matters when determining whether any for-loop conditions or increments could depend on objects modified in the loop body.\n\nSIZEOF_SIZE_T: Controls conditional compilation in the function (the #if SIZEOF_SIZE_T > 7 block). The presence or absence of that branch can change which code is compiled and thus whether particular loops (or modifications to counters) exist; therefore the configuration must be known for a complete MISRA analysis.\n\nUINT64_C: Used when masking ctx->count. If implemented as a macro or expression that could affect semantics (rare but possible), include it to be thorough when reasoning about variables that might be used as loop counters or be modified in loops.\n\nNote: The primary focus for MISRA Rule checking is sha512_256_transform (and its callees). The other listed symbols are included to ensure no hidden loops or side-effects (via macros, intrinsics or data-structure fields) change the classification of loop counters or introduce forbidden modifications in loop bodies."
