In this function MHD_SHA512_256_update the variable data is declared as const uint8_t *data. If sha512_256_transform is declared as, for example, void sha512_256_transform(uint64_t H[], uint8_t *block); then passing the const-qualified data discards constness and the pointer should instead be declared const (e.g. const uint8_t *block) to comply with Rule 8.13. If, however, sha512_256_transform already declares its parameter as const uint8_t * (or otherwise does not modify the pointed-to data), then no violation occurs.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s reasoning is correct in substance but the report as stated is not conclusively provable from the snippet alone. MISRA C:2023 R8.13 encourages pointer parameters to be const-qualified when they do not need to modify the pointed-to object. In MHD_SHA512_256_update the local parameter is declared const uint8_t *data and that pointer is passed to sha512_256_transform(ctx->H, data). If sha512_256_transform is prototyped to take uint8_t * (non-const) then that call would discard constness and indicate a violation (and, independent of MISRA, is an incompatible qualifier conversion without an explicit cast). Conversely, if sha512_256_transform is prototyped to accept const uint8_t * (or otherwise does not modify the data), then there is no R8.13 violation. Because the prototype of sha512_256_transform is not provided, you cannot determine definitively that the code violates R8.13; you can only say that a violation is possible if the transform function\u2019s parameter is non-const. Recommended fix: declare the transform parameter as const uint8_t * if it does not modify the input, and avoid casting away constness."
