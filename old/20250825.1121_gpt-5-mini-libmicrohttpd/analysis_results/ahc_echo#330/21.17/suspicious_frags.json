  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. In this function the only invocations of those functions are the listed strcmp and strlen calls; therefore those calls are the relevant places to investigate for potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds/string termination issues. Other code fragments in the function (casts, pointer assignments to req_cls, use of MHD_queue_response/MHD_destroy_response, the (void) unused parameter lines, and the struct definition) do not call <string.h> functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and do not need to be investigated for this specific rule."
