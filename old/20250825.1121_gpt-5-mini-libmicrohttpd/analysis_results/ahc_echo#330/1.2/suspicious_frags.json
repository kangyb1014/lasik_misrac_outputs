  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The following constructs that might look unusual are standard C, not extensions, so they do not trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2: - (void) parameter casts to suppress unused-parameter warnings. - Casting between void * and typed pointers (e.g. (struct handler_param *) cls). - Taking the address of a static local (static int aptr) and storing/comparing it via void * (via req_cls). - Adjacent string literal concatenation (the BUSYPAGE macro uses two quoted strings). - Use of enum, struct, #define macros and function calls. - No uses of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __extension__, GNU builtins, pragmas outside standard C, or other vendor-specific tokens. Therefore there are no code fragments to report for investigation under Rule 1.2."
