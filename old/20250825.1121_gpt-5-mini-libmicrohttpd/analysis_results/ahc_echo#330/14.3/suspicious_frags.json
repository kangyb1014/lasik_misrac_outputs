  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions (selection or iteration statements) need to be examined for Rule 14.3. The function contains no iteration statements (while/for/do-while) and no other selection statements beyond the three if-statements listed above, so there are no additional controlling expressions to inspect for invariance. Other code fragments (variable declarations, (void) casts to silence warnings, response construction and destruction, and the return statements) are not controlling expressions and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 14.3 and do not require investigation for this rule."
