The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "mhd_assert: Usually a macro (or inline) that expands into code. If its definition contains a for-statement (or any macro that expands to one) that for would become part of get_buffer_for_size at preprocessing/compilation time and must be inspected for MISRA well-formedness and side-effects.\n\n_MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE: Used both in the parameter declaration and in comparisons. It may be a simple constant or a macro/function-like expression. If it is a macro that expands to code (expressions with side effects, inline functions, or contains a for loop) that expansion could introduce loops or side effects affecting MISRA analysis.\n\n_MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE: Used in a boundary check. As with the other macro, its definition must be checked to ensure it is a pure constant and does not expand to code containing for loops or side effects that would affect MISRA rule checking.\n\nmalloc: The call appears in the function body and could be a macro or inline wrapper. If malloc is macro-wrapped in this codebase (or replaced by an inline allocator) that expansion could introduce a for loop into the function body; therefore the actual definition/wrapper must be inspected.\n\nfree: As with malloc, free might be macro-wrapped or implemented as an inline function; if so it could expand into code containing for loops or modify objects that matter for MISRA analysis and must be checked.\n\nNote: Standard library type names (size_t, char) and the pointer parameters themselves don\u2019t need extra definitions for the MISRA for-loop formation check unless any of the above symbols are macro/inline definitions that expand into for-statements."
