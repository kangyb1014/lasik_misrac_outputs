  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided function. Reasoning: the mhd_assert macro is defined as ((void)0), so the three assert lines are no-ops rather than producing unreachable code. Each conditional path in the function can be taken for some valid combination of inputs:\n- The first branch (return tmp1) is reachable when required_size <= _MHD_STATIC_UNQ_BUFFER_SIZE (128).  \n- The second branch (return *ptmp2) is reachable when *ptmp2_size >= required_size (possible when *ptmp2_size > 128 per the intended invariant).  \n- The return NULL branch is reachable when required_size > _MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_MAX_PARAM_SIZE (65535).  \n- The path that frees and reallocates *ptmp2 is reachable when required_size is greater than *ptmp2_size but not greater than the max param size.\nAll statements after these conditional checks are reachable via appropriate inputs (e.g., allocation success/failure). Therefore there are no fragments that are provably unreachable and no code in the function needs further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 based on the given definitions."
