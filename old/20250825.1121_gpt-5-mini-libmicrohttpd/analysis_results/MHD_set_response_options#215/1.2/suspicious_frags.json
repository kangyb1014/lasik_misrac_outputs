  "explanation": "Only compiler-specific language extension present is the use of GCC-style attributes via __attribute__((visibility(\"default\"))) (exposed through the _MHD_EXTERN macro) and its use as a storage-class/visibility specifier on the function declaration. Other constructs in the provided code (enum definitions, bit-shift flag constants, va_list/va_start/va_arg/va_end usage, bitwise operations, returns, pointer usage, switch/case, etc.) are standard C language features and are not compiler extensions. No other explicit compiler-specific keywords or builtins (for example other __attribute__ usages, __builtin_* functions, pragma with vendor extension, asm statements, or nonstandard storage-class specifiers) appear in the supplied snippets, so they do not need investigation under Rule 1.2."
