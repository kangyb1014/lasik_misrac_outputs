  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C recursion (no direct or indirect self-calls) we must be certain that none of the identifiers used in MHD_set_response_options expand to or call functions that could (directly or indirectly) call MHD_set_response_options. The symbols listed are required for that verification:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: its definition is needed to confirm that accessing/assigning members (flags_auto, flags, total_size) are plain data accesses and not implemented via macros or hidden function calls or triggers (e.g. accessor macros or thunking). If any member access expands to a function call, that could introduce an indirect call path.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseFlags: the flags type definition is required to check whether any flag names are actually implemented as macros or inline functions that could call functions.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions and MHD_RO_END: the varargs loop uses MHD_RO_END as sentinel. We must ensure these are plain enum constants and not macros or functions; if the sentinel or option values are macros that evaluate to function calls, they could introduce calls.\n\n- MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE, MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH: the three flag symbols used in conditional tests need inspection to confirm they are simple integer constants/macros and not function-like macros or wrappers that invoke code.\n\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO: return values used by the function \u2014 verify they are simple enum constants/macros and not function-like constructs that may call functions.\n\n- MHD_EXTERN: the function linkage/storage-class macro may expand to attributes; check it does not expand to a call or wrapper that would create an indirect call to this function.\n\n- va_start, va_arg, va_end and <stdarg.h>: the varargs macros come from <stdarg.h>. Include these to confirm their expansions on the target platform do not invoke functions (they are macros/constructs, but verifying their definitions closes a potential indirect-call route).\n\nIf all of the above are plain enums/macros/struct members (no function-like expansions, no inline functions that call other functions), then MHD_set_response_options performs no function calls and cannot call itself directly or indirectly. If any of the above expand to or invoke functions, those functions must be followed (their call graph inspected) to determine whether they reach MHD_set_response_options."
