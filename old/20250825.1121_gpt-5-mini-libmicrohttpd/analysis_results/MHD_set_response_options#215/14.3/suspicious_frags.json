  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant (constant) in this function. Reasons why other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 14.3: \n\n- if (0 != (response->flags_auto & MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH)) and the nested ifs: these conditions depend on runtime fields (response->flags_auto, response->flags) and the function parameter flags, so they are not invariant.\n\n- if ((0 != (flags & MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE)) && (0 != response->total_size)): both operands use runtime values (flags, response->total_size), so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- while (MHD_RO_END != (ro = va_arg (ap, enum MHD_ResponseOptions))): the loop condition depends on the value returned by va_arg at runtime (assigned to ro), so it is not a compile-time invariant. (Even if va_arg yields MHD_RO_END immediately at runtime, that is a runtime outcome, not a statically invariant controlling expression.)\n\n- switch (ro): the switch expression is the variable ro, which is assigned at runtime; it is not an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- There are no for-loops or do-while loops with a compile-time constant controlling expression, nor any explicit constant-true/constant-false if conditions that would constitute an invariant controlling expression under Rule 14.3.\n\nTherefore, no code fragments in this function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
