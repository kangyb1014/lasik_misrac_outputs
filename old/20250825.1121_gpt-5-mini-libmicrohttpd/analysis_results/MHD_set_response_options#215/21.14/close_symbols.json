  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to decide if this function (or code reachable from it) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings:\n\n- memcmp: the exact standard library function named in the rule; the analysis must locate any direct uses of memcmp reachable from the target function.\n- MHD_memcmp, mhd_memcmp, memcmp_s: project-specific wrappers or alternate names that may call or replace memcmp; they must be inspected because a wrapper may perform an unsafe memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n- struct MHD_Response: the definition of this struct is needed to determine the types of fields (pointers vs buffers) and whether any of its fields are NUL\u2011terminated strings that could later be (mis)compared with memcmp.\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions and MHD_RO_END: the varargs loop reads enum values; knowing the enum and sentinel values is needed to understand possible vararg values (which could include string pointers passed on to downstream code that might call memcmp).\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE: these flag macros/constants control the function\u2019s control flow. Full control\u2011flow understanding is required to know which code paths are reachable and whether those paths lead to code that uses memcmp on strings.\n- va_start, va_arg, va_end: the function uses varargs; these macros indicate that callers can pass arbitrary additional arguments (possibly string pointers). To determine whether memcmp is ever used to compare such NUL\u2011terminated strings you must examine how the varargs are consumed and what downstream functions (or wrappers) use them.\n\nIncluding these symbols in the next agent\u2019s context lets it (1) find any direct or indirect uses of memcmp, (2) identify wrapper/alias calls, (3) reason about the types/semantics of the data passed around (struct fields and varargs), and (4) determine whether any memcmp usage compares NUL\u2011terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
