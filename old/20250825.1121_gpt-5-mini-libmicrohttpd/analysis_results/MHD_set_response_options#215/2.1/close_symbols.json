  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for MISRA C unreachable-code analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Response\n  - The function reads response->flags_auto, response->flags and response->total_size. You must see the definition (types and possible invariants) to determine whether the early return branches can ever be taken (which could make later code unreachable) and whether reads can produce any value combinations that make parts of the function unreachable.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseFlags\n  - The checks against response->flags and the flags parameter use these enumerators (bit-masks). To decide if the conditionals (and corresponding early returns) are ever true or always true/false, you need the exact enumerator values and semantics.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH\n  - Used to guard the block testing removal of certain flags. Knowing its value and semantics (bit position, when it can be set) is necessary to determine whether that whole branch can be executed or is unreachable.\n\n- MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH\n  - Appears in multiple conditionals that can cause early returns. Its concrete value and relation to other flags is required to reason about reachability of subsequent statements.\n\n- MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE\n  - Likewise used in conditionals that may cause early returns; needed to decide whether subsequent code can be reached.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions\n  - The variadic loop pulls values of this enum type. To decide if the switch case labeled MHD_RO_END inside the loop is reachable (or provably unreachable), you must know this enum's definition and representable values.\n\n- MHD_RO_END\n  - The loop condition is while (MHD_RO_END != (ro = va_arg(...))). The switch contains case MHD_RO_END with a comment \"Not possible\". To determine if that case is indeed unreachable (and thus a MISRA violation) you need the exact value and intended use of MHD_RO_END.\n\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO\n  - The function returns these values and assigns ret. To reason about control-flow and which returns are reachable (and whether some return statements render later code unreachable), you need the canonical meanings/values of these result symbols.\n\n- call sites of MHD_set_response_options (callers and how they pass the variadic arguments)\n  - Crucial for the variadic loop: MISRA analysis must know how callers actually invoke this function (do they always supply a terminating MHD_RO_END, do they pass enum values or ints, do they pass other object types). In C variadic functions, argument promotions (enum -> int) and the exact types passed by callers affect what va_arg yields. If callers pass values that could cause va_arg to produce MHD_RO_END inside the loop body (or if callers violate the expected type), the apparently unreachable case label might in practice be reachable. Therefore examining call sites is required to prove/unprove reachability.\n\nNotes on the va_arg/detail that will be needed during analysis:\n- The analysis must consider C's default argument promotions for variadic calls (enumeration types are passed as int) and whether the function uses va_arg with the correct type. If there is a mismatch between what callers pass and the va_arg type, that can make the switch label behavior different and affect reachability; the enum definition plus caller usage are needed to prove this.\n\nProviding the above symbols (definitions and representative call sites) will allow a precise determination whether any statements or labels in MHD_set_response_options are provably unreachable under the project's code and calling conventions (and thus whether a MISRA unreachable-code violation exists)."
