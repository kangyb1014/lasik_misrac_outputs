  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for a MISRA <string.h> bounds-access analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The target function reads response->flags_auto, response->flags and response->total_size. To determine whether any of those fields are pointers or buffer descriptors that could be later passed to string functions (or whether their types/bitfields could affect boolean tests and control flow), the exact struct definition and field types are required.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseFlags: The function uses the parameter 'flags' of that enum type and assigns it into response->flags. Knowing the enum definition and its underlying integer type is necessary to reason about promotions, bit tests, and any semantics that might cause later code to pass response->flags-derived values to string functions.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE: These flag macros/consts drive conditional branches that change behavior (including early returns). Their exact definitions are needed to verify whether branches that would cause subsequent operations (possibly invoking string functions elsewhere) are reachable. They also show which bits are tested and whether tests could be mis-typed or subject to undefined behavior.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions (complete): The function consumes a varargs sequence of these options until MHD_RO_END. To determine whether reading the varargs as enum values is safe and whether any of the options expect subsequent arguments that are pointers/lengths (which could be passed to string.h routines elsewhere), you must have the full enum and the calling convention for each enumerator (which enumerators are followed by pointer/size arguments, and of what type). This is essential because a mismatch between what the caller supplies and what this function expects can lead to reading/writing beyond object bounds or later passing invalid pointers to string functions.\n\n- MHD_RO_END: The sentinel terminates the varargs loop. If its value or position in the enum is unclear, you cannot determine whether the loop will stop correctly or could run off the supplied arguments (which could result in reading arbitrary memory and later accidental use of garbage pointers in string functions). Knowing the exact sentinel value and its intended use is required to check for out-of-bounds vararg consumption.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO): Knowing the return-value enumerators is needed to understand control-flow outcomes (early returns vs. full parsing of varargs). That affects whether code paths that might trigger string operations (in callers or subsequent code) are reachable.\n\nIn summary: because the function uses a varargs protocol driven by enum MHD_ResponseOptions and manipulates fields of struct MHD_Response controlled by flag constants, the complete definitions of the struct, enums, and flag constants (and the per-enumerator vararg signatures) are required to prove that no string.h function will be invoked with out-of-bounds pointers as a consequence of this function's behavior."
