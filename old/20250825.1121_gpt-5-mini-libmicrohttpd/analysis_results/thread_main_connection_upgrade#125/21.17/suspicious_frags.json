  "explanation": "I flagged every direct use of the string.h function 'memset' and the FD_ZERO calls (FD_ZERO commonly expands to a memset on fd_set), because these are the direct places where <string.h> functions may be invoked and could lead to out-of-bounds accesses if sizes or targets are incorrect. I also flagged calls that pass fd_set or buffer/array pointers into helper functions (urh_to_fdset, urh_from_fdset, urh_update_pollfd, urh_from_pollfd) because those functions may internally use string.h routines (memset/memcpy/etc.) and need inspection to ensure their pointer/size usage cannot overflow the referenced objects.\n\nNo other occurrences of the string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the shown code. Calls such as MHD_SYS_select_/select, MHD_sys_poll_/poll, logging/print macros, simple assignments, and control-flow constructs do not themselves invoke the string.h routines and so were not included. The explicit memset use and the fd_set-related operations are the only sites in this function that warrant investigation for potential out-of-bounds accesses related to <string.h> usage."
