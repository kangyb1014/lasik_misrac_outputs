  "explanation": "For MISRA rule 'controlling expressions shall not be invariant' we must determine whether the loop condition expressions can change during execution. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle and its fields (in_buffer_size, out_buffer_size, in_buffer_used, out_buffer_used): these four fields form the controlling Boolean expressions of the outer while loops; their mutability/volatility and the routines that update them determine whether the control expression is invariant.\n- MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle::connection->socket_fd and MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle::mhd.socket: these file descriptors are used to prepare fd/poll sets and may influence whether data is received; understanding them is necessary to see if I/O alters the buffer fields used in the loop condition.\n- urh_to_fdset, urh_from_fdset, process_urh, urh_update_pollfd: these functions are invoked inside the loops and are the most likely places that modify the urh buffer fields (in_buffer_used/out_buffer_used) or connection state. To decide if the loop's controlling expression is invariant you must know whether these functions can change the fields involved in the condition.\n- struct MHD_Connection and its fields (urh, daemon, tls_read_ready, tid): the code reads con->tls_read_ready and uses con->urh and con->daemon; tls_read_ready participates in the decision whether to block (affects select/poll timeout) and may be changed elsewhere \u2014 knowing its semantics is needed to decide if the controlling expressions can vary.\n- struct MHD_Daemon and its fields (options, shutdown): daemon->options selects TLS/select/poll paths (affects which loop runs) and daemon->shutdown is tested inside the loop condition/timeout logic; their mutability (e.g. set by another thread) affects invariance.\n- MHD_USE_TLS, MHD_D_IS_USING_SELECT_, MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_: these macros/ predicates determine which code paths and loops execute; they are necessary to know whether the loops are compiled/active and whether assertions/threads affect state changes.\n- MHD_thread_handle_ID_is_current_thread_: used in the assert about threading; thread model affects whether other threads can update fields used in the loop \u2014 needed to judge whether a controlling expression might change asynchronously.\n- MHD_SYS_select_, MHD_sys_poll_, MHD_socket_get_error_, MHD_SCKT_ERR_IS_EINTR_, MHD_socket_strerr_: select/poll/syscall results control loop flow (break/continue) and can be the mechanism that causes state changes (via I/O). Understanding their semantics helps decide whether the loop condition is effectively invariant or can change due to I/O or errors.\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET and FD_SETSIZE: constants used to decide whether select is called; these determine whether the code branches to waiting or skipping waits \u2014 affect the timing of possible changes to the controlling variables.\n- MHD_connection_finish_forward_: called after the TLS forwarding loop; its behavior may further rely on state left after the loops and is included for completeness when reasoning about lifecycle and whether the loop must terminate.\n\nIn short: to decide if the while(...) controlling expressions are invariant you must know the types and mutability of the urh buffer counters and daemon/connection flags, and whether any functions called in the loop (urh_* and process_urh) or external threads/syscalls can alter those fields. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to perform that analysis."
