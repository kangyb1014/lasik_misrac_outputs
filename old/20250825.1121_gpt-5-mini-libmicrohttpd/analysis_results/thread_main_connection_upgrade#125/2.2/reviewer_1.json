  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The final statement MHD_connection_finish_forward_(con) expands to (void)con, which has no observable effect at run-time for the given declaration (struct MHD_Connection *con). It is executed (reachable) but its removal would not change program behaviour, so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The fact that MHD_DLOG calls can be no-ops when logging is disabled is an additional but separate issue. Caveat: if the macro were conditionally defined elsewhere in the project to perform meaningful actions (i.e. different build configurations where the macro is non\u2011trivial), then the call might not be dead across the whole project; based on the provided definition, however, the report is correct."
