  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (memcmp must not be used to compare null-terminated strings) we need the implementation or type/layout of any callee or data structure that could perform string comparisons or provide buffers that might be treated as NUL-terminated strings:\n\n- process_urh: This is the principal data-processing routine called in the loop. It may inspect/parse HTTP headers or other textual data and is the most likely place memcmp could be used to compare strings. Its body must be examined for memcmp usage and for whether it compares NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- urh_to_fdset / urh_from_fdset / urh_update_pollfd / urh_from_pollfd: These urh_* helpers manipulate the upgrade response handle\u2019s buffers and I/O descriptors. While they primarily prepare fd_sets/pollfd or move data, they may also touch buffer contents or perform small comparisons; include them to ensure no memcmp-on-strings occurs there.\n\n- MHD_connection_finish_forward_: Cleanup related to the forwarding path could touch the urh or connection buffers; include to check for any string comparisons during teardown.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: Logging helpers may format or compare strings; include to verify they do not use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings when logging messages or errors invoked from this function.\n\n- MHD_socket_strerr_: Converts error codes to strings; its implementation may call string functions \u2014 include to ensure no memcmp misuse.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: The urh fields used in the loop (in_buffer_size, out_buffer_size, in_buffer_used, out_buffer_used, connection->socket_fd, mhd.socket, etc.) must be known to determine whether the buffers are binary/ring buffers (not NUL-terminated) or are C strings; this determines whether any memcmp use would be comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: Fields accessed here (urh, daemon, tls_read_ready, tid) must be inspected to know buffer ownership/lifetimes and whether any higher-level code treats the buffers as strings.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: Fields used (options, shutdown and macros like MHD_USE_TLS / selection mode) are needed to understand which code paths run; also to inspect any helper functions reachable through daemon that might perform string comparisons.\n\nThese symbols (the processing helpers and the relevant data structure definitions) are sufficient to locate any use of memcmp in the control flow started by thread_main_connection_upgrade and to determine whether such memcmp calls compare null-terminated strings or operate on known-length buffers."
