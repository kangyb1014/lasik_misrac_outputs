  "explanation": "No use of the standard library function memcmp appears anywhere in the provided code. The function MHD_socket_noninheritable_ only calls fcntl (POSIX path) and SetHandleInformation (Windows path) and performs integer comparisons and bitwise operations (e.g. checks against -1, compares flag values, tests return values). There are no string operations or comparisons of null-terminated strings, and no calls to memcmp in either conditional compilation branch. The provided macro definition (MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS) only determines which branch would be compiled; it does not introduce memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
