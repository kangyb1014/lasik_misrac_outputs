  "explanation": "I found no uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the provided function. The function only calls fcntl (POSIX) and SetHandleInformation (Windows) and performs integer/bitwise operations on an int-typed MHD_socket; there are no buffer or pointer parameters passed to any string-manipulation routine. Given the typedef of MHD_socket as int and the provided macro definition, there are no other hidden string operations or pointer buffers in this snippet that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses governed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report."
