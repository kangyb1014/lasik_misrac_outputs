  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check the <string.h> rule for MHD_socket_noninheritable_:\n\n- fcntl: This is the POSIX function the code calls. You must inspect its prototype and documented behavior to confirm it does not accept or forward char*/buffer pointers (and thus cannot directly invoke string.h routines on caller-provided buffers). Also check whether any platform wrapper used in this project might wrap fcntl and call string functions.\n\n- F_GETFD, F_SETFD: These constants determine which fcntl command is used. Knowing the exact command semantics ensures fcntl is used only to get/set integer descriptor flags (no buffer/string parameters).\n\n- FD_CLOEXEC: Flag value combined with the flags variable. Confirming this is an integer flag shows the code manipulates integers/bitmasks only (no string/buffer access).\n\n- SetHandleInformation: This is the Windows API call used in the alternative branch. Inspect its prototype to ensure it does not take pointer/buffer parameters from the caller that could trigger string handling operations.\n\n- HANDLE: The typecast (HANDLE) sock means the socket is being passed as a handle type on Windows. You need the definition/type to confirm that this cast does not hide passing pointer to a buffer or string.\n\n- HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT: The constant used with SetHandleInformation. Confirming it is an integer flag shows only integer/bitmask operations are performed (no buffer/string access).\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS, MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: These compile-time macros control which branch of the code is compiled. To verify the rule for the actual build configuration, you must know which macro is defined (or whether either branch can bring in code that uses string functions).\n\n- MHD_socket: The typedef/type of the sock parameter. You need its definition to ensure it is not a pointer to a buffer or string (for example, some projects typedef socket handles to pointer types); if it were a char* or struct containing char* that could implicate string handling.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule concerns use of standard string.h functions and out-of-bounds buffer accesses. To prove MHD_socket_noninheritable_ does not violate that rule you must confirm every symbol it uses (and the compile-time branches controlled by macros) operate only on integer/handle values and do not accept or forward char*/buffer pointers or internally call string.h routines in a way that relies on caller buffers. The listed symbols are the minimal items needed to make that determination."
