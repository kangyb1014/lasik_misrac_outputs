Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- fcntl\n  - The target calls fcntl; you must know its semantic side-effects (which objects it modifies) to decide if calling this function inside a for-loop body would violate the rule (the rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body).\n\n- F_GETFD, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC\n  - The flag constants control which fcntl operation is performed and what is written. Understanding these values helps determine whether the call modifies any C-level object that could be used as a loop counter or loop-control object.\n\n- SetHandleInformation\n  - On Windows branch the target calls this API. Its side-effects (what it modifies) must be known to assess whether it affects objects relevant to for-loop well-formedness when the target is invoked from a loop.\n\n- HANDLE, HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT\n  - Types/flags used with SetHandleInformation; needed to understand the Windows-branch side-effects and whether any C-level object passed from a loop could be modified.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef)\n  - The parameter type determines whether 'sock' is an integer, pointer or other; needed to decide if the function can modify a caller's loop counter object (e.g. if a loop variable of same type is passed by value or by reference elsewhere).\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS, MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS (compile-time macros)\n  - Which branch of the function is compiled matters: you must know which platform path is active to determine which calls/side-effects are relevant to loop analysis.\n\n- MHD_add_connection, MHD_accept_connection, MHD_socket_create_listen_\n  - They are the static callers of the target. To decide if the target participates in a for-loop body that could violate the MISRA rule you must inspect these callers for for-statements that call the target and examine their loop counters/flags and how they interact with this function.\n\n- MHD_cleanup_connections, MHD_DLOG, MHD_socket_nonblocking_, internal_add_connection, __builtin_unreachable\n  - These are direct callees of the callers above (from the static graph). The callers may call these functions inside loops; their behaviour (side-effects, which objects they modify) can affect whether a surrounding for-loop is well-formed (the rule forbids loop-body side-effects on objects used in loop control).\n\n- internal_run_from_select, MHD_poll_all, MHD_poll_listen_socket, MHD_epoll, MHD_start_daemon_va\n  - Higher-level callers shown in the static graph. You need their definitions/control flow if they contain for-loops (or call the above caller functions inside loops). They may establish loop counters or pass objects into loops that are later modified by the target.\n\nIn short: include the OS API symbols used by the target to determine the function's side-effects, the typedef/macro symbols that select which branch is active, and the caller/callee symbols from the static call graph so you can inspect any for-loops that call the target (and any functions those loops call) to decide compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule."
