  "explanation": "No pointer declarations or pointer-typed variables appear in the provided code fragment. The function parameter MHD_socket sock is used as an integer/handle value (passed to fcntl or cast to HANDLE) rather than as a pointer, so Rule 8.13 (requirement that pointers point to const-qualified types where possible) is not applicable. The only cast of note is (HANDLE) sock; if HANDLE is an opaque handle type (as in WinAPI) it is intended to identify a mutable resource and cannot reasonably be const-qualified. All other uses (flags, return values, macros) are non-pointer value types, so there are no pointer-to-non-const occurrences that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
