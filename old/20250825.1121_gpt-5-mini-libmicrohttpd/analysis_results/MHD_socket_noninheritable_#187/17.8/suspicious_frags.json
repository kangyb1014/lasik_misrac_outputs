  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameter is declared as 'MHD_socket sock' and is only used as a value argument in calls (fcntl and SetHandleInformation) and in a cast ((HANDLE) sock). There are no assignments to 'sock', no increments/decrements, no use of the address-of operator (&sock) nor passing a pointer-to-sock that could modify the parameter itself. The only assignments occur to the local variable 'flags', which is not a function parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
