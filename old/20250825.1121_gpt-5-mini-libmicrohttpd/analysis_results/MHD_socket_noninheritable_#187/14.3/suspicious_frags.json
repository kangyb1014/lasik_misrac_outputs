  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. Details:\n- The #if/#elif preprocessing directives (defined(MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS) / defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)) are preprocessor conditionals, not C controlling expressions covered by Rule 14.3.\n- In the POSIX branch, flags is assigned from fcntl(sock, F_GETFD); the subsequent if (-1 == flags) uses a runtime value, so it is not invariant.\n- The combined if in the POSIX branch ((flags | FD_CLOEXEC) != flags) && (0 != fcntl(...)) depends on the runtime value of flags and on the return of fcntl, so it is not invariant.\n- In the Windows branch, if (! SetHandleInformation(...)) depends on the runtime result of SetHandleInformation, so it is not invariant.\n- There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch statements with constant controlling expressions. The final return ! 0 is a constant expression but it is not a controlling expression and therefore not in scope of Rule 14.3.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
