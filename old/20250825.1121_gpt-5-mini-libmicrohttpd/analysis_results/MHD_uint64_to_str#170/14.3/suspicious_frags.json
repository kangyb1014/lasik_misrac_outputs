  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. Each loop/selection expression depends on variables that are modified inside the loop bodies or before the next evaluation:\n\n- while ((0 == digit) && (1 < divisor)): both 'digit' and 'divisor' are updated inside the loop (divisor /= 10; digit = (int) (val / divisor)), so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- while (0 != buf_size): 'buf_size' is decremented each iteration (buf_size--), so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- if (1 == divisor): this is evaluated inside the second loop after divisor has been changed earlier in the loop; it is not a compile-time constant invariant.\n\nThere are no do-while loops with an integer constant controlling expression, nor any intentionally infinite loops using a constant true controlling expression (the permitted exception). The mhd_assert macro is defined as ((void)0) and does not affect control expressions. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
