  "explanation": "- build_header_response: The immediate caller that passes buf and buf_size into MHD_uint64_to_str. You must inspect its source to see how the target function's buffer pointer and size are produced (stack/local buffer, pointer into a larger buffer, or size computed), and whether the supplied buf_size is guaranteed to be >= the maximum digits (20) required to represent a uint64_t in decimal.\n- transmit_error_response_len and MHD_connection_handle_idle: These callers of build_header_response can provide the higher-level call context and allocation strategy (pool/stack/connection buffers). If build_header_response obtains its buffers from caller-provided structures, the callers' code may determine the buffer lifetime/size constraints.\n- buffer_append and connection_maximize_write_buffer: Functions that build_header_response calls to manage or expand output buffers. Their behavior (whether they reallocate/ensure space, or return truncated buffers) affects whether the buf and buf_size passed to MHD_uint64_to_str can legitimately be too small, leading to out-of-bounds writes.\n- mhd_assert: The assertion macro/function used inside MHD_uint64_to_str. Its definition matters because if it aborts the program on violation or is compiled out, it changes whether certain illegal states are prevented at runtime or remain unchecked for static analysis.\n- definitions of the local buffers/size constants used by build_header_response (e.g. any fixed-size char arrays or size_t constants passed as buf_size): Concrete declarations (names and sizes) are required to determine whether the buffer provided to MHD_uint64_to_str is large enough (at least 20 bytes for the largest uint64 decimal) or whether buf_size can be zero/too small.\n- UINT64_C (from <stdint.h>): The macro determines the exact type/constant used for the initial divisor, but mainly to confirm the assumed maximum magnitude (10^19) and to ensure any platform-specific semantics do not change the control flow.\n\nProviding these symbols/source snippets will allow the next agent to determine whether the calls that produce buf and buf_size guarantee sufficient buffer length and thus whether any writes in MHD_uint64_to_str can access memory beyond the bounds of the supplied object (the MISRA <string.h> bounds concern here maps to any writes via buf/chr)."
