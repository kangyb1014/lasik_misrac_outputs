  "explanation": "- build_header_response: This is the direct caller of MHD_uint64_to_str. To decide whether any branch/return in MHD_uint64_to_str is actually unreachable in the project you must inspect how build_header_response computes and passes the buf and buf_size arguments (and the val argument). If build_header_response always passes a buffer large enough (or never calls with buf_size==0) some code paths (e.g. the final \"return 0;\" or the while loop body) might be provably unreachable.\n\n- transmit_error_response_len and MHD_connection_handle_idle: These are callers of build_header_response (shown in the static call graph). To reason transitively about constraints on the arguments that reach MHD_uint64_to_str you may need to inspect these callers as well \u2014 they may determine the sizes/conditions with which build_header_response is invoked and thus influence reachability of code inside MHD_uint64_to_str.\n\n- mhd_assert: The macro/function used for runtime assertions appears repeatedly in the function. Its definition may alter control flow (e.g. abort(), longjmp, or being a no-op in release builds). To determine whether code following an assertion is reachable you must know the exact definition/expansion used in the project.\n\n- UINT64_C: This macro defines the initial divisor constant (10000000000000000000). To reason statically about the digit/divisor loops and whether some loops/branches can or cannot be taken, you need the precise value/expansion of this macro.\n\n(Standard integer types such as uint64_t and size_t are assumed available from headers and do not by themselves affect reachability; the listed symbols are those needed to determine argument constraints and any assertion-induced control-flow changes.)"
