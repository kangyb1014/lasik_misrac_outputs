  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or attributes (for example: __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, typeof, __builtin_*) are present.\n- The use of uint64_t and UINT64_C is standard C (stdint.h macros) and not a compiler extension.\n- The macro mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0) is a standard preprocessor macro, not an extension.\n- The comment style (/**< ... */) is just a comment, not an extension.\n- No inline assembly, pragmas, nonstandard suffixes, or other vendor-specific constructs appear.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
