  "explanation": "To decide whether MHD_uint64_to_str should take a pointer to const (or whether callers incorrectly pass const memory), the analyzer must see how the buffer parameter is declared and used at call sites. Specifically:\n\n- MHD_uint64_to_str (prototype): confirm the current signature and any existing const qualification on the parameter in headers. If the prototype already uses const, that is directly relevant.\n\n- build_header_response (definition): this is the only direct caller of MHD_uint64_to_str in the provided call graph. You must inspect its call-site to see what expression/variable is passed as 'buf' and whether build_header_response expects or provides a mutable buffer.\n\n- The buffer variable(s) in build_header_response (declarations/allocation): knowing whether the passed object is a local char array, a heap allocation, or a pointer into some shared/const storage determines whether the buffer is actually mutable. This is the primary evidence for whether 'buf' can/should be const-qualified.\n\n- buffer_append and connection_maximize_write_buffer (and their related buffer/connection types): build_header_response calls these functions; they may create/return or provide access to the memory passed to MHD_uint64_to_str. Their prototypes/definitions reveal whether the returned pointers are to mutable memory or to const-qualified storage.\n\n- struct/typedefs for response/write buffers (e.g., MHD_Response, MHD_Connection): if the buffer passed is a struct member (or obtained through a connection/response API), the field/type declarations show whether the underlying storage is const-qualified; this affects whether MHD_uint64_to_str could reasonably accept a const char *.\n\n- transmit_error_response_len and MHD_connection_handle_idle (callers of build_header_response): to be thorough you must confirm build_header_response is never called from elsewhere with a different buffer provenance that could be const. That ensures there are no other contexts forcing or forbidding const qualification.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine (a) whether MHD_uint64_to_str actually writes to the buffer (it does in its body), and (b) whether any caller ever passes pointers to const memory \u2014 if callers only pass mutable buffers, the pointer cannot be const; if any caller passes const data (or APIs provide const pointers), the function signature would violate const-correctness and should be changed or usage corrected."
