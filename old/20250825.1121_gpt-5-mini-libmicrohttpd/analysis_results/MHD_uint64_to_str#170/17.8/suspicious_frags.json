  "explanation": "The MISRA rule targets modifications of function parameters. The above fragments show direct modifications to parameters (buf_size and val) and therefore should be investigated. Other code in the function does not modify parameters: assignments to *chr modify the object pointed to by the pointer parameter (allowed by the rule), chr is a local pointer variable and may be incremented, divisor and digit are local variables modified freely, mhd_assert is defined as a no-op and contains no parameter modification, and there are no assignments to the pointer parameter buf itself. Hence those other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.8."
