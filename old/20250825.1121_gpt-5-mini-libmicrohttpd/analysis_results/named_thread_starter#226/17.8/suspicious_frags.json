  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the pointer parameter 'data' itself. The function only: (1) tests 'data' for NULL, (2) creates a local pointer 'param' initialized from 'data' (struct MHD_named_helper_param_ *const param = (struct ...) data; \u2014 this does not change 'data'), (3) reads members via 'param' (param->arg, param->start_routine, param->name), (4) calls free(data) which deallocates the object referred to by the pointer (the rule permits modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter), and (5) calls the start routine with the saved argument. There are no assignments to the parameter variable 'data' (no statements like data = ...), so the pointer itself is not modified. Therefore, under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 this function does not present a violation and no fragments require further investigation."
