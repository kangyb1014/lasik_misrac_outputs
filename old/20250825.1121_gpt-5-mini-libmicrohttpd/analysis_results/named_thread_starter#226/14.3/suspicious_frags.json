  "explanation": "No suspicious controlling expressions found. The only conditional is\n  if (NULL == data)\nwhich tests the incoming parameter and is not an invariant (it depends on the function argument). There are no loops (for, while, do-while) or other controlling expressions that evaluate to a constant/invariant value. Other statements (casts, function calls, free, return via function pointer) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Consequently, there are no code fragments here that warrant investigation for invariant controlling expressions."
