  "explanation": "- struct MHD_named_helper_param_: The function dereferences param->name, param->arg and param->start_routine. The struct definition is needed to confirm those members exist, their types and any attributes (e.g. qualifiers, annotations) that could affect whether the code that follows the NULL check is actually reachable.\n- MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_: This typedef/function-pointer type describes the signature and attributes of start_routine (e.g. parameter types and attributes such as noreturn). If the start routine type is declared with noreturn or other attributes that affect control flow, the reachability of the return statement (and code after the call) can change.\n- MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_: The return type of the thread routine (and of named_thread_starter). The exact type (including if it is void) affects whether the statement return thr_func(arg); is well-formed and whether any following code would be reachable.\n- MHD_THRD_CALL_SPEC_: Calling-convention / attribute macro applied to the function. This macro may expand to attributes (e.g. noreturn or compiler-specific annotations) that affect whether the function can return and therefore whether subsequent code is reachable.\n- MHD_set_cur_thread_name_: The callee invoked before using param. If this function is declared with attributes that do not return (noreturn), longjmp/exit behavior, or side effects that alter control flow, that could make subsequent code unreachable; its prototype/attributes are needed to determine that.\n- free: The standard free prototype is normally trivial, but if project provides a replacement or wrapper with non-standard attributes (noreturn/longjmp/abort), that could affect reachability. Include free to confirm it does not alter control flow.\n\nThese symbols supply the type and attribute information that a static analysis needs to determine whether any statements in named_thread_starter can never be reached (MISRA: no unreachable code)."
