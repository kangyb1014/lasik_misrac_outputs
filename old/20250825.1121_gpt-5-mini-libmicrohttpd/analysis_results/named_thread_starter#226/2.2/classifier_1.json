  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of named_thread_starter:\n```c\nstatic MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_ MHD_THRD_CALL_SPEC_\nnamed_thread_starter (void *data)\n{\n  struct MHD_named_helper_param_ *const param =\n    (struct MHD_named_helper_param_ *) data;\n  void *arg;\n  MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_ thr_func;\n\n  if (NULL == data)\n    return (MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_) 0;\n\n  MHD_set_cur_thread_name_ (param->name);\n\n  arg = param->arg;\n  thr_func = param->start_routine;\n  free (data);\n\n  return thr_func (arg);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function named_thread_starter:\nconst char *value\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn thr_func (arg);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
