  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were judged not to require investigation for Rule 2.2: the NULL-check and immediate return (if (NULL == data) return (MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_) 0;) is an explicit guard against dereferencing a NULL pointer and removing it would change program behaviour. The local declarations (void *arg; and MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_ thr_func;) are used later in the function and thus are not dead. The cast in the return of the NULL case returns the appropriate thread return type and cannot be removed without changing behaviour. The listed fragments were chosen because they are operations whose removal or relocation (for example the early assignment of param before the NULL check, the thread-name-setting call, the extraction of fields from param, freeing of data and the subsequent invocation of the saved function pointer) deserve inspection to ensure none are executed unnecessarily or could be safely removed without affecting program behaviour. Other code in the function is clearly required for correct operation and therefore was not included."
