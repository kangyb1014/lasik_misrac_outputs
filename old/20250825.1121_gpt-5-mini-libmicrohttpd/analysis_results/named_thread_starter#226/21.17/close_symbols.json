  "explanation": "- struct MHD_named_helper_param_ (definition): needed to know the exact type and ownership of param->name (is it char * or char[] inside the struct?), and types of param->arg and param->start_routine. If name is an inline array versus a pointer to externally owned memory changes whether passing it to the thread-name routine or freeing the struct can create out\u2011of\u2011bounds access by string functions.\n\n- MHD_set_cur_thread_name_ (implementation / prototype): named_thread_starter calls this with param->name. To decide MISRA string-function safety we must see whether that function copies the string or stores the pointer, and whether it uses any string.h functions (strcpy/strncpy/strlen/memcpy etc.) \u2014 and if so whether it supplies correct lengths / bounds. If it stores the pointer for later use, that can lead to later out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses after free(data).\n\n- function(s) that allocate and populate the MHD_named_helper_param_ instance (the creator that builds/passes `data`): needed to determine the lifetime and origin of the name buffer (e.g. allocated, duplicated, or pointing at a temporary stack buffer). If the creator passes a pointer to a short-lived buffer (stack or transient) then any string.h usage later may access memory beyond its bounds; conversely if the creator allocates or duplicates the name, that affects whether the free(data) here invalidates the name.\n\n- typedef/definition of MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_ (start_routine signature): to confirm what thr_func expects for its arg and whether any interaction with the name/arg lifetimes could cause string functions to be invoked on invalid memory. Also useful to know whether thr_func is expected to run concurrently and whether it could access memory referenced by param if that memory was not copied out safely.\n\n(These symbols together let an analyst determine whether any string.h calls reachable from named_thread_starter or its callees operate on buffers whose bounds or lifetimes may have been violated.)"
