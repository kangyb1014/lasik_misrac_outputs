  "explanation": "The remaining lines in the function are simple declarations, a null check and a cast/assignment that do not themselves invoke any string-handling functions from <string.h>. Specifically, the function signature and local variable declarations, the initial cast/assignment of data to param, the NULL check and the early return, and the typed cast in the return (MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_) 0; do not perform string operations and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.17. The only places that could lead to out-of-bounds string accesses are calls that pass character/string pointers or hand off pointers to other routines (which are listed above). No other lines in the snippet call or manipulate string.h functions."
