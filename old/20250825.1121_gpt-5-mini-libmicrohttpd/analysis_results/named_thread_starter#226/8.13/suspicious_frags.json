  "explanation": "The fragments selected include every pointer-related use in this function that could plausibly require investigation for Rule 8.13 (pointer-to-const qualification): the function parameter, the cast to a struct pointer, the local void* variable and its assignment from a struct member, the access to param->name, the assignment of the start routine, and the free of the passed-in pointer. Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for this rule: the NULL-check and early return are control-flow checks (not about pointer qualification), the use of MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_ casts and the final call/return of thr_func(arg) are related to thread-return/function-call mechanics rather than the const-qualification of pointer types, and the declaration of the function-pointer variable type (MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_) is a function-pointer type where const qualification of the pointed-to function type is not applicable. Therefore those non-pointer-qualification items were not included for investigation."
