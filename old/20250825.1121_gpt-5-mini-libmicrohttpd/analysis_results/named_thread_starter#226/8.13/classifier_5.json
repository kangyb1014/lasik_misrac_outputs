  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'arg' is declared as void * because it is assigned from param->arg and then passed to thr_func which expects a non-const void *. Making it const would be incompatible with the function pointer and the assigned member. A violation would only occur if the pointee is never modified and both the source and the function expected const-qualified type (e.g. const void *), in which case 'arg' should be declared const void *."
