  "scenario": "The fragment 'MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_ start_routine;' is only a declaration of a function\u2011pointer variable and does not call any function. Therefore the rule is not violated by this line alone. A concrete violation scenario would be: if the function pointer were assigned to point to named_thread_starter (e.g. start_routine = named_thread_starter) and then invoked (start_routine(arg)), named_thread_starter would indirectly call itself, which would violate Rule 17.2."
