  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required for analyzing recursion (MISRA rule \"no direct or indirect self-calls\"):\n\n- MHD_set_cur_thread_name_: named_thread_starter calls this function before invoking thr_func. To prove there is no indirect recursion you must inspect MHD_set_cur_thread_name_ to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call named_thread_starter.\n\n- struct MHD_named_helper_param_: the analysis needs the definition to confirm the exact field names/types (name, arg, start_routine) and to follow how start_routine is supplied. Knowing the struct layout allows static data-flow/resolution of what thr_func can be.\n\n- MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_: the typedef/signature of the thread-start function pointer is needed to identify which functions are valid targets, and to match function pointer values to concrete functions in the codebase when checking for possible recursive targets.\n\n- All functions that allocate/initialize instances of struct MHD_named_helper_param_ (i.e. any functions that set the start_routine field): named_thread_starter invokes the function pointer taken from param->start_routine. To determine whether calling thr_func can lead back to named_thread_starter (indirect recursion), you must examine every place that assigns start_routine to see which concrete functions may be invoked. Each such initializer/creator function (their symbol names) is required so the analyzer can expand the call graph from thr_func and check for any path returning to named_thread_starter.\n\nCollecting and inspecting these symbols lets the next agent determine whether any call chain starting at named_thread_starter can eventually call named_thread_starter again (directly or indirectly)."
