  "explanation": "- MHD_set_thread_name_/MHD_set_cur_thread_name_: The target calls this helper. The MISRA rule violation would most likely occur inside that callee (if it uses memcmp on strings). You must inspect the callee implementation to see whether it calls memcmp and how it compares the name argument.\n- memcmp: The actual Standard Library function under the MISRA restriction. You need its usages (call sites and argument expressions) to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings rather than raw buffers.\n- struct MHD_named_helper_param_ (definition): The field type of param->name (e.g. char *, char[], const char *, fixed-size buffer) determines whether the value passed to the callee is a null-terminated C string. Knowing the type and any invariants encoded in the struct is required to decide if a memcmp call would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n- code that allocates/initialises instances of struct MHD_named_helper_param_ (the thread-creation site that sets param->name): Even with the struct definition, you must see how name is populated (e.g. pointer to a NUL-terminated literal, strncpy into a fixed buffer, binary data pointer). That initialization context is needed to conclude whether memcmp (if present in the callee) is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst find any memcmp calls reachable from named_thread_starter, inspect the memcmp argument expressions, and determine whether those arguments are null-terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
