  "explanation": "No calls to the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code fragment or related definitions. The only string operation in add_session_cookie is snprintf, which is from <stdio.h>, not <string.h>, and it is invoked with an explicit destination size (sizeof(cstr)), preventing writes beyond cstr. Given the provided definitions (COOKIE_NAME == \"session\" length 7, session->sid is char[33] allowing up to 32 characters plus NUL), the formatted result cannot exceed cstr[256] and so will not cause a buffer overrun in this function. Therefore there are no code fragments here that fall under Rule 21.17 and need further investigation. (Note: if session->sid were not NUL-terminated due to other code, a %s conversion would read past its bounds, but that is a potential issue with printf-family usage and/or how sid is produced elsewhere \u2014 it is not a use of the <string.h> functions named in Rule 21.17 and thus outside this rule's direct scope.)"
