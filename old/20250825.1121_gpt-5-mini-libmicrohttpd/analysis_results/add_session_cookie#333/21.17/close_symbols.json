  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule about out-of-bounds accesses by string functions you must know anything that supplies or consumes C strings and any functions that might call string.h routines on them: \n\n- COOKIE_NAME: the literal/definition determines its length and whether it is a valid null-terminated string. The snprintf call reads COOKIE_NAME, so its bounds matter.\n\n- struct Session: the layout of the Session object is needed to determine the storage and lifetime semantics for sid (e.g. is sid an array embedded in Session or a pointer?), which affects whether reads from sid can run out-of-bounds.\n\n- session->sid (type/size/constraints): concrete type/size and any invariants (null-termination guarantee) are required because snprintf reads from sid; if sid is not a properly terminated string or points to a buffer smaller than assumed, reads (or subsequent string functions) could access beyond bounds.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: to determine how response headers are stored (copied vs referenced) and whether passing cstr (local buffer) can cause later code to read/write beyond its lifetime. While not directly in <string.h>, later code may call string functions on the stored header value.\n\n- MHD_add_response_header (declaration + implementation + documentation of ownership/copying semantics): this is the direct callee that receives cstr. You must inspect its implementation or documentation to see whether it copies the header string (safe) or stores the pointer (unsafe after add_session_cookie returns), and whether it uses any string.h functions (strcpy/strlen/strncpy/etc.) that could read/write out-of-bounds on the supplied pointer.\n\n- add_response_entry (implementation): shown as a callee of MHD_add_response_header and likely involved in storing header name/value. It is a likely place where string.h functions may be used to copy header strings; its implementation must be checked for use of strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strlen/etc. and for correct bounds.\n\n- add_response_header_connection (implementation): another callee in the MHD_add_response_header chain that may operate on header strings; include it because it may invoke string operations affecting the passed cstr.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_ (implementation): a string comparison helper called from MHD_add_response_header; its implementation may use string.h functions (e.g. strcasecmp/strcasecmp wrapper or manual logic) and could perform out-of-bounds reads if inputs are not proper null-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_get_response_element_n_ (implementation): appears in the callee list and may perform string/array operations when handling response headers; include to inspect any string.h usage.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_SET_COOKIE: the header-name constant passed to MHD_add_response_header; its form (macro/const char*) determines whether it is a valid null-terminated string and its length (used if MHD copies or concatenates header components).\n\n- MHD_NO: the return constant used to check failure; including its definition helps understand return semantics and whether any error paths might expose different string handling behavior in MHD_add_response_header.\n\nRationale summary: add_session_cookie itself only calls snprintf (which bounds-guards its output) and MHD_add_response_header. To ensure there are no accesses beyond object bounds performed by string.h functions, you must inspect the origin and properties of the input strings (COOKIE_NAME and session->sid) and the full implementation chain in MHD_add_response_header (and its callees) because those functions are where standard string.h routines are likely used to copy/compare/store the header value. Without these symbols you cannot determine whether any strcpy/strlen/etc. calls operate on appropriately sized, null-terminated buffers."
