  "explanation": "No function parameter is being modified in this function. The parameters are: 'struct Session *session' and 'struct MHD_Response *response'. The code only dereferences session to read session->sid and passes response to MHD_add_response_header; neither parameter variable is reassigned or modified. Writing occurs only into the local buffer 'cstr' via snprintf. Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter (e.g., MHD_add_response_header may modify *response) is permitted by Rule 17.8; modifying the pointer parameter itself (reassigning 'session' or 'response') would be a violation, and no such reassignments occur. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 17.8."
