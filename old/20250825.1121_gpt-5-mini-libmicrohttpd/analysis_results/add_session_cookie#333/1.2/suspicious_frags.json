  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler- or language-specific extensions in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard ISO C constructs: a static function, standard struct pointers, a fixed-size char array, snprintf, sizeof, an equality comparison, a call to a library function (MHD_add_response_header) and fprintf. There are no GNU or other vendor extensions present (no __attribute__, no asm, no typeof, no statement-expressions, no nested functions, no zero-length or flexible array misuse, no anonymous structs/unions in an extension-only way, no extended inline assembly, and no compiler-specific keywords). Macros and identifiers beginning with MHD_ are library-specific symbols, not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2 in this code."
