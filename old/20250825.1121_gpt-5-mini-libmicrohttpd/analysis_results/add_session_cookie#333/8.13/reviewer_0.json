Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible (e.g. const char *sid), so declaring sid as char * is a violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not provably correct from the snippet alone. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is about pointer declarations \u2014 a pointer should be to a const-qualified type when it is never used to modify the pointee. The shown add_session_cookie function only reads session->sid (passes it to snprintf for formatting), so using a const char * would be appropriate if sid is never modified elsewhere. However the code fragment does not show the declaration of struct Session::sid, nor whether sid is modified at other places. Therefore you cannot conclude a definite Rule 8.13 violation solely from this call. \n\nIf, in the actual program, sid is declared as char * and it is never used to modify the pointed string, then that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to const char *. If sid is legitimately mutable elsewhere, then char * is appropriate and there is no violation."
