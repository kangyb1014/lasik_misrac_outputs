  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible):\n- The local array declaration \"char cstr[256];\" is an object array, not a pointer declaration, so it is not directly relevant to Rule 8.13.\n- The fprintf(stderr, ...) usage involves the standard stream object and a non-pointer string literal; it does not introduce pointer declarations that should be const-qualified in this function.\n- Other tokens such as format strings and numeric literals are not pointer declarations and thus outside the scope of Rule 8.13.\n\nThe selected fragments focus on places where pointer types are present or pointers are passed (function parameters and calls using character pointer arguments) and therefore merit inspection for appropriate const qualification."
