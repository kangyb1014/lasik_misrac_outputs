  "explanation": "No unreachable code constructs are present in the shown function. Specifically:\n- There are no early return statements, goto labels, infinite loops, or conditional compilation directives (#if 0 / #ifdef false) that would render subsequent statements unreachable.\n- All statements are in a straight-line flow: buffer allocation, snprintf call, then a conditional call to MHD_add_response_header and an error-reporting fprintf in the true branch. The conditional depends on a runtime return value (MHD_add_response_header), so its body is potentially reachable at runtime.\n- The function is declared static (file scope), which does not by itself make the code unreachable; it only limits linkage, not execution reachability.\n- No dead code patterns (e.g., constant-false if, unreachable labels) are present in the provided fragment.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If additional code outside this function (macros, build-time constants, or callers) is available, it could be reviewed separately, but within this fragment no unreachable code exists."
