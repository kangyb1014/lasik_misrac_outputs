  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions. To be conservative, I have reported every control statement (all if conditions) present in the function so they can be checked for invariance (including the nested conditionals). Other parts of the function do not need investigation under Rule 14.3: variable declarations (const uint64_t timeout, now, since_actv, jump_back) and arithmetic/assignments are not controlling expressions; return statements are not control expressions; comments and logging calls (inside #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES) are not controlling expressions; there are no loops or switch statements in this function (so the rule's loop-related exceptions are not applicable here). Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef) are compile-time directives and not subject to this run-time controlling-expression rule. Therefore only the listed if-condition fragments are relevant to check for potential invariant controlling expressions."
