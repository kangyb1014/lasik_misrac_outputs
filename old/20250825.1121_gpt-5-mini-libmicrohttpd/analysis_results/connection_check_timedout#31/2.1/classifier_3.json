  "scenario": "No inherent violation. The check 'if (0 == timeout) return false;' is a runtime conditional and not unreachable given timeout comes from c->connection_timeout_ms. A Rule 2.1 violation would occur only if timeout is provably never zero (for example, connection_timeout_ms is a compile\u2011time non\u2011zero constant, or is initialized/annotated as non\u2011zero and cannot be modified), in which case the conditional and its return become unreachable code."
