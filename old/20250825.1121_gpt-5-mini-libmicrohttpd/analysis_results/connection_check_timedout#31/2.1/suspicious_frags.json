  "explanation": "I have flagged all code regions where reachability depends on subtle unsigned arithmetic, wrap-around behavior, and early returns \u2014 these are the places that can cause apparently unreachable code paths (or mask them) and therefore should be investigated for MISRA C Rule 2.1. Other lines in the function (simple assignments, the final `return false;`, the preliminary timeout/suspended checks taken together, and the comment) are straightforward control flow or direct returns and do not themselves create unreachable code beyond what is already covered in the flagged fragments. The flagged fragments include the unsigned subtraction (now - last_activity), the comparison against UINT64_MAX/2, the computation of jump_back (last_activity - now), the small-jump branch that returns false, and the surrounding outer branch that returns true \u2014 these are the only areas where reachability is non-trivial and should be examined. No other parts of the function introduce hidden unreachable code paths that require further investigation."
