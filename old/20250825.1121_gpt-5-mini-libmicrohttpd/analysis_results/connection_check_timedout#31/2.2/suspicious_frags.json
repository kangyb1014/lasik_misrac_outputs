  "explanation": "All other statements are part of the essential timeout computation and control flow and therefore are not likely dead: now = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter(); and since_actv = now - c->last_activity; are used in the timeout comparison; the primary timeout check (if (timeout < since_actv) ... return true;) and the final return false are functional decisions that affect observable behaviour. The variable declarations (timeout, now, since_actv) and the main comparison/returns cannot be removed without changing behaviour. The comment and localization wrapper (_) are not executable logic affecting control flow. Conditional compilation around MHD_DLOG is present in the suspicious list above; if HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined those logging calls are simply not compiled, which is a build-time omission rather than dead code in the compiled unit. Therefore the fragments not listed do not appear to be dead code and do not require further investigation under Rule 2.2."
