The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_check_timedout:\n```c\nstatic bool\nconnection_check_timedout (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  const uint64_t timeout = c->connection_timeout_ms;\n  uint64_t now;\n  uint64_t since_actv;\n\n  if (c->suspended)\n    return false;\n  if (0 == timeout)\n    return false;\n  now = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\n  since_actv = now - c->last_activity;\n  /* Keep the next lines in sync with #connection_get_wait() to avoid\n   * undesired side-effects like busy-waiting. */\n  if (timeout < since_actv)\n  {\n    if (UINT64_MAX / 2 < since_actv)\n    {\n      const uint64_t jump_back = c->last_activity - now;\n      /* Very unlikely that it is more than quarter-million years pause.\n       * More likely that system clock jumps back. */\n      if (5000 >= jump_back)\n      {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n        MHD_DLOG (c->daemon,\n                  _ (\"Detected system clock %u milliseconds jump back.\\n\"),\n                  (unsigned int) jump_back);\n#endif\n        return false;\n      }\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n      MHD_DLOG (c->daemon,\n                _ (\"Detected too large system clock %\" PRIu64 \" milliseconds \"\n                   \"jump back.\\n\"),\n                jump_back);\n#endif\n    }\n    return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (UINT64_MAX / 2 < since_actv)\n    {\n      const uint64_t jump_back = c->last_activity - now;\n      /* Very unlikely that it is more than quarter-million years pause.\n       * More likely that system clock jumps back. */\n      if (5000 >= jump_back)\n      {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n        MHD_DLOG (c->daemon,\n                  _ (\"Detected system clock %u milliseconds jump back.\\n\"),\n                  (unsigned int) jump_back);\n#endif\n        return false;\n      }\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n      MHD_DLOG (c->daemon,\n                _ (\"Detected too large system clock %\" PRIu64 \" milliseconds \"\n                   \"jump back.\\n\"),\n                jump_back);\n#endif\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment detects a large 'since_actv' (wrap-around indicating clock jump back), computes jump_back and either returns false for small jumps or logs a large jump. All operations affect control flow or produce diagnostics (the return false and the conditional tests); removing the block would change behaviour. Although logging calls are conditional on HAVE_MESSAGES, that just omits diagnostics when disabled \u2014 it does not make the remaining code dead. Therefore this does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
