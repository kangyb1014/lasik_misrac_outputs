  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions depend on run-time state or function results and therefore are not invariant and need not be investigated for Rule 14.3: \n- if (connection->rq.dauth_tried) return connection->rq.dauth; \u2014 reads a mutable flag in the connection object. It can be true or false depending on prior activity.\n- if (! find_auth_rq_header_ (connection, MHD_AUTHTYPE_DIGEST, &h_auth_value)) \u2014 result depends on runtime parsing of request headers.\n- if (NULL == dauth) \u2014 result depends on the outcome of the allocation at runtime.\n- if (parse_dauth_params (h_auth_value.str, h_auth_value.len, dauth)) \u2014 depends on parsing results at runtime.\nThe two fragments reported are flagged because the assert immediately preceding the > comparison asserts the opposite relation; that makes the subsequent if controlling expression potentially invariant (always false) in builds where the assert semantics hold, so it warrants investigation for Rule 14.3 compliance (redundant or invariant check)."
