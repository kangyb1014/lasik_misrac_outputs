The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- tool_params / tool_params.epoll: the target reads this object; we must see its definition to ensure the read has no hidden side effects (e.g. epoll being a macro that invokes code containing a for loop or modifying objects). Also confirm its type (boolean/integer) and volatility so it cannot be or be treated as a loop counter or be modified implicitly.\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: this function is called by the target. To be certain the target does not violate the MISRA for-loop rule via called-code behavior, we must inspect this function\u2019s body to see if it contains for loops (and whether those loops violate the rule) or has side effects that interact with any loop counters in the caller (even though the caller has no for loop, called functions could be analyzed separately).\n- MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL: the macro/enum used as argument to MHD_is_feature_supported \u2014 its definition must be checked to ensure it is a simple constant and not a macro that expands into code with side effects or loops.\n- MHD_NO: the macro/enum compared against the function\u2019s return value \u2014 need its definition to confirm it is a simple constant and not a macro expanding to code with side effects or loops.\n- fprintf and stderr: standard IO entities used to print an error. Their declarations are needed only to confirm they are not redefined as macros or wrappers in this build that could contain for loops or side effects relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\nIn short: inspect these symbols to ensure no macros or called functions introduce for-loops or unexpected side effects that would bring the MISRA C for-loop requirements into scope for analyzing check_param__epoll. (The target itself contains no for statement.)"
