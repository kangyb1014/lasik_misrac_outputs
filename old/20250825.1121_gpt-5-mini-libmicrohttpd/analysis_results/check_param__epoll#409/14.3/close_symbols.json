  "explanation": "- tool_params: must inspect the global structure/variable to know whether its fields are compile-time constant, const-qualified, or writable. If tool_params is immutable (const or #define) the \"if (! tool_params.epoll)\" test would be invariant.\\n- tool_params.epoll: the exact declaration/type of the epoll field is required (type, const qualifier, initialiser). MISRA forbids invariant controlling expressions unless covered by exceptions; we need to know whether epoll is a mutable runtime-updated flag or a true invariant.\\n- check_apply_params: this caller may initialise or modify tool_params before calling check_param__epoll; inspect its implementation to determine whether tool_params.epoll can be changed prior to the test (i.e. whether the controlling expression can vary at runtime).\\n- check_apply_param__all_cpus, check_apply_param__threads, check_apply_param__thread_per_conn: these parameter-apply helpers (listed in the static call graph as being invoked by check_apply_params) are potential writers of tool_params fields. They must be checked for assignments to tool_params.epoll (or for code-paths that influence it) to decide if the epoll test is invariant.\\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: the implementation/specification is required to determine whether its return value for MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL is constant for a build or can vary at runtime (and whether the function has side effects). If it always returns the same result for the same build (e.g. compiled-out feature), then the controlling expression comparing against MHD_NO may be invariant.\\n- MHD_NO: the macro/enum value used in the comparison is needed to know its value and meaning (is it 0, an enum, etc.). This affects whether the comparison can ever be true or false and whether the expression is effectively constant.\\n- MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL: the feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported must be known (its value/name) to determine whether the feature-query is a compile-time known query (invariant) or could yield different results at runtime.\\n\nIn summary: to decide if either controlling expression in check_param__epoll is an inadmissible invariant under MISRA, you must know whether (a) tool_params.epoll is mutable and where it is written, and (b) whether MHD_is_feature_supported(MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL) can return different values at runtime (or is a build-time constant). The symbols above are the minimal set required to make that determination."
