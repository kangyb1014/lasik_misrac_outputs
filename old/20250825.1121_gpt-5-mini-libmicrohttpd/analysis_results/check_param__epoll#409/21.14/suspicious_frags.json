  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in this code fragment. There are also no other string-comparison calls (e.g., strcmp, strncmp, or uses of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings). The code only performs: a boolean-like check of tool_params.epoll, a comparison of the return value of MHD_is_feature_supported against MHD_NO, and an fprintf with string literals. None of these involve comparing null-terminated strings with memcmp, so there are no code fragments that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
