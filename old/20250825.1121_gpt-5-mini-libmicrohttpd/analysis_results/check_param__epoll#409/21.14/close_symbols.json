  "explanation": "To decide whether check_param__epoll violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analysis must determine whether any memcmp call is executed (directly or indirectly) as part of the code path invoked by check_param__epoll. Explanations:\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported (full definition/implementation): check_param__epoll calls this function and the MISRA violation could occur inside it. We need the implementation to see if it uses memcmp to compare strings (especially null-terminated feature names) or delegates to other functions that do.\n\n- memcmp (standard library occurrences in the codebase): even if memcmp is not in the local function, any occurrence(s) of memcmp in the project must be inspected to see whether they are used to compare null-terminated strings. Provide the declaration and all call sites so the analyzer can verify correct usage.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL (macro/constant definition): this is passed to or referenced by MHD_is_feature_supported. If this macro is a string literal or otherwise a null-terminated string, it matters whether MHD_is_feature_supported compares it using memcmp. The analyzer needs its definition to understand types and semantics of comparisons.\n\n- MHD_NO (macro/enum definition): check_param__epoll compares the return of MHD_is_feature_supported with MHD_NO. Knowing the type and value of MHD_NO helps determine the return type/contract of MHD_is_feature_supported and whether string comparison could be involved in producing that value.\n\n- Any functions or static/helpers called by MHD_is_feature_supported (their definitions): if MHD_is_feature_supported delegates to other functions that might call memcmp, those implementations must be inspected as well to find any memcmp-on-NT-string usage. Provide the full set of its callees/inline helpers so the analysis is complete.\n\n(Note: other symbols used directly in check_param__epoll, such as fprintf, stderr, and tool_params.epoll, do not affect whether memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings and thus are not required for this specific MISRA check.)"
