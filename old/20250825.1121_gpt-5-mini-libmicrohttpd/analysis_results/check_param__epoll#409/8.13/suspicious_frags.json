  "explanation": "No pointer objects or pointer declarations appear in the provided code fragment that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning by code element:\n- Function check_param__epoll: no pointer parameters or local pointer variables are declared.\n- The only pointer-like uses are calls to library functions: fprintf (format parameter is const char *, so the string literal passed is already used as const) and the stderr FILE* stream. stderr is a standard I/O stream (FILE *) and must be non-const because I/O functions modify stream state \u2014 making it const would be incorrect. Thus it is not a candidate for Rule 8.13.\n- The call MHD_is_feature_supported and the macro/constant MHD_NO are used as values; within this translation unit they are used as non-pointer values. If their external declarations involved pointers, that would be outside the provided code and should be checked in their own definitions, not in this function.\n- The provided tool_params definition contains only integer initializers (no pointer members) so there are no pointer fields that could require const qualification.\n\nBecause there are no pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions in the shown code that could be made to point to const-qualified types, there are no fragments in this snippet that should be investigated for Rule 8.13. If you want, I can also review the declarations of MHD_is_feature_supported, MHD_NO, and any related types (e.g., FILE) to be certain no pointer issues reside there."
