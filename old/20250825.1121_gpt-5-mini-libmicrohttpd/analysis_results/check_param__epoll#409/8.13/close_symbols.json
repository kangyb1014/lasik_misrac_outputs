  "explanation": "To check MISRA's 'pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible' for this function you must know the exact types (and const-qualification) of any pointers used or passed here: \n\n- tool_params / tool_params.epoll: The function tests 'tool_params.epoll'. You must know the declaration of tool_params and the type of its epoll member to determine whether epoll is a pointer and whether it should be const-qualified. If epoll is not a pointer, this rule is irrelevant for that member.\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported (declaration/prototype): The call to MHD_is_feature_supported could involve pointer parameters or a pointer return type in other builds/versions. The prototype shows whether any pointer types are involved and whether they are already const-qualified.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL: The macro/enum/value passed to MHD_is_feature_supported \u2014 its type may be an enum, integer, or pointer. Knowing its declaration rules out pointer-related issues or identifies a pointer that might need const.\n\n- MHD_NO: Used in the comparison with MHD_is_feature_supported's result; its type (enum/int/macro) is needed to determine if the comparison involves pointer types.\n\n- fprintf (declaration/prototype): fprintf takes a const char * format parameter; to verify const-qualification of pointer parameters passed here (the string literal and any other pointers) you need the declaration.\n\n- stderr and FILE (type definition / stdio.h): stderr is a pointer (FILE *). Include its declaration/type to determine whether any pointer usage here should be const-qualified (typically FILE * must be modifiable, so const-qualification would be inappropriate).\n\nThese symbols let the analyst determine which identifiers are pointers and whether they are or should be const-qualified (or are correctly declared non-const), so they are the minimal necessary items to assess compliance with the MISRA pointer-const rule for this function."
