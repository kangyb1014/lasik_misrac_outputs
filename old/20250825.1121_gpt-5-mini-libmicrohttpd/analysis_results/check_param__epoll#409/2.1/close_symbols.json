  "explanation": "- tool_params (definition and initialization of its 'epoll' field): the first if tests tool_params.epoll. To decide whether the 'return !0' path (and the fprintf branch) can ever be reached, you must know the type, possible values, and initialization/assignment sites of tool_params.epoll (including any compile-time defaults or constness). If epoll is a compile-time constant or never set true, the branch may be unreachable.\n- MHD_is_feature_supported (declaration and implementation): the second if depends on the return value of this function. If its implementation always returns a value different from MHD_NO (or its return is a compile-time constant), the fprintf branch would be unreachable. You must inspect its code/contract to determine possible return values.\n- MHD_NO (macro/enum value): the comparison uses MHD_NO. You need the actual definition/value to reason whether MHD_is_feature_supported can return that value and whether the comparison is meaningful or optimized away.\n- MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL (macro/enum value): this constant is passed to MHD_is_feature_supported. Its definition may affect conditional compilation or the behavior of MHD_is_feature_supported; include it to determine whether the feature query can ever indicate 'not supported'.\n- check_apply_params (definition): to determine whether the function check_param__epoll itself is reachable (and thus whether it constitutes unreachable code), you must inspect its caller's implementation: whether check_apply_params is invoked unconditionally, and whether it calls check_param__epoll unconditionally or only under conditions that can never hold.\n- main (definition / program entry): to complete reachability reasoning for the function at project level, inspect main to see whether it calls check_apply_params (directly or indirectly) in any build/configuration. If main (or startup code) never leads to check_apply_params, the whole function could be unreachable.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine (a) whether check_param__epoll is ever invoked in the program and (b) whether each branch inside it can ever be executed, which is necessary to assess violations of the MISRA C rule against unreachable code."
