  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Execution paths:\n- If (!tool_params.epoll) the function returns (return !0) \u2014 this is reachable when epoll is not requested.\n- Otherwise the second if evaluates MHD_is_feature_supported at runtime; if it equals MHD_NO the fprintf and the return 0 are reachable.\n- If that condition is false the final return !0 is reachable.\nThere are no statements placed after an unconditional return in the same execution path, no constant (compile-time) conditional expressions that would make a branch dead, and both return ! 0 occurrences are on distinct, complementary execution paths. Because tool_params.epoll and MHD_is_feature_supported are runtime-determined, none of the branches can be determined as unreachable from this code fragment alone. Therefore no code needs further investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the shown function."
