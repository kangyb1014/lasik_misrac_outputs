  "explanation": "- MHD_is_feature_supported: You must inspect the implementation (or prototype and any callees) to see whether it uses any <string.h> functions (memcmp, strlen, strcpy, etc.) or otherwise performs pointer/length operations that could access out-of-bounds memory. The MISRA rule applies to string.h usage in any called routine, not just the target function itself.\\n- MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL: This macro/enum is passed into MHD_is_feature_supported; its definition can change the code path inside MHD_is_feature_supported or indicate the semantic type (e.g. integer/enum) which affects whether any string handling is performed.\\n- MHD_NO: The comparison against MHD_NO depends on its type/definition (macro or enum value). Knowing its definition helps determine the return semantics of MHD_is_feature_supported and whether any conversion/compare might trigger string operations in called code.\\n- tool_params (type/definition, including .epoll field): The target function reads tool_params.epoll. You need the structure/type of tool_params and epoll\u2019s type (e.g. int, enum, pointer) to confirm that the target function itself does not perform any implicit string operations or pass this field into routines that could invoke string.h functions."
