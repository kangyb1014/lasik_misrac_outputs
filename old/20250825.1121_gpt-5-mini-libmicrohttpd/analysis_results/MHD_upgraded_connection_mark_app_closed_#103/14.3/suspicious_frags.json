  "explanation": "No C controlling expressions in the provided function are evidently invariant. Reasons:\n\n- The only preprocessor conditional (#if defined(MHD_USE_THREADS)) is a compile-time directive, not a C controlling expression covered by MISRA C Rule 14.3.\n\n- The mhd_assert invocations are not control statements (they are assertion macros) and do not create controlling expressions that would be checked by Rule 14.3.\n\n- The only actual C control statement is the if statement:\n  if ((MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_ (daemon->itc)) && (! MHD_itc_activate_ (daemon->itc, \"r\")))\n  This expression contains a macro and a function call; there is no evidence here that it is invariant (always true or always false) without further knowledge of the macro/function implementations or build-time configuration. Therefore it should not be flagged as an invariant controlling expression based solely on the shown code.\n\nBecause no controlling expressions in the shown code are provably invariant from the code fragment alone, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 14.3."
