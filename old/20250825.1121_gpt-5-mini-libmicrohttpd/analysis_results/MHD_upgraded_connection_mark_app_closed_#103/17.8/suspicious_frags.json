  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function assigns to the parameter variable 'connection' itself. The only modifications are to objects referred to by that pointer (connection->urh->was_closed = true; connection->resuming = true), which is explicitly permitted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The local pointer 'daemon' is a separate local variable (declared as 'struct MHD_Daemon *const') and is not the function parameter; modifying daemon->resuming alters the pointed-to object, which is allowed. There are no statements like 'connection = ...' or '*connection = ...' that would modify the parameter. The macro/assert and function calls (mhd_assert, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_itc_activate_, etc.) do not show any assignment to the parameter in the provided code; even if they modify the object pointed to by connection, that is permitted by the rule. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
