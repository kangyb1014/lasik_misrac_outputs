  "explanation": "I found no occurrences of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. The snippet only uses standard C constructs: function definition, pointer and const, preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)), macros (mhd_assert, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_DLOG, _), boolean literals (true), structure member access, function calls, and adjacent string literals (the backslash + newline is just a line continuation/formatting). None of the following common compiler-specific extensions appear: __attribute__, __asm / asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, computed-goto labels, or other documented vendor extensions. Note: macros used here (mhd_assert, MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_, MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_DLOG, and _) could themselves expand to code that uses compiler extensions, but those expansions are not present in this fragment. To fully rule out Rule 1.2 violations you would need to inspect the definitions of those macros and any included headers; however, based solely on the shown source, there are no explicit uses of documented compiler language extensions to report."
