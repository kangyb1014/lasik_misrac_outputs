Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For determining whether any part of find_boundary is dead code you must know which branches and side-effects are actually observable at runtime and by callers. Each listed symbol is required for that reasoning:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: the function relies on fields (buffer_pos, buffer_size, state, skip_rn, dash_state) and on the in-memory buffer at &pp[1]. You must see the exact struct layout (flexible array or appended buffer) to determine whether the buffer access is valid and whether assignments to pp->* fields are observable by other code.\n\n- enum PP_State (PP_Error, PP_Init, etc.): the function compares and assigns pp->state. To tell whether branches (pp->state != PP_Init) or assignments (pp->state = PP_Error / next_state) have effect you need the state definitions and how other code reacts to state values.\n\n- RN_Dash: assigned to pp->skip_rn; to know whether that write is observable (non-dead) you need the definition/meaning of RN_Dash and where skip_rn is later used.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: the function returns these. To decide if returning these values (and the code that computes them) is required, you must know how callers use the return value (control flow, side-effects).\n\n- post_process_multipart: the direct caller. You must inspect how it calls find_boundary (arguments passed), how it interprets the return value and modified pp fields, and whether it performs the initialization/updates of pp->buffer_pos, buffer_size and buffer contents. This is essential to decide if any branch in find_boundary is ever taken or if its effects matter.\n\n- MHD_post_process: the higher-level allocator/initializer of the post-processor. Creation and initialization of the pp instance (initial state, buffer allocation/size, initial buffer_pos) determine reachable code paths inside find_boundary; include this to reason about live versus removable code.\n\n- memcmp and memchr: the conditional logic that makes the function take different branches depends on their semantics and results. Knowing their standard behavior is necessary to determine whether the \"boundary matched\" or \"no match / garbage\" branches are possible and therefore whether code in those branches is dead.\n\n- Code paths that initialize/update pp->buffer_pos and pp->buffer_size: these fields control the pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen check and the memchr length. You must locate all writers to these fields (in post_process_multipart or other helpers) to determine which comparisons and subsequent branches in find_boundary can actually occur at runtime.\n\nCollectively, these symbols give the information needed to decide whether any branch or assignment in find_boundary is executed but has no observable effect (dead code) or whether the code is necessary for correct behavior."
