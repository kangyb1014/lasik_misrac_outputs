  "explanation": "struct MHD_PostProcessor: Required to determine which identifiers in the function (pp->buffer_pos, pp->buffer_size, pp->state, pp->dash_state, pp->skip_rn) are fields of the object pointed to by parameter pp. If these are fields, assignments like pp->state = ... modify the pointed-to object (allowed) not the parameter variable itself. enum PP_State: Needed to confirm the type of next_state/next_dash_state and pp->state (ensures assignments are value copies into a field, not some macro or unusual type that could alias or modify a parameter). PP_Error and PP_Init: These enumerator/macro values are assigned to pp->state and compared to it; their definitions confirm they are ordinary enum/constant values and not macros that could perform assignments to the parameter. RN_Dash: Definition of this symbol (likely macro/enum) is required to verify pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash modifies a field of *pp rather than performing some hidden operation on the parameter itself. memcmp and memchr: Their prototypes/definitions establish that these are standard library functions taking pointer arguments as const (they do not modify pointer parameters or the pointer variables passed into them), so calls like memcmp(buf, ...) and memchr(buf, ...) do not count as modifications of the function parameters. MHD_NO and MHD_YES: Return-value macros/constants included to confirm they are simple constant values (not macros that expand to code modifying parameters) so the return statements do not implicitly modify any parameter. Together these symbols let an analyst distinguish modifications of the object pointed-to (permitted) from any actual modification/assignment to the parameter variables pp, boundary, blen, ioffptr, next_state, or next_dash_state (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
