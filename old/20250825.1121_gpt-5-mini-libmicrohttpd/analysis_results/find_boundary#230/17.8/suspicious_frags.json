  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any function parameter variable itself. Specifically:\n- pp is only dereferenced and its members are assigned (e.g. pp->state = PP_Error; pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash; pp->dash_state = next_dash_state;). Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; only assigning to the pointer variable pp (e.g. pp = ..., pp++ ) would violate the rule, and no such assignment occurs.\n- ioffptr is only dereferenced and the pointed-to object is updated ((*ioffptr) += ...). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed; the pointer ioffptr itself is not reassigned.\n- boundary and blen are only read (used in memcmp) and are not assigned to or incremented.\n- next_state and next_dash_state are read-only parameters; next_dash_state is stored into pp->dash_state (modifying the object pointed by pp), but the parameter variable itself is not modified.\n- The expression (char *)&pp[1] computes an address based on pp but does not modify the pp parameter.\n- The commented-out ++(*ioffptr); is inactive and thus not relevant.\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
