  "explanation": "No unreachable code detected in the provided function. All control-flow paths are reachable given different runtime inputs and pp states:\n- The initial if (pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen) can be true (returns MHD_NO) or false (execution continues). Inside it, the nested if (pp->buffer_pos == pp->buffer_size) is also reachable.\n- The subsequent boundary-check if (memcmp ... || memcmp ...) can be true (enter garbage-handling or error branches) or false (successful boundary found). Within the true branch, both the pp->state != PP_Init and the else (pp->state == PP_Init) branches are reachable depending on pp->state.\n- Inside the garbage-handling else, memchr can return NULL, a pointer equal to buf, or a pointer inside buf, so each of the three adjustments to *ioffptr is reachable.\n- The successful-boundary path (updating *ioffptr, setting pp fields, returning MHD_YES) is reachable when the memcmp tests indicate a boundary.\nThe commented-out ++(*ioffptr); is a comment, not code, and therefore not relevant to Rule 2.1. No statements after return, no impossible conditions or invariant contradictions were found, so there are no obvious unreachable code fragments to investigate."
