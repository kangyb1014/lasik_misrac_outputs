  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition and allocation/initialization sites): find_boundary accesses pp->buffer_pos, pp->buffer_size, pp->state, pp->dash_state and writes pp->skip_rn; it also computes char *buf = (char *)&pp[1] relying on the concrete layout/allocation of pp and any trailing buffer. To determine whether branches in find_boundary can be reached (for example the pp->buffer_pos comparisons and the memchr branch) you must know the struct fields, how/when they are initialized and how the buffer area is allocated/populated.\n\n- enum PP_State (all enumerators, including PP_Init and PP_Error): the function tests and assigns pp->state against PP_Init and PP_Error and also stores next_state. To tell whether conditional branches (pp->state != PP_Init, assignments of PP_Error) are reachable you need the full enum and the allowed state transitions elsewhere in the program.\n\n- RN_Dash (definition): the function assigns pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash. To assess whether that assignment is meaningful or whether code paths depending on skip_rn are reachable/used, the value/meaning of RN_Dash (and related RN_* values if any) is required.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO (definitions): find_boundary returns these values to its caller. To reason about reachability (for example whether a return path is taken or whether a caller treats one return as fatal/unreachable), you must know the exact definitions and semantics of these macros/constants.\n\n- post_process_multipart (source or call sites that invoke find_boundary): the static call graph shows post_process_multipart calls find_boundary. To decide if any branch inside find_boundary is actually unreachable in practice you must inspect the caller(s): what arguments (ioffptr, next_state, next_dash_state, boundary, blen, and the pp contents) are passed and which caller-side conditions guarantee or prevent certain branches.\n\n- allocation/creation function(s) for MHD_PostProcessor / buffer layout (how &pp[1] is populated): the expression (char *)&pp[1] assumes a buffer immediately after the pp struct; to determine whether that buffer exists and how much data it contains (impacting pp->buffer_pos and memchr/memcmp behavior) you need the allocation/initialization code that creates the MHD_PostProcessor and its buffer.\n\n- memcmp and memchr prototypes / semantics: the function logic depends on memcmp returning 0 for equality and memchr returning NULL or a pointer. Although standard, having the prototypes/semantics confirmed (or any project-specific wrappers/macros that alter behavior) is necessary to reason precisely about which branches (the big if with memcmp results, the memchr NULL test) are reachable.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions and relevant code sites) will let the next analyst determine whether any conditional or return paths in find_boundary are impossible to reach (i.e. constitute unreachable code) in the context of actual usage."
