  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C \"no language extensions\" usage you must know how the code relies on implementation behaviour beyond standard C. Specifically:\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): The code does char *buf = (char *)&pp[1]; this idiom depends on the actual layout/last member of the struct (flexible-array member, 1-length array, or relying on adjacent allocated storage). The struct definition (including any trailing buffer member name/type) is required to decide whether the code is invoking nonstandard behavior or relying on a compiler extension.\n- enum PP_State (full definition) and PP_Error/PP_Init enumerators: The function reads and writes pp->state and compares against PP_Init/PP_Error. You need the enum declaration to confirm ordinary enum usage and to see whether any nonstandard enum sizes/attributes are applied.\n- pp->buffer_pos and pp->buffer_size field types: Their types and signedness determine whether comparisons/arithmetics (e.g. pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen) are standard-compliant or invoke implementation-defined integer conversions.\n- pp->skip_rn and pp->dash_state types and RN_Dash symbol: The code assigns RN_Dash and next_dash_state; their types and definitions are needed to ensure no nonstandard bitfield/attribute usage or type punning that would be an extension.\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO definitions: These return values may be macros or enums; you must know whether they use compiler-specific constructs.\n- memcmp and memchr declarations (prototypes): To check for use of compiler builtins or nonstandard variants (e.g., builtins or macros that map to compiler extensions), and to ensure correct prototypes (argument/return types) are used per ISO C.\n- size_t typedef: To validate integer promotions and pointer/size arithmetic are standard-conforming.\n- Any compiler-specific attributes/pragmas on MHD_PostProcessor or its fields: Attributes like __attribute__((packed)), alignment pragmas, or MSVC/GCC extensions on the struct or fields would be explicit language extensions; these must be inspected.\n- Allocation/creation pattern for MHD_PostProcessor instances: Whether instances are allocated with extra trailing storage (malloc sizeof(struct)+n) or the struct uses a flexible array member. That usage determines whether &pp[1] is a portable, standard-conforming idiom or relies on implementation-defined behavior.\n\nProviding these symbols/definitions lets the next analyser determine if the &pp[1] idiom, struct layout, enum usage, casts, and any attributes rely on compiler extensions that would violate the MISRA prohibition on language extensions."
