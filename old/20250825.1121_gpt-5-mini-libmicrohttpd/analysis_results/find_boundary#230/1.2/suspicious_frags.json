  "explanation": "I inspected the code for usage of compiler-specific language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin__ identifiers, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler (__asm__), __declspec, zero-length array extensions, label-as-value, or other vendor-specific keywords). None of those appear in the provided function. The cast (char *) &pp[1] and the technique of treating memory immediately after a struct as a byte buffer is a common C idiom (the \u201cstruct hack\u201d / flexible allocation pattern). While it can be fragile or UB in some contexts, it is not a compiler language extension and therefore not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Standard library calls (memcmp, memchr) and standard types (size_t, enum) are used. For Rule 1.2 (prohibiting language extensions) there are no occurrences that require investigation."
