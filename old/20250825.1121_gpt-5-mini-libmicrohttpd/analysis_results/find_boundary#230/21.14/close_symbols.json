  "explanation": "post_process_multipart: caller that passes the boundary and blen arguments into find_boundary. Inspecting this function shows how boundary and blen are computed/derived at the call site (e.g. whether blen is strlen(boundary) or some other length) and whether boundary is known to be a null\u2011terminated C string. process_value_to_boundary: likely producer/normalizer of the boundary value and length. This is the most important place to check whether the boundary buffer is allocated/returned as a null\u2011terminated string (or as a length-delimited buffer) and how blen is set. process_multipart_headers: higher\u2011level parser that may call process_value_to_boundary or otherwise construct the boundary token from header parsing; useful to understand the origin and representation (null-terminated vs length-only) of boundary values used later. MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: a related string/length aware comparison used in the multipart codebase; examining its usage/policies helps infer whether the codebase treats boundaries as length-delimited tokens (and therefore memcmp on blen bytes is intended) or as null-terminated strings (in which case using memcmp would violate the MISRA rule). These symbols are necessary to determine whether the memcmp call in find_boundary is comparing null-terminated strings (MISRA violation) or comparing fixed-length/length\u2011delimited data (acceptable under the rule)."
