  "explanation": "To decide if find_boundary participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect its callers and any functions reachable from those callers that might call back into find_boundary. Reasons: \n- post_process_multipart: direct caller of find_boundary; must be examined to see whether it (or the code paths it invokes) can call find_boundary again (indirect recursion).\n- process_multipart_headers: called by post_process_multipart; could contain calls back into post_process_multipart or find_boundary, creating a recursion cycle.\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: helper called by post_process_multipart; include to rule out any surprising call-backs (even though unlikely, static analysis requires checking).\n- process_value_to_boundary: another callee of post_process_multipart that might call back into post_process_multipart or find_boundary.\n- free_unmarked: callee of post_process_multipart; include to ensure it does not call back into the multipart processing chain.\n- __builtin_unreachable: listed as a callee in the static graph; included for completeness (it is a compiler builtin and cannot induce recursion, but listing it documents the full call neighborhood).\n- MHD_post_process: caller of post_process_multipart; include so the upward call chain can be inspected for cycles that could eventually return to find_boundary.\n\nProvide the source/definitions of these symbols to the next agent so it can trace all call paths and determine whether any path from find_boundary leads back to itself (directly or indirectly)."
