  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\":\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (members buffer_pos, buffer_size, state, skip_rn, dash_state): The function's controlling expressions read pp->buffer_pos, pp->buffer_size and pp->state. To determine whether those expressions can be invariant (always true/false), the analyzer must know how these members are defined and how/where they can be modified (types, ranges, and semantics). skip_rn and dash_state are written by the function; their types/values are needed to understand the assignments but mainly to ensure no hidden constant propagation.\n\n- enum PP_State (definition and enumerators, specifically PP_Error and PP_Init): The code compares and assigns pp->state against PP_Init and sets PP_Error; determining whether the condition pp->state != PP_Init can ever be invariant requires the enum definition and possible values of state (and whether state is set elsewhere to a fixed value).\n\n- RN_Dash (definition / enum value used for pp->skip_rn): The function assigns pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash; to reason about whether that assignment or any related controlling expressions are invariant, the concrete definition/value and type of RN_Dash (and the skip_rn field) is needed.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO (return-value macros/constants): These are return values used throughout the function. Knowing their definitions (distinct constants) is required to see whether any conditional logic simplifies to constant returns and whether that could make a controlling expression effectively invariant.\n\n- post_process_multipart (caller - initialization/updates of MHD_PostProcessor fields): To decide if controlling expressions inside find_boundary are invariant in the program context, we must know how callers construct and initialize the MHD_PostProcessor instance (buffer_pos, buffer_size, state). post_process_multipart is the caller shown in the call graph and likely contains initialization or updates that determine whether the tested fields can be constant.\n\n- memcmp (declaration/semantics): The expression 0 != memcmp(\"--\", buf, 2) is a control test. To decide if it is invariant, the analyzer needs the prototype/semantics of memcmp (return type and meaning), and to reason about whether buf can be guaranteed to always hold certain bytes (which again ties into how pp buffer is prepared).\n\n- memchr (declaration/semantics): The code uses memchr(buf, '-', pp->buffer_pos) and compares the result to NULL and buf. Knowing memchr semantics and how buf and pp->buffer_pos are set is necessary to determine whether these comparisons can be invariant.\n\nIn short: you need the MHD_PostProcessor layout and related enums/constants to know the sources and ranges of values used in the controlling expressions, the caller code (post_process_multipart) to see initialization/update sites that could make those values constant, and the standard memory functions' semantics to know whether their results could be constant in the analyzed context."
