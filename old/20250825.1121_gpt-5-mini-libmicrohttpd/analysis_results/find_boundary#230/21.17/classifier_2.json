  "scenario": "The memcmp call is reached only when pp->buffer_pos >= 2 + blen (the function returns earlier if pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen), so comparing blen bytes from &buf[2] cannot read past the pp buffer. Therefore this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Caveat: the rule would be violated if the caller provides a boundary pointer that is not valid for blen bytes \u2014 that is a caller precondition, not a problem in this fragment.)"
