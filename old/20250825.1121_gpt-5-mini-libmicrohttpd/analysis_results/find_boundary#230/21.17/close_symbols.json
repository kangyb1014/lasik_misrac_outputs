  "explanation": "To determine whether the memcmp and memchr calls in find_boundary can legally access the memory they read (and thus whether the code violates the MISRA rule on string.h functions), an analyzer needs the exact layout and allocation guarantees for the buffer that 'buf' points to and the meaning of the bookkeeping fields used to guard those accesses. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: find_boundary computes char *buf = (char *)&pp[1]; this depends on the struct size and on the allocation pattern (often a struct followed immediately by a byte buffer). The complete struct definition (including any flexible-array member or the convention that a raw buffer follows the struct) is required to know where the buffer begins in memory.\n\n- pp->buffer_pos and pp->buffer_size: The function uses pp->buffer_pos and compares it to 2 + blen to decide whether it is safe to call memcmp/memchr. The semantics (units: bytes), types (size_t or other), and invariants (e.g. buffer_pos <= buffer_size, meaning buffer_pos truly reflects the number of valid bytes present) are required to prove the memcmp/memchr arguments stay within allocated/initialized memory.\n\n- pp->state and enum PP_State (PP_Error, PP_Init): These determine control flow (whether the function skips/computes offsets or returns early). Understanding these values shows which branches can execute and whether the protective check (buffer_pos < 2 + blen) is always enforced before memcmp/memchr.\n\n- pp->skip_rn, RN_Dash and pp->dash_state: While not directly affecting memcmp/memchr bounds, these fields are written and their types/definitions are needed to fully understand side effects and any potential interactions with buffer bookkeeping in other code paths.\n\n- Allocation/initialization code (caller, e.g. post_process_multipart): You must see where pp is allocated and how large the trailing buffer is allocated relative to the struct, and how buffer_pos/buffer_size are initialized/updated. If the caller doesn't actually allocate 2 + blen bytes after the struct, memcmp could read out of bounds even if buffer_pos claims otherwise.\n\n- Provenance of 'boundary' and 'blen': memcmp(&buf[2], boundary, blen) reads blen bytes from both sides; the analyzer must know that 'boundary' points to at least blen bytes and that blen is a correct non-negative size. The origin of these parameters in the caller is necessary to ensure the second operand is valid for blen bytes.\n\n- memcmp and memchr semantics: To apply the MISRA rule you must treat memcmp(ptr, ..., n) and memchr(ptr, val, n) as operations that access up to n bytes starting at ptr. Having the standard prototypes/behavior documented is necessary to map the code's checks (the buffer_pos test) to actual byte accesses.\n\nWith these symbols and definitions the analyzer can show that the check (pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen) ensures the buffer contains at least 2 + blen bytes before memcmp/memchr are invoked and can verify that both operands to memcmp/memchr are valid for the requested lengths; conversely, if allocation or bookkeeping invariants are not satisfied by the caller, the analyzer can detect a potential out-of-bounds access."
