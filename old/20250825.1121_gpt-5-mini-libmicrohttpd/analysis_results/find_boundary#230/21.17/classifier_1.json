  "scenario": "The pointer buf is computed as (char *)&pp[1], i.e. pointing immediately after the MHD_PostProcessor object. Whether the later calls memcmp(buf, ...), memcmp(&buf[2], boundary, blen) and memchr(buf, '-', pp->buffer_pos) are safe depends entirely on how pp was allocated. If pp was allocated with extra trailing storage (for example malloc(sizeof *pp + pp->buffer_size) or the struct is defined with a flexible array member for the buffer), and that trailing storage is at least 2 + blen and pp->buffer_pos bytes long, then the string functions will not access out of bounds. However, if pp was allocated only as sizeof(struct MHD_PostProcessor) (no trailing buffer), or if the trailing storage is smaller than the quantities used (2 + blen or pp->buffer_pos), then the memcmp/memchr calls will read beyond the bounds of the object referenced by buf, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
