  "explanation": "I only flagged locations that directly invoke functions from <string.h> or the buffer pointer used by those calls. The other code in the function does not call any <string.h> string/memory functions and therefore is not relevant to Rule 21.17. The early check if (pp->buffer_pos < 2 + blen) returns before the memcmp calls, and the remaining statements only adjust offsets, update state variables, or perform simple arithmetic and pointer comparisons; none of those invoke standard string handling functions or perform unbounded memory accesses that would be covered by Rule 21.17. Consequently they do not need further investigation under this rule."
