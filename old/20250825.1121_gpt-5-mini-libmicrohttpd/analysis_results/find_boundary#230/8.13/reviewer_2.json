Example fix: change to \"const char *buf = (const char *)&pp[1];\".\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function find_boundary:\nstruct MHD_PostProcessor *pp\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In find_boundary, buf is declared as char * but is only used for read-only operations (passed to memcmp and memchr and only read). Therefore it should be declared as a pointer to const, e.g.:\n\nconst char *buf = (const char *)&pp[1];\n\nThis respects the intent of the rule and is compatible with the library functions (memcmp and memchr take const void * parameters). One caveat: if other code (not shown) relies on writing through buf, then making it const would be inappropriate; but within the shown function the change is correct."
