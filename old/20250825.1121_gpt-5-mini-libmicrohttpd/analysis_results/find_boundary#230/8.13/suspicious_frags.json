  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const-qualified pointers where appropriate or cannot reasonably be const-qualified: - The parameter 'const char *boundary' is already const-qualified. - The parameter 'struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp' and its members are written to (pp->state, pp->skip_rn, pp->dash_state), so pp cannot be const. - The parameter 'size_t *ioffptr' is intentionally mutable (it is incremented in the function) and thus must not be const. - The local 'const char *dash' is already const-qualified. - Other non-pointer uses (integer members, enum assignments, return values) are not relevant to pointer const-qualification. The listed fragments are the locations where a pointer to buffer data is declared or passed to read-only APIs; these should be reviewed to determine whether the pointer type should be const-qualified."
