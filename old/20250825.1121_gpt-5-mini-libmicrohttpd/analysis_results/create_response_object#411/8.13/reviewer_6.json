True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code passes body_dyn (declared as static char *body_dyn) as a read-only response buffer to MHD_create_response_from_buffer with MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT. Because the buffer is used only for reading by the library, body_dyn should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. static const char *body_dyn) so the pointer indicates read-only usage. Using a non-const char * (and casting to void *) in this read-only context violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If, however, body_dyn is intentionally modified elsewhere after this call, then declaring it non-const would be appropriate and no violation would occur.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function create_response_object:\nstatic char *body_dyn = NULL\n...\nstatic size_t body_dyn_size\n...\nstatic const char tiny_body[] = \"Hi!\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should be to a const-qualified type whenever it can be. Agent A\u2019s observation is valid in principle: if body_dyn is never modified after it is populated and is only handed to the library for read-only use, then declaring it as a pointer to const (e.g. static const char *body_dyn) would be the correct, MISRA-preferred form and would avoid casts. However, whether there is an actual MISRA 8.13 violation cannot be determined from the single function alone. The provided snippet shows body_dyn declared as static char *body_dyn = NULL, but does not show whether the program writes into the buffer elsewhere. If the buffer is modified elsewhere (e.g. it is built or re-used by the program), the non-const declaration is appropriate and no 8.13 violation exists. If the buffer is only ever read after being set, then the current non-const declaration is unnecessarily weak and constitutes a breach of 8.13 (and the casts to (void *)/non-const APIs are symptomatic). Recommendation: inspect all uses of body_dyn; if it is not modified after initialization, change its type to const char * and remove the casts (or use an API that takes a const pointer). If it is modified, keep it as char * and no 8.13 violation is present."
