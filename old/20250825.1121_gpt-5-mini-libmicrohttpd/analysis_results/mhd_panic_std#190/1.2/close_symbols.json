  "explanation": "- _MHD_NORETURN: This macro/identifier is the most important symbol \u2014 its definition will show whether the code is using compiler-specific extension syntax (for example __attribute__((noreturn)), __declspec(noreturn), or other non\u2011standard keywords). If it expands to a compiler extension the MISRA rule may be violated.\\n- HAVE_MESSAGES: The conditional compilation macro controls which branch of the function is compiled. You must know its value/definition to know whether the code uses fprintf/_() (and thus whether any macros in that branch bring in extensions).\\n- _: The translation macro _() is commonly a macro wrapper (e.g. gettext) and its definition must be checked to ensure it does not expand to any compiler extensions or use extension syntax.\\n- fprintf: The declaration of fprintf (from the C headers) sometimes carries compiler attributes (e.g. format attributes) implemented with compiler extensions; inspect its declaration if you need to verify whether any extension attributes are pulled into this translation unit.\\n- stderr: The stderr symbol may be a macro or object defined in headers; its definition should be checked in case it is implemented with non\u2011standard constructs.\\n- abort: abort is typically declared with [[noreturn]]/_Noreturn or with compiler-specific attributes; its declaration must be checked to determine whether a language extension (attribute) is used in this translation unit.\\n\nThe above symbols are the minimal set whose definitions determine whether this function (and the headers/macros it uses) relies on compiler/language extensions relevant to the MISRA rule."
