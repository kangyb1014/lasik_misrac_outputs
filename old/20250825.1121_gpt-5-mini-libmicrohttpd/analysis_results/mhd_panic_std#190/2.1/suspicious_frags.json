  "explanation": "The only potentially unreachable source fragment is the #else block guarded by !HAVE_MESSAGES: in the provided project HAVE_MESSAGES is defined as 1, so that #else branch will never be compiled into the build and is effectively dead for this configuration. Other parts of the function need not be investigated for Rule 2.1: the fprintf branch (the #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES branch) is active and reachable; the (void) cls; statement is executed before the diagnostic and is not unreachable; abort() is the intended non-returning call and there are no statements after it in this function that would be unreachable. The function's _Noreturn specifier and the call to abort() are consistent and do not on their own indicate unreachable code within this fragment."
