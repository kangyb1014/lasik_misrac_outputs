  "explanation": "For deciding whether any part of mhd_panic_std is unreachable you must know how conditional compilation and the used functions/attributes behave:\n\n- _MHD_NORETURN: Macro/attribute on the function declaration. Affects static analysis of reachability (marks the function as non\u2011returning). You need its definition to know whether the function is annotated as noreturn for reachability checks.\n\n- HAVE_MESSAGES: Preprocessor feature macro that controls whether the fprintf branch is compiled. Must be known to know which statements exist in the compiled unit and thus whether any compiled statements are unreachable.\n\n- _: Translation macro/function used inside the fprintf format string. Its definition could be a simple identity or a function/macro with side effects or attributes; knowing it ensures the fprintf call is real code (not something that could be folded away) when evaluating reachability.\n\n- fprintf: Standard I/O function used in the conditional branch. Its return behaviour (it returns to the caller) matters for reachability analysis of subsequent statements in that branch.\n\n- stderr: Standard file stream object passed to fprintf. Presence/visibility matters to determine whether the fprintf call is actually valid code in the compiled translation unit.\n\n- abort: Abnormal termination function called unconditionally at the end. abort is specified to terminate the program (non\u2011returning); you must know/confirm this (or any noreturn attribute on it) to determine whether any code following abort would be unreachable.\n\nThese symbols are the only external identifiers the function depends on that can change which statements are present or whether control can return, and thus are required to assess compliance with the \"no unreachable code\" rule for this function."
