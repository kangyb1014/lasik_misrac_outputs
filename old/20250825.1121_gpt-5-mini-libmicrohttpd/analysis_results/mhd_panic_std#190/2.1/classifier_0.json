  "scenario": "The three (void) cast statements are inside a #else branch of #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES. Given HAVE_MESSAGES is defined as 1 in the provided definitions, that #else branch is not compiled into this build; it is not present in the translation unit and therefore not runtime-unreachable code. Furthermore, the #else branch would be compiled in builds where HAVE_MESSAGES is not defined, so the code is not inherently unreachable across the project. No code path within the compiled function is unreachable (the function ends with abort() and is annotated as _Noreturn)."
