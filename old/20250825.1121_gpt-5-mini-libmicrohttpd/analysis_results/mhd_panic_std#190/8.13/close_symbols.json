  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameter 'cls' can/should be const-qualified without violating MISRA (and without breaking the library API), you must know the external ABI and uses of that parameter. Specifically:\n\n- declaration/prototype of mhd_panic_std (public header): changing the parameter to 'const void *' could break an externally visible prototype. The header prototype determines the public API and whether a const qualification is permissible.\n\n- typedef for the panic-callback function pointer (e.g. MHD_PanicCallback): the callback typedef determines the expected parameter types for any function used as a panic handler. If the typedef declares a non-const void * then changing mhd_panic_std's signature would create a type mismatch.\n\n- struct/field or global that stores the panic callback (e.g. daemon/options panic handler field): the storage point (member or global) holds a function pointer of the callback type; you must check its declared type to confirm compatibility with a const-qualified parameter.\n\n- all call-sites that invoke mhd_panic_std (or invoke the stored panic callback) and their prototypes: callers may pass objects whose types (const vs non-const) determine whether the callback parameter can reasonably be const. Also, callers may cast or otherwise rely on non-const signatures; these sites show real-world usage.\n\n- declarations/types of the objects passed as cls at those call-sites: if callers pass pointers to mutable objects that are later modified through that pointer (or expected to be modifiable by callbacks), then making the callback parameter const might be semantically incorrect or cause API incompatibility.\n\n- signature of fprintf (from <stdio.h>): file and reason are passed to fprintf; confirming fprintf expects const char * ensures those parameters already meet the MISRA const-pointer guidance and are not problematic.\n\n- definition/expansion of _ (gettext) if it changes argument types: the translation macro/function could affect the effective type of the format string expression; ensure it does not alter const qualification expectations.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets you determine whether 'cls' can be declared as 'const void *' (satisfying the MISRA rule) without breaking typedefs, stored function-pointer types, or existing call-sites that rely on a non-const parameter."
