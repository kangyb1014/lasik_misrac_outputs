  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library string.h functions are present in this function. The code only calls fprintf and abort, and performs (void) casts to suppress unused-parameter warnings. The conditional compilation branch without HAVE_MESSAGES explicitly avoids any string handling by just casting parameters to void. The macro _(...) (likely for message translation) and the fprintf call do not invoke any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate Rule 21.17 and nothing needs to be investigated under that rule."
