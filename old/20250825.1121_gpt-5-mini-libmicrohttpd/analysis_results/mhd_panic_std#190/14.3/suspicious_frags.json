  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions in iteration/selecting constructs (loops, do/while, etc.). The provided function contains no for, while, or do-while loops and no other controlling expressions that determine iteration or selection. The (void) casts and the abort() and fprintf() calls are not controlling expressions. The conditional compilation via HAVE_MESSAGES only includes or excludes the fprintf block at compile time and does not introduce a controlling expression. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
