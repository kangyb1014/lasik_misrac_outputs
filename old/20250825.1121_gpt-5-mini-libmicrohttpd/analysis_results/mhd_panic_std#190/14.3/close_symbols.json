  "explanation": "To decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule on invariant controlling expressions we must inspect any macro expansions and included code that could introduce C-level controlling expressions (for example macros that expand to do { ... } while(0) or other loops/conditionals). The listed symbols are required for that inspection:\n\n- _MHD_NORETURN: This is a macro/attribute applied to the function. Although usually an attribute, it could be defined as a macro that expands to code containing control constructs; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not introduce any invariant controlling expression.\n\n- HAVE_MESSAGES: This preprocessor symbol controls which branch of the source is compiled. The presence/absence of the branch changes the C code that needs to be analyzed (fprintf/_(...) versus only void casts); the compiled branch must be known to determine whether any invariant controlling expressions exist.\n\n- fprintf: Typically a library function but sometimes a macro (or macro-wrapped function) in headers. If fprintf is a macro it could expand to compound statements or control-flow constructs; its definition must be checked for any invariant controlling expressions.\n\n- _: Commonly a macro/function used for message translation (gettext). Its definition could expand to code (macro) that contains control constructs; inspect it to rule out invariant controlling expressions.\n\n- stderr: Often a macro (or expression) rather than a plain identifier. Its definition must be checked in case it expands to code that introduces control-flow with invariant conditions.\n\n- abort: Usually a library function or builtin, but sometimes a macro wrapper. Because abort is the final action in the function, its definition needs inspection to ensure it does not hide an invariant controlling expression (for example via a macro that expands to a loop or other control structure).\n\nNote: The local parameters (cls, file, line, reason) are ordinary variables and do not need additional symbol resolution. The key risk for this MISRA check is any macros or preprocessor-driven inclusion that could introduce invariant controlling expressions via macro expansion; the symbols above are exactly those whose definitions must be inspected."
