  "explanation": "- fprintf: need the signature (int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)) to confirm that the format and subsequent arguments are passed by value (variadic copy) and that calling fprintf cannot modify the caller's parameter variables (only the pointed-to objects could be modified by callees). This establishes that passing file and reason to fprintf does not violate the rule.\n- abort: need the prototype (void abort(void)) and its semantics (noreturn) to confirm it does not modify any of the function parameters before terminating execution.\n- _ (gettext macro/function): the macro/function used to obtain the format string; its prototype/definition is needed to confirm it does not modify any of the function parameters passed to mhd_panic_std.\n- HAVE_MESSAGES (preprocessor macro): controls which branch of the function is compiled. The analysis must know whether the fprintf branch is active (which uses file/line/reason as call arguments) or the alternate branch is active (which contains (void) casts). The compiled path determines whether any parameter could be modified.\n- _MHD_NORETURN (attribute macro): this function attribute/macro could expand to compiler-specific annotations; its definition is needed to ensure it does not expand into code that would reassign parameters or otherwise affect parameter semantics.\n- stderr: the standard FILE * stream passed to fprintf; its declaration (or macro) and type confirm that passing it to fprintf does not involve modifying the function parameters.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any statement or call inside mhd_panic_std can reassign or otherwise modify the formal parameters (the pointer values or the unsigned int). The language built-ins (void, const char *, unsigned int) and the (void) casts themselves are standard and do not modify parameters."
