  "explanation": "- memcmp: The MISRA rule refers specifically to the Standard Library function memcmp. The analyzer must know the memcmp symbol to detect any direct or indirect uses (calls, macro expansions, or wrappers) from this translation unit.\n- _ (the translation macro/function, commonly gettext): The code uses _(\u2026) around the format string when HAVE_MESSAGES is set. _ is a macro or function that can expand to different code; the analyzer must see its definition to ensure it does not expand to or call memcmp (or a wrapper that uses memcmp on null-terminated strings).\n- HAVE_MESSAGES (preprocessor macro): This macro controls whether the code path that uses _ and fprintf is compiled. The analyzer needs its value/definition to know which path is active and therefore whether the translation macro (_) and fprintf path must be inspected for memcmp usage.\n- fprintf: The function calls fprintf with the possibly translated format string and the parameters. The analyzer should inspect any local wrapper or redefinition of fprintf in this build (or verify the standard library implementation if that is in scope) to ensure there is no use of memcmp on null-terminated strings reachable from this call.\n- stderr: The stream object passed to fprintf. Included so the analyzer can resolve any nonstandard definition or wrapper of stderr in this build that might hide a memcmp usage.\n- abort is listed (implicitly required for control-flow completeness): although abort itself is not relevant to the memcmp rule, its presence documents the function\u2019s termination behavior; include it only to allow full resolution of calls in the function (and to rule out any unexpected wrapper that might call memcmp)."
