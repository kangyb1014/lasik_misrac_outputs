  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function mhd_panic_std and found no use of memcmp or any apparent use of memcmp via macros. The code only casts unused parameters to void, calls fprintf (with a translated format string via _()), and calls abort(). There are no string comparisons, no calls to memcmp, and no constructs that compare null-terminated strings using memory-compare operations. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
