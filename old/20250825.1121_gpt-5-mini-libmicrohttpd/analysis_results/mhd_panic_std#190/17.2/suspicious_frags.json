  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function do not contain function-call sites that could produce direct or indirect recursion and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: the parameter list and the function definition itself are declarations, the (void) cls / (void) file / (void) line / (void) reason statements are casts to void to suppress compiler warnings (not calls), the #ifdef / #else / #endif construct is just conditional compilation, and the provided macro definition #define _(String) (String) is a simple textual identity macro (so uses of _(...) expand to a literal, not a function call). Therefore no additional fragments in the provided code can introduce self-calls beyond the two call sites listed above."
