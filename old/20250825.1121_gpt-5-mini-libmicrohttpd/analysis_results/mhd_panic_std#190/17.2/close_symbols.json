  "explanation": "To decide whether mhd_panic_std can (directly or indirectly) call itself you must expand the call graph through every function it invokes and any implementation hooks those functions may invoke: \n- fprintf: mhd_panic_std calls fprintf directly when HAVE_MESSAGES is defined. You must inspect fprintf's call graph to see if it (directly or via helpers) can call back into mhd_panic_std.\n- vfprintf: most fprintf implementations dispatch to vfprintf (or an internal vfprintf-like routine). Include vfprintf so the call-chain from fprintf is covered.\n- _ : the identifier _ is used here for translated message strings. It is often implemented as a macro around gettext or a function wrapper. You must resolve _ to the actual symbol invoked to see if that symbol could call mhd_panic_std.\n- gettext: include gettext because _ commonly expands to gettext; the gettext implementation (or wrapper) must be checked for any indirect calls back to mhd_panic_std.\n- abort: mhd_panic_std calls abort unconditionally. You must inspect abort's call graph to see whether abort (or functions it invokes) might lead back to mhd_panic_std.\n- raise: many libc abort implementations call raise(SIGABRT) internally. Include raise because it can invoke registered signal handlers that might call mhd_panic_std.\n- signal and sigaction: to determine if signal handlers can call mhd_panic_std you must find registrations of handlers (signal/sigaction). Static analysis requires these symbols so you can trace any handler functions that could be invoked by raise/abort and could thereby form an indirect recursion.\n\nNote: stderr is a data symbol used by fprintf but is not a function; it does not affect recursion analysis except as a receiver for fprintf. Also include any additional internal libc helper functions you find when expanding fprintf/abort implementations (e.g., internal I/O routines) in the same way, because any function on those expanded paths must be checked for a path back to mhd_panic_std."
