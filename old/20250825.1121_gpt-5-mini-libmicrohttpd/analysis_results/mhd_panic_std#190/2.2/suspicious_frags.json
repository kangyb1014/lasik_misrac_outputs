  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function need not be investigated for Rule 2.2: the fprintf(...) call and abort() perform observable actions whose removal would change program behaviour, so they are not dead code. The lines in the #else branch ((void) file; (void) line; (void) reason;) are inside the conditional compilation branch that is excluded by the provided project definition (HAVE_MESSAGES is 1), so they are not compiled/executed in this project configuration (per Note 2, unreachable/non\u2011compiled code is not dead code). The _MHD_NORETURN macro is an attribute/annotation (expands to _Noreturn) and is not an executed operation. Therefore only the (void) cls; statement is a candidate for dead code in the shown configuration."
