Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_panic_std:\n```c\n_MHD_NORETURN static void\nmhd_panic_std (void *cls,\n               const char *file,\n               unsigned int line,\n               const char *reason)\n{\n  (void) cls; /* Mute compiler warning. */\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  fprintf (stderr,\n           _ (\"Fatal error in GNU libmicrohttpd %s:%u: %s\\n\"),\n           file,\n           line,\n           reason);\n#else  /* !

  "scenario": "The statement '(void) cls;' is an executed, effect\u2011free operation whose removal would not change program behaviour (it only suppresses an \"unused parameter\" warning). Therefore it is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (With HAVE_MESSAGES==1 the other parameters are used but 'cls' remains unused, so the cast is a no\u2011op.)"
