  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for loops are present in the provided code fragment, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (well\u2011formed for loops) is not applicable. The function mhd_panic_std contains only parameter casts to void, preprocessor conditional blocks, calls to fprintf/abort, and the _MHD_NORETURN specifier; none of these are for statements or contain loop counters, loop control flags, or loop clauses to be checked under Rule 14.2. If any macros used here (_MHD_NORETURN or the HAVE_MESSAGES expansion) were to expand to code that contains for loops, those macro definitions (not present in this snippet) would need to be inspected \u2014 but based on the supplied code alone, there are no suspicious for\u2011loop fragments to report."
