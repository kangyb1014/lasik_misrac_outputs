  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are only read/used; there are no assignments to the parameter variables (no writes to 'daemon' or 'format'). Accessing members of the object pointed to by 'daemon' (daemon->options, daemon->custom_error_log, daemon->custom_error_log_cls) is allowed by the rule because the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified; the rule only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself. The va_list 'va' is a local variable; va_start/va_end operate on that local variable and do not modify the function parameters. Therefore there are no violations of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
