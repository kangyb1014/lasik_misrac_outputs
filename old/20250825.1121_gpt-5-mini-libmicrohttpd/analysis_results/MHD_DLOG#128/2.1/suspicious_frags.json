  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code is present. The only return is conditional (if (0 == (daemon->options & MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG)) return;), so the statements after it (va_start, custom_error_log call, va_end) are reachable when the condition is false. There are no unconditional returns, no code following an unconditional jump, no duplicated or dead branches, and no unreachable labels/gotos in this snippet. Runtime behaviors that could prevent reaching subsequent statements (e.g., daemon == NULL causing undefined behavior, or custom_error_log calling exit/longjmp) are not static unreachable code violations under MISRA Rule 2.1 and therefore do not make any code fragment here statically unreachable. Consequently, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 2.1 in this function."
