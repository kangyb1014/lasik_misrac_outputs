  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameters are already pointer-to-const where appropriate (\"const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon\" and \"const char *format\"), so their pointees are const-qualified. The va_list variable and the use of daemon->options are not pointer-to-object uses that would be subject to Rule 8.13. The va_start/va_end usage and the return type (void) are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. The only place a pointer-to-non-const may be exposed here is the member passed as the first argument to the callback (daemon->custom_error_log_cls) and the callback invocation itself; those are flagged above for investigation because the code does not show whether the pointee type could/should be const-qualified."
