The member should be const-qualified (e.g. const void *custom_error_log_cls) and the callback prototype adjusted to accept a const-qualified pointer when it does not modify the pointed-to data.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "The claim cannot be confirmed from the code shown. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns how pointer types are declared (they should point to const-qualified types when they are only used for reading). The snippet only shows that MHD_DLOG takes a const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon and reads daemon->custom_error_log_cls, but it does not show the declaration of the struct member or the callback prototype. If custom_error_log_cls is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. void *custom_error_log_cls) and that member is never modified anywhere in the program, then Rule 8.13 would indeed suggest it should be declared const (e.g. const void *custom_error_log_cls) and the callback adjusted accordingly. However, if the member is modified elsewhere or the callback legitimately expects a mutable pointer, then making it const would be incorrect. Therefore the report is a possible concern but not provably a MISRA 8.13 violation based on the provided information; you must inspect the member declaration and all uses (and the callback prototype) to determine compliance."
