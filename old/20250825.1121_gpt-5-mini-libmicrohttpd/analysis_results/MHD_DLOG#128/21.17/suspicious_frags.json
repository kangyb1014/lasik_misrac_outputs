  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions that can access beyond object bounds. This translation unit contains no direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strcat, strlen, memset, memcmp, strncpy, strncat, strspn, etc.). The only places that could lead to such string-handling issues are the varargs forwarding and the invocation of the function-pointer custom_error_log with the format string and va_list. Therefore the function signature (varargs), the va_start/va_end pair, and the call that forwards format and va are the only fragments that need investigation to ensure the called/custom_error_log implementation does not perform out-of-bounds accesses. Other lines (for example the options check or direct daemon field accesses) do not invoke any string.h operations and so are not relevant to Rule 21.17."
