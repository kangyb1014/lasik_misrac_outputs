  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp or any other function performing raw memory comparisons are present in the provided code. The snippet only performs a bitwise check on daemon->options, initializes a va_list, and forwards the format string to daemon->custom_error_log. There are no comparisons of null-terminated strings in this code fragment; the format argument is only passed through, not compared here. If memcmp were used to compare null-terminated strings, it would need to appear explicitly in this snippet \u2014 it does not. (Any use of memcmp inside the custom_error_log implementation is outside the provided code and therefore not subject to this review.)"
