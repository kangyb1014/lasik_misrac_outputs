The code fragment that Agent A refers to is inside the #else /* ! MHD_TCP_CORK_NOPUSH */ branch and therefore is not present in any translation unit when MHD_TCP_CORK_NOPUSH is defined (as you show). Code excluded by conditional compilation is not part of the compiled translation units and therefore is not \u201cunreachable code\u201d under Rule 2.1 for that project configuration.
