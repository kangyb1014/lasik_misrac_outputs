  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' we must determine whether each controlling expression in pre_send_setopt can ever be a compile- or run-time invariant. The following symbols are required with reasons:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: need full definition to know types of the fields used in conditions (is_nonip, sk_corked, sk_nodelay) and whether they are constant or volatile, etc.\n- connection->is_nonip: used in the first if((_MHD_YES == connection->is_nonip)) \u2014 must know its type/semantics to decide if that comparison can be invariant.\n- connection->sk_corked: referenced in multiple ifs; must know its type and possible runtime variability (and initial values) to assess whether expressions using it are invariant.\n- connection->sk_nodelay: same reason as sk_corked \u2014 used in many controlling expressions.\n- _MHD_YES, _MHD_ON, _MHD_OFF, _MHD_UNKNOWN: macros/constants used in comparisons with connection fields. Need their values and type to determine if comparisons reduce to constants.\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: prototype and return type (and whether it is a pure/runtime function) \u2014 used inside if(...) tests; must know if the call is evaluable at compile time (it is not) and what return values mean for the controlling expressions.\n- MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_: same rationale as for cork state setter \u2014 its signature/return semantics affect whether the if(...) conditions are runtime-variant.\n- MHD_USE_MSG_MORE, MHD_TCP_CORK_NOPUSH, _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA, _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS, _MHD_NODELAY_SET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS, _MHD_NODELAY_SET_PUSH_DATA: these conditional-compilation macros determine which blocks of code are present. To decide if any controlling expression in the compiled function is invariant you must know which of these macros are defined (they can make some runtime checks absent, or leave only constant expressions).\n\nWith these symbols (types, macros and function prototypes/semantics) the analyzer can determine whether any if/loop controlling expressions in pre_send_setopt are actually invariant (compile-time constants or otherwise always true/false), or if they depend on runtime-varying state and therefore do not violate the MISRA rule."
