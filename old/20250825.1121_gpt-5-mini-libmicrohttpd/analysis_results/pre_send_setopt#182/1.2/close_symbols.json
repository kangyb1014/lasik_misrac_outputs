  "explanation": "You must be able to inspect the definitions of these symbols to decide whether the target function uses any compiler/language extensions (MISRA rule). Rationale for each: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection: its definition reveals use of any non\u2011standard/extension features inside the type (anonymous structs/unions, implementation\u2011specific bitfields, flexible array members or other compiler extensions). Also needed to verify the field types (is_nonip, sk_corked, sk_nodelay) and whether those fields are implemented via extensions.\n\n- _MHD_YES, _MHD_ON, _MHD_OFF, _MHD_UNKNOWN: these macros/constants are compared against connection fields. Their definitions may be non\u2011standard (e.g. macros expanding to expressions using GNU statement expressions, typeof, or attributes). You must inspect them to ensure they are plain integral constants and not language extensions.\n\n- MHD_USE_MSG_MORE, MHD_TCP_CORK_NOPUSH, _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA, _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS, _MHD_NODELAY_SET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS, _MHD_NODELAY_SET_PUSH_DATA: these feature macros control compilation paths via #ifdef. Their definitions (or config headers that define/undefine them) determine which code is actually compiled; some of them may be defined in a way that introduces extensions (e.g. macro definitions that expand to extension tokens), so you must see their definitions and how they are set to know what constructs are present in the final translation unit.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_, MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_: the prototypes/definitions of these functions/macros must be inspected. They might be implemented as macros/wrappers that use compiler extensions (statement expressions, inline asm, GNU attributes, typeof, builtins) or have non\u2011standard attributes in their declarations. If they are macros expanding into expressions/statements, the target function may indirectly use language extensions.\n\n- bool (or <stdbool.h>): the code uses the bool type and true/false. You must confirm whether bool is the standard _Bool/type from stdbool.h or whether the project defines a non\u2011standard typedef or macro that relies on compiler extensions.\n\nIn short, any macro or typedef used in the control flow or type declarations could hide compiler extensions; the listed symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether the compiled code for pre_send_setopt uses language extensions."
