  "explanation": "You must determine whether any of the formal parameters (connection, plain_send, push_data) are assigned to inside pre_send_setopt (which would violate the MISRA rule). The following symbols are required to make that determination:\n\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: this is invoked with the identifier connection. It may be a function or a macro; if it is a macro that performs an assignment to its argument token (e.g. expands to something that assigns to the call-site expression), that could modify the local parameter variable connection. The callee's definition is therefore required.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_nodelay_state_: same reason as above \u2014 needs its definition to rule out a macro that assigns to the connection argument (which would modify the parameter pointer itself).\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition, at least fields is_nonip, sk_corked, sk_nodelay): to confirm those names are actual structure fields (and not macros) and to see their types/definitions. This helps ensure that operations like connection->is_nonip or connection->sk_corked are plain field reads/writes to the pointed object (allowed) and not some macro/function that could rebind the parameter variable.\n\n- MHD_USE_MSG_MORE, MHD_TCP_CORK_NOPUSH, _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA, _MHD_CORK_RESET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS, _MHD_NODELAY_SET_PUSH_DATA_ALWAYS, _MHD_NODELAY_SET_PUSH_DATA: these preprocessor feature macros control which branches of code are compiled. To prove no parameter is assigned in all compiled configurations, you must know which of these are defined (and in particular inspect the alternative code paths they cause to appear), and inspect any macros used in those paths.\n\n- _MHD_YES, _MHD_ON, _MHD_OFF, _MHD_UNKNOWN: these macros/constants are used in comparisons against connection fields. Their definitions are needed to ensure they are simple constants (no unexpected macro expansion with side effects) and to understand the control flow in compiled variants.\n\nCollecting the above definitions lets the next analyser (a) identify whether any call is a macro that assigns to the call-site expression (thus modifying the parameter variable), (b) confirm that accesses to connection->... are field accesses to the pointed object (allowed), and (c) examine all conditional compilation branches so no hidden assignment to a parameter occurs in any configuration."
