  "close_symbols": [],
  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. pre_send_setopt has no callees (its static call graph 'callees' list is empty). A MISRA violation for recursion (direct or indirect) would require a path starting at pre_send_setopt following its callees that eventually returns to pre_send_setopt. Because there are no outgoing calls from pre_send_setopt, no such path can exist. The listed callers (MHD_send_data_, MHD_send_hdr_and_body_, MHD_send_sendfile_, send_iov_nontls) do not affect whether pre_send_setopt calls itself \u2014 they only call pre_send_setopt, not the reverse. Therefore no other symbols need to be examined to conclude there is no direct or indirect self-call."
