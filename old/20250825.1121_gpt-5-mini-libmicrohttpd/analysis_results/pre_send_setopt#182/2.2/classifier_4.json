The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of pre_send_setopt:\n```c\nstatic void\npre_send_setopt (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                 bool plain_send,\n                 bool push_data)\n{\n  /* Try to buffer data if not sending the final piece.\n   * Final piece is indicated by push_data == true. */\n  const bool buffer_data = (! push_data);\n\n  if (_MHD_YES == connection->is_nonip)\n    return;\n  /* The goal is to minimise the total number of additional sys-calls\n   * before and after send().\n   * The following tricky (over-)complicated algorithm typically use zero,\n   * one or two additional sys-calls (depending on OS) for each response. */\n\n  if (buffer_data)\n  {\n    /* Need to buffer data if possible. */\n#ifdef MHD_USE_MSG_MORE\n    if (plain_send)\n      return; /* Data is buffered by send() with MSG_MORE flag.\n               * No need to check or change anything. */\n#else  /* !
