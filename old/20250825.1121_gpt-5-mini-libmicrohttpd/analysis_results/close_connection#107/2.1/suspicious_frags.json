  "explanation": "I selected fragments that can lead to code being never executed in some builds or runtime configurations and therefore warrant investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1. In particular, the early return guarded by MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ can make the remainder of the function unreachable if that condition is effectively always true; conversely the branch body could be unreachable if the condition is always false. The two XDLL_remove branches depend on a runtime equality test that could be constant in some builds, making one branch unreachable. The mutex lock/unlock blocks are conditional on build-time macros and can remove synchronization code paths entirely. The mhd_assert lines are implemented as a no-op macro in the provided definitions; any expressions inside those asserts are therefore not present in the compiled code and should be reviewed to ensure no code was made unreachable or lost as a result.\n\nI did not flag the function signature, the local variable assignment (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = pos->daemon;), the comment lines, or the final assignment to daemon->data_already_pending as suspicious because those pieces are simple, syntactically reachable in at least one execution path, and do not by themselves create unreachable code. Similarly, isolated preprocessor conditionals that only include or exclude bookkeeping lines (but do not introduce unconditional returns) were not flagged unless they bracket code that can make other parts unreachable (as noted above)."
