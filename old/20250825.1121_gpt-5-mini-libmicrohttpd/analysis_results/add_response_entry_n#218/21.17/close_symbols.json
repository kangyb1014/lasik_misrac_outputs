  "explanation": "For verifying MISRA C rule about <string.h> accesses you must ensure that the memchr calls in add_response_entry_n never read beyond the referenced objects. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- add_response_entry: This function is the direct caller of add_response_entry_n. You must inspect its implementation/signature to determine how it constructs/passes the header, header_len, content and content_len arguments (in particular whether it can pass a NULL header/content with a non\u2011zero length, or an incorrect length), since add_response_entry_n does not check header/content pointers for NULL before calling memchr.\n\n- MHD_add_response_header and MHD_add_response_footer: These are callers (via add_response_entry) higher in the call chain. They may provide or compute header/content buffers and lengths based on external input. You need their implementations/prototypes to see how lengths are derived and whether they guarantee pointer validity and correct lengths (so memchr's n parameter does not exceed the actual object size).\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_: This is the callee invoked at the end of add_response_entry_n. Examining it is necessary to understand any postconditions or expectations about header/content and lengths (for example, whether it allows NULL pointers when length==0 or whether callers elsewhere rely on different invariants). It also helps determine whether add_response_entry_n must enforce additional checks to keep later code safe.\n\n- memchr: Although standard, include the memchr prototype/semantics (const void *s, int c, size_t n) to explicitly reason about its requirement that the object pointed to by s contain at least n bytes accessible. The MISRA rule applies to this standard function; you must verify that each memchr invocation in add_response_entry_n is invoked with a pointer and length pair that satisfy memchr's bounds requirements.\n\nTogether, these symbols let the analyst trace where header/content pointers and their lengths originate and whether the memchr calls can ever be invoked with a NULL pointer or with n larger than the accessible object, which would violate the MISRA string\u2011handling rule."
