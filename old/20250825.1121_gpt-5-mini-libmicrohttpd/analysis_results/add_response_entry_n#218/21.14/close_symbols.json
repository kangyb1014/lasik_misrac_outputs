  "explanation": "For assessing the MISRA rule \u201cThe Standard Library function memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings\u201d in the context of add_response_entry_n you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- memchr: The function calls memchr repeatedly. You must know its semantics to confirm add_response_entry_n is only searching for characters within fixed-length buffers (not performing string comparisons) and therefore does not violate the memcmp rule itself.\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule references memcmp. Even though add_response_entry_n does not call memcmp directly, any indirect use of memcmp (for example in downstream/internal functions) could violate the rule. You must inspect memcmp usage in called functions.\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_: add_response_entry_n returns the result of this call. To determine whether the overall operation violates the memcmp rule you must examine this function (and its callees) to see if it uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition): Needed to understand how response data is stored/handled by MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ (e.g., whether it expects C strings vs length-delimited buffers) and whether any path converts the provided header/content into null-terminated strings before a memcmp.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (definition): The kind parameter may affect how MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ treats header/content (e.g., some kinds might require null-terminated strings). You must know its values/semantics to follow conditional code paths that could use memcmp on strings.\n\n- add_response_entry: This wrapper/caller may prepare or transform header/content before calling add_response_entry_n or may call the no_check variant directly elsewhere; include it to inspect alternate call sites and data preparation that could lead to memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_add_response_header and MHD_add_response_footer: These higher-level callers (from the static call graph) show other call paths into add_response_entry; inspect them to see how header/content are supplied and whether any caller produces null-terminated strings that later might be compared with memcmp.\n\n- size_t (typedef): To reason about the meaning of header_len/content_len (length-delimited buffers vs strings) you need the exact type (and any project-specific typedefs) to ensure sizes are interpreted as buffer lengths and not string lengths.\n\n- NULL (macro): The function tests against NULL and the semantics of NULL in this build/environment should be known (standard, but include to be complete) when reasoning about pointer null-termination and pointer checks.\n\nIn short: memchr and the type/length information show that add_response_entry_n itself uses bounded searches (not memcmp), but you must inspect MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ and related callers/definitions (struct and enum) to ensure no use of memcmp on null-terminated strings occurs downstream."
