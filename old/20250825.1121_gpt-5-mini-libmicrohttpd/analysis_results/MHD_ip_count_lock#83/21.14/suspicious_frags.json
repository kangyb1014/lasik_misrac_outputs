  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided function or related macros. The function body contains only mhd_assert (expanded to ((void)0)), a conditional call to MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (a mutex-lock-check macro) and a (void) daemon cast. The provided macro MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ expands to a call to MHD_mutex_lock_ and error handling via MHD_PANIC and does not invoke memcmp. There are no string operations or comparisons in the target code or supplied macro definitions, and no tokens matching \"memcmp\" appear in the provided fragments. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the supplied code."
