  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ is a macro that expands to a call to MHD_mutex_lock_(pmutex) and possibly MHD_PANIC; it is not a function and does not cause any function to call itself. Given the provided definitions there is no direct or indirect function recursion (only if MHD_mutex_lock_ were implemented to call back into MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ or itself would recursion occur, which is not shown)."
