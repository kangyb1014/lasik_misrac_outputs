  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed\n\n1) struct MHD_Daemon (full definition, including member types for master and per_ip_connection_mutex)\n   - The function reads daemon->master and takes the address of daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex. To decide if those operations have observable effects (e.g. volatile qualifiers, accessor side-effects, or unusual types) we need the complete struct and the exact type of per_ip_connection_mutex. That determines whether the member reads/addresses are pure/no-op or have side-effects relevant to the dead-code analysis.\n\n2) mhd_assert (macro or function definition and its build-conditioned behavior)\n   - mhd_assert is executed unconditionally in the function. If it expands to code that can abort, log, or otherwise affect behaviour (and/or is enabled/disabled by build flags such as NDEBUG), its presence means the function is not removable without changing behaviour. To judge whether the assertion statement is dead (removable) we must know its precise expansion and when it is active.\n\n3) MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (declaration/definition and semantics)\n   - When threading macros are defined the function calls MHD_mutex_lock_chk_. Locking a mutex is a side-effect that affects program behaviour (concurrency/timing). Conversely, if this routine is a no-op (macro that compiles away) then the call could be dead. We need the routine's implementation or contract to decide if the call is observable and therefore non-dead.\n\n4) MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS (preprocessor macro definition)\n   - The code path that performs work vs the no-op cast depends on whether this macro is defined. To determine whether the function contains dead operations in a given build, we must know whether this macro is set in that build configuration.\n\n5) MHD_USE_W32_THREADS (preprocessor macro definition)\n   - Same reason as above: this alternate threading macro affects which branch is compiled and thus whether the function performs locking (observable) or only contains a void-cast (likely no-op/dead).\n\n6) MHD_ip_limit_add (declaration/definition and calling context)\n   - This function is a listed caller. To decide if removal of MHD_ip_count_lock would change program behaviour you must know how and when callers invoke it (e.g. frequency, required synchronization). If callers are never used/compiled in certain builds or call the lock only in contexts where it is unnecessary, that affects the dead-code determination.\n\n7) MHD_ip_limit_del (declaration/definition and calling context)\n   - Same as MHD_ip_limit_add: examine callers to determine reachability and whether the lock is required for correctness. The calling context (and whether callers are compiled in a given build) is necessary to decide if MHD_ip_count_lock constitutes dead code.\n\nNote: The above set targets symbols that can make the operations inside MHD_ip_count_lock observable (assertions, mutex locking) or that determine whether those operations are actually compiled/used. With these symbols and build configuration, an analyst can decide whether removing the operations (or the function) would alter program behaviour, i.e., whether they are dead code per MISRA."
