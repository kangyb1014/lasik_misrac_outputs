Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments are structural or configuration-controlled and do not by themselves indicate dead code: the function declaration and surrounding braces are required for syntax; the #if/#else/#endif conditional compilation lines determine which statements are compiled for a given build and therefore cannot be classified as dead without knowledge of build configuration; any calls or accesses outside the listed fragments (e.g. the function signature and parameter) are necessary for linkage/usage and may be used elsewhere, so they should not be flagged here. The selected lines are the only in-function statements that, depending on build/time configuration, could be executed while having no effect on program behaviour and thus warrant further investigation."
