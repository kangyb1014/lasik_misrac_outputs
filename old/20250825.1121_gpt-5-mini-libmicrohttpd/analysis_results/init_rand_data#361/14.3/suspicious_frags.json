  "explanation": "Other control constructs in the function are standard runtime-dependent conditionals or API-result checks and are not invariant. The file-open check (if (-1 == fd)), the negative-read check inside the loop (if (0 > len)) and the Windows CryptoAPI error checks (if (FALSE == b)) all depend on return values from runtime operations and are therefore not invariant by themselves. No do-while with an essentially Boolean constant expression or other constant-loop constructs are present. The only fragment that can produce an invariant controlling expression at runtime is the for-loop above (e.g. if read() returns 0 so the loop increment becomes zero), so no other code fragments require investigation under Rule 14.3."
