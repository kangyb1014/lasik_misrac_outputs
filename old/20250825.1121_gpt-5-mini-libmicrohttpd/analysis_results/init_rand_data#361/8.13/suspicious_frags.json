  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not introduce additional pointer targets that could reasonably be const-qualified and therefore do not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - There are no pointer variables declared in this function (only scalar variables and the static uint8_t rand_data[8] array). - The rand_data buffer is intended to be written (populated with random bytes), so making it const would be incorrect. - The address-of usage (&cc) is passed to an API that initializes/modifies the HCRYPTPROV value, so a const qualifier would be inappropriate. - Calls to close(), return statements, numeric casts and arithmetic (off, len adjustments), and the control flow (if/for/returns) do not involve pointer types that could be made const. - System/library functions used (open, read, Crypt* APIs, fprintf, strerror) have their own prototypes; only the places where pointers/strings/buffers are passed to those APIs are relevant to 8.13 and are included above. Consequently, the listed fragments cover all locations in this function that warrant inspection for potential non-const pointer usage under Rule 8.13; other lines are not applicable."
