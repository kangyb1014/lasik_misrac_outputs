  "explanation": "I scanned the provided init_rand_data function and related symbol definitions for any use of memcmp or any pattern where memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings. No calls to memcmp appear in the code. The function only uses open, read, close, fprintf, strerror and Windows CryptoAPI calls (CryptAcquireContext, CryptGenRandom, CryptReleaseContext), and simple integer/boolean comparisons (fd == -1, 0 > len, FALSE == b, etc.). The rand_data object is a uint8_t[8] buffer (not a null-terminated string) and is passed to read/CryptGenRandom as binary data. There are no string comparisons implemented via memcmp in this code fragment, nor any wrappers that appear to invoke memcmp for string comparison. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
