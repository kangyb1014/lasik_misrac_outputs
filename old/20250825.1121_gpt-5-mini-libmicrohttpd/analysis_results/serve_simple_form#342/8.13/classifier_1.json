  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The non-const pointer is used as an opaque connection handle and is passed to MHD_queue_response (and the function is a callback that must match the library\u2019s prototype), so it may be modified by the library or constrained by the external API. A violation would occur if the function and all callees never modify the pointed-to object and the prototype is not constrained by an external API \u2014 in that case it should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection'."
