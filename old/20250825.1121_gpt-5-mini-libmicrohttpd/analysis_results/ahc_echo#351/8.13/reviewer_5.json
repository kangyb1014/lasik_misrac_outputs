This discards the const qualifier of the buffer and therefore fails to use a const-qualified pointer when possible (the API should accept const void *). Hence Rule 8.13 is violated in this scenario.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function ahc_echo:\nstruct MHD_Response\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 concerns declaring pointers to const when the pointed-to object is not modified (i.e. pointer declarations should use const where possible). In the shown function the string pointers (username, password, realm) are already const-qualified. The alleged issue concerns passing PAGE/DENIED to a library API whose parameter is a non-const pointer, which \u2014 if PAGE/DENIED were const-qualified \u2014 would discard a const qualifier in a call. That would be a qualifier-discarding conversion issue (covered by rules that forbid discarding const qualifiers), not a breach of the requirement to declare pointers as const when possible (8.13). Furthermore, the code shown does not include the definitions of PAGE/DENIED: in C a string literal has the array type char[] (not const), so there may be no qualifier to discard. Therefore the specific claim that this code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is not supported."
