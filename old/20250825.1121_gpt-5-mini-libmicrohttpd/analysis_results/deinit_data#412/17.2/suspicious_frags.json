  "explanation": "Fragments not listed are not suspicious for Rule 17.2 because they do not perform function calls that could directly or indirectly re-enter the same functions. Examples: setting pointers to NULL, resetting num_resps, free(body_dyn), freeing response->data_iov, the loops that free header structures (free(pos->header/value/pos)), the final free(response) in MHD_destroy_response, and the reference_count decrement/early return logic are plain operations or simple library calls that do not contain function-pointer invocations capable of causing recursion. The mutex helper calls (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, MHD_mutex_destroy_chk_) are simple synchronization helpers (no function-pointer callbacks shown) and thus are not flagged here. The only call sites that can create indirect recursion paths (via user-provided callbacks or other code) are the two calls to MHD_destroy_response in deinit_data and the invocation of the response->crfc callback inside MHD_destroy_response, so those fragments are reported for investigation."
