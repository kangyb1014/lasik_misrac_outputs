  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in the provided code with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The rule concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. In the snippets shown there are no pointer declarations to review \u2014 only uses of existing pointers. All pointer uses in deinit_data and in MHD_destroy_response involve destroying or freeing the pointed-to objects or otherwise mutating them: \n\n- resp_single is passed to MHD_destroy_response which decrements reference_count, may call callbacks, frees internal buffers and finally frees the response object itself. Because the function modifies and frees the pointed object, the pointer must not be to a const-qualified type.\n\n- resps is iterated and each resps[i] is passed to MHD_destroy_response for the same reasons; subsequently the resps array itself is freed. Both the elements and the array are being freed/modified and therefore cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- body_dyn is passed to free() and then set to NULL; freeing implies ownership and potential modification (deallocation), so it must not be declared pointing to a const-qualified type.\n\n- Inside MHD_destroy_response, fields such as response->data_iov, pos->header, pos->value and response itself are freed. These are explicitly deallocated, so they cannot be const-qualified.\n\nBecause every pointer usage shown involves mutation or deallocation of the pointed-to object, making their types const would be inappropriate and would require casts to remove constness when freeing/modifying, which would violate the intent of MISRA Rule 8.13 rather than satisfy it. Therefore there are no code fragments here that should be flagged for investigation under Rule 8.13."
