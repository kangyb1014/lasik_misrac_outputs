  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only for-statements are relevant for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The provided target function contains a single for-loop (and the surrounding if-block that governs the loop and subsequent modifications of related objects). Other fragments in the snippet (the null-checks and direct calls to MHD_destroy_response or free for resp_single and body_dyn, the assignments setting pointers to NULL, and the global declarations of resps and num_resps) do not themselves form for-statements and therefore do not need inspection for Rule 14.2. The while-loop inside MHD_destroy_response is not a for-loop and is out of scope for this specific rule assessment, so it is not included as a suspicious fragment for Rule 14.2."
