  "explanation": "I found no explicit uses of compiler language extensions in the deinit_data function or the shown related symbols: all pointer checks against NULL, calls to free(), the for-loop, assignments, and function-pointer invocation use standard C. The conditional compilation using defined(...) is the standard preprocessor, and the mutex/function calls (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_, MHD_mutex_destroy_chk_) and other identifiers shown are normal function or macro names as presented and do not themselves prove use of a compiler language extension.\n\nThe only fragment that could mask a compiler-specific extension is the _MHD_EXTERN macro at the start of the MHD_destroy_response definition: such linkage/visibility macros are commonly defined to expand to compiler-specific attributes (for example GCC __attribute__ or MSVC __declspec), which are language extensions. Its expansion is not shown here, so that macro occurrence should be investigated to determine whether it expands to any compiler-specific extension. No other code lines in the provided snippets contain explicit extension syntax (e.g., __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, or other compiler-specific tokens) and therefore do not require investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the supplied code."
