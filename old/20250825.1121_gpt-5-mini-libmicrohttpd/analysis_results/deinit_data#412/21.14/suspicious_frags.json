  "explanation": "I examined the provided code fragments (deinit_data, MHD_destroy_response, and the related variable declarations). There are no calls to memcmp (nor any apparent string-comparison logic using memcmp) in the shown code. The fragments only perform NULL checks, resource destruction, and free operations; they do not compare null-terminated strings with memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Note: a memcmp use could exist elsewhere or inside callbacks such as response->crfc, but those definitions are not provided here and thus cannot be flagged from the given code.)"
