  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are statically unreachable in the provided code (after preprocessing). Reasoning:\n\n- deinit_data: All statements are either unconditional assignments (e.g. resp_single = NULL, resps = NULL, body_dyn = NULL) or guarded by runtime checks (if (NULL != ...)) or a runtime loop (for (i = 0; i < num_resps; ++i)). None of these constructs is guaranteed to be skipped for all possible program states, so they are not unreachable. The loop body may be skipped at runtime when num_resps == 0, but that is a runtime condition (not a statically unreachable statement).\n\n- MHD_destroy_response (additional code): The function contains early returns (e.g. if (NULL == response) return; and return when reference_count != 0). Those returns are conditional, so the code after them is reachable when the conditions are false. Conditional compilation blocks (#if defined(...)) may remove portions of the source before compilation depending on configuration, but that is a build-time choice \u2014 the remaining compiled code contains no statements that are unconditionally unreachable. There is no code placed after an unconditional return in the same translation unit that would be unreachable in every configuration.\n\n- Static variable initializers (resp_single, resps, num_resps, body_dyn) are normal and not unreachable code.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that should be investigated specifically for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
