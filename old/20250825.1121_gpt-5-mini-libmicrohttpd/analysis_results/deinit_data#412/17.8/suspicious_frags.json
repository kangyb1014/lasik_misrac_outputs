  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasoning: deinit_data has no function parameters, so it cannot violate Rule 17.8 \u2014 it modifies file-scope (static) pointer variables (resp_single, resps, body_dyn) which are not function parameters. The calls to MHD_destroy_response pass pointer values; inside MHD_destroy_response only the object pointed-to is modified (fields like reference_count and first_header are updated, memory freed, etc.), and the pointer parameter variable itself is never reassigned. Therefore there are no occurrences of a function parameter being modified and no code fragments requiring investigation for Rule 17.8."
