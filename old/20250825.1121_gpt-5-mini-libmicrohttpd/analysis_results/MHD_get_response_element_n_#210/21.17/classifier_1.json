  "scenario": "The assertion mhd_assert(0 != key_len) itself does not call or use any <string.h> functions and does not perform any memory accesses, so it does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, this single check does not guarantee the absence of a Rule 21.17 violation elsewhere: if key_len (or pos->header_size) is larger than the actual allocated size of the buffers pointed to by key or pos->header, then a subsequent call (e.g. to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ which may use memcmp/memcpy/strncmp) could read beyond the object bounds and violate Rule 21.17. In short, the fragment is not a violation, but out-of-bounds reads can still occur later if the provided lengths are incorrect."
