  "explanation": "There are no direct calls to the Standard Library string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) inside this function, so no other fragments need investigation for Rule 21.17. The loop, the comparison pos->header_size == key_len and the traversal of response->first_header/pos->next do not themselves invoke string.h operations and are guarded by the size equality test. The call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ is flagged because it is an external/custom routine that may internally call string.h functions and therefore must be inspected to ensure it does not access beyond object bounds. The mhd_assert lines are flagged because they perform pointer/element accesses (notably key[0]) and may be compiled out (e.g. NDEBUG), so they do not reliably enforce preconditions \u2014 this affects safety of any subsequent string handling and thus should be reviewed."
