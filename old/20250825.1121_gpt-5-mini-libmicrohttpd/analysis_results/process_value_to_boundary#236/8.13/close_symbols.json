  "explanation": "To check MISRA C \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" for process_value_to_boundary you must know the precise types and const-qualification of the pointers used and of the callback invoked. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): The function obtains buf by casting &pp[1] and reads/writes members of *pp. You need the exact declarations (and const qualifiers) of all members to decide whether pointers derived from pp (and members that are pointer-typed) should be const. In particular the buffer storage layout and whether the bytes after the struct are modifiable/owned by the implementation affects whether buf should be char * or const char *.\n\n- type/prototype of pp->ikvi (the post-data iterator callback): The code calls pp->ikvi(..., buf, pp->value_offset, newline). Whether buf should be const depends primarily on the ikvi parameter type (does it accept const void*/const char* or a non-const pointer?). You must inspect the callback prototype to determine whether passing a modifiable pointer or a const-qualified pointer is required/allowed.\n\n- declarations of memchr and memcmp (from <string.h>): These standard prototypes show whether the called functions take const-qualified pointers (memcmp takes const void *, memchr takes const void * and returns void *). Knowing these signatures is necessary to check whether current usage performs any implicit/explicit discarding of const qualification or requires casts that violate MISRA rules.\n\n- definitions of the specific MHD_PostProcessor members used: buffer_pos, buffer_size, value_offset, must_ikvi, skip_rn, state, dash_state, cls, content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding: For each pointer-typed member (e.g. content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding, cls) you must know whether they are declared const-qualified, and whether they are passed to ikvi or otherwise used in ways that require const qualification.\n\n(Other symbols in the file like RN_Dash, PP_State values, MHD_YES/MHD_NO, MHD_POSTDATA_KIND are not needed to determine pointer const-correctness of the buffer/callback arguments; they affect control flow but not the const qualifications under scrutiny.)"
