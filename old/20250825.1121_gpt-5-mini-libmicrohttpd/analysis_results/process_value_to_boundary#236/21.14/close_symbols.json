  "explanation": "post_process_multipart: This caller constructs and passes the boundary pointer and blen length into process_value_to_boundary. To decide whether memcmp is being used to compare a null\u2011terminated C string you must inspect how post_process_multipart obtains/initializes the boundary and blen arguments (e.g., whether blen was computed with strlen(...) + 1 or otherwise includes the terminating '\\0').\n\nfind_boundary: The boundary value and its length (blen) are typically produced or validated by find_boundary. Its implementation reveals whether the boundary buffer is a C string (null terminated) and whether blen includes the terminating NUL \u2014 that is the key fact needed to determine if memcmp(&buf[newline + 4], boundary, blen) is comparing a null\u2011terminated string (MISRA violation).\n\nmemcmp: Although a standard library function, include the memcmp call site/usage semantics so the analyzer can confirm how it is invoked (length argument blen and the operand pointers). The rule applies to uses of memcmp that compare null\u2011terminated strings; examining the memcmp call together with the boundary/blen origin (above) is required to decide compliance."
