  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. The code contains only standard C constructs: function with a prototype, pointer arithmetic and casts, standard library calls (memchr, memcmp), enum parameters, and ordinary control flow. There are no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_* or __declspec, nor any vendor-specific keywords or pragmas. The idiom char *buf = (char *)&pp[1]; is a common portable technique to address memory immediately following a struct and is not a compiler extension. Assigning the result of memchr (void*) to a char* is allowed in C. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions used)."
