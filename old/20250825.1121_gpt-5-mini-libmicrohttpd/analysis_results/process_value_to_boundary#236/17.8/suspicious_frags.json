  "explanation": "No function parameter itself is reassigned in this function. All uses that modify state operate on objects pointed to by pointer parameters (which MISRA 2023 Rule 17.8 allows):\n- (*ioffptr) += ... modifies the object referred to by ioffptr, not the pointer ioffptr itself (allowed).\n- pp->... assignments modify members of the object pointed to by pp, not the parameter pp (allowed).\n- buf is a local pointer derived from &pp[1]; modifying *buf (buf[newline] = '\\0') modifies the object pointed to by pp, not the pp parameter itself (allowed).\n- boundary, blen, next_state and next_dash_state are only read (used in memcmp or assigned into pp-> members) and are not reassigned.\nThere are no statements that assign to the parameter identifiers pp, ioffptr, boundary, blen, next_state or next_dash_state themselves, so no code fragments violate Rule 17.8."
