  "explanation": "- struct MHD_PostProcessor: You must see the struct definition (member names and types) to determine whether assignments in the function (pp->skip_rn = ..., pp->state = ..., pp->dash_state = ..., pp->must_ikvi = ..., pp->value_offset += ...) modify the object pointed to by the parameter (which is permitted) vs. modifying the parameter identifier itself (which would violate MISRA). Also needed to confirm buffer_pos/buffer_size types used in pointer/index arithmetic and the meaning of &pp[1].\n- enum PP_State: next_state and next_dash_state are of this type; the enum definition shows they are value parameters (not pointers) so reads (pp->state = next_state) do not modify the parameter variable itself.\n- RN_Dash: required to understand the value assigned to pp->skip_rn and to ensure that this is an assignment to a member of *pp, not to the parameter variable.\n- PP_Error: needed to interpret pp->state = PP_Error and to confirm this is a member write (allowed) and not a reassignment of the parameter.\n- MHD_NO and MHD_YES: return macros/values used by the function; included so the analyzer can interpret return behavior but mainly to confirm returns do not involve reassigning parameters.\n- pp->ikvi (function-pointer type/signature): the code calls pp->ikvi(...). The function-pointer declaration is needed to verify this is a call through a member of *pp (allowed) and not some macro or construct that would reassign or otherwise modify the parameter variable.\n- MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: the argument passed to pp->ikvi; include for completeness to understand the call but primarily to ensure the call expression does not mutate the parameter identifier.\n\nThese symbols let the next agent distinguish between (allowed) modifications of the object pointed to by pointer parameters and (forbidden) direct modifications/reassignments of the parameter identifiers themselves."
