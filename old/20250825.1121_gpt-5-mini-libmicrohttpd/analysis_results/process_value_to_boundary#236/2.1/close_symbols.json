  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_PostProcessor\n   - Required because the function reads and writes many of its fields (buffer_pos, buffer_size, skip_rn, state, dash_state, must_ikvi, ikvi, cls, content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding, value_offset). To decide whether any branch or statement is unreachable you must know the types, possible ranges and semantics of these fields (e.g. are buffer_pos/buffer_size constrained, is ikvi ever NULL, what values skip_rn/state/dash_state can take).\n\n2) enum PP_State (all enumerators, especially PP_Error)\n   - The function assigns pp->state = PP_Error and other state values; to determine whether subsequent code can be reached or whether certain assignments produce impossible/absurd states you need the full enumeration and any invariants about PP_State values.\n\n3) RN_Dash\n   - This symbol is written into pp->skip_rn. To know whether that write can create impossible/unreachable code paths elsewhere (or whether the assignment is redundant/unreachable here) you need the definition/value/semantics of RN_Dash.\n\n4) MHD_YES and MHD_NO\n   - The function returns these macros and compares pp->ikvi return value against MHD_NO. Their exact definitions (values) matter when reasoning about branch outcomes and whether return statements can make later code unreachable.\n\n5) pp->ikvi (prototype/signature and documented return semantics)\n   - The function calls pp->ikvi(...) and branches on its return (if MHD_NO then set error and return). To determine whether the call can ever return MHD_NO (making the subsequent code unreachable) you must know the function pointer type, its possible return values and any documented behavior/side effects.\n\n6) MHD_POSTDATA_KIND\n   - This constant is passed to pp->ikvi; understanding what values are passed may affect whether pp->ikvi can fail and thus whether code after that call is reachable.\n\n7) memchr (prototype/semantics)\n   - The inner loop depends on memchr returning either NULL or a pointer within buf. To decide if certain loop exits/breaks are impossible (thus making following code unreachable) you must rely on the standard semantics of memchr (and any project-specific overrides).\n\n8) memcmp (prototype/semantics)\n   - Several branches depend on memcmp results (boundary match/no-match). To determine if a branch can be taken at all (and thus whether other code is unreachable), you need to know memcmp semantics (zero/non-zero meaning equality) and any constraints on its inputs.\n\nNote: standard macros like NULL and standard headers (string.h) are assumed; they are not listed separately. The above symbols provide the necessary type/range/semantics information to decide whether any statements or whole branches in process_value_to_boundary can never be executed (MISRA unreachable-code analysis)."
