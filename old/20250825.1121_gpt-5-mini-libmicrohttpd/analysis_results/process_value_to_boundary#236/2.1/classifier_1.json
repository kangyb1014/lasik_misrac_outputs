  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the memcmp call is reachable. Within the while loop, memchr searches for '\\r' only when (newline + 4 < pp->buffer_pos). If memchr returns non-NULL, newline is set to that position and the memcmp(\"\\r\\n--\", &buf[newline], 4) is executed. Thus the code fragment can be reached during normal execution and is not unreachable."
