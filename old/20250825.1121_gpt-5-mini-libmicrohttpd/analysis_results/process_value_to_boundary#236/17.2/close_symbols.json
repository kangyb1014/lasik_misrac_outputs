  "explanation": "To determine whether process_value_to_boundary violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect recursion you must inspect the complete call graph reachable from and into that function. Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- post_process_multipart: It is the immediate caller of process_value_to_boundary (per the static call graph). You must examine its body to see whether it (or anything it calls) can lead back to process_value_to_boundary.\n\n- MHD_post_process: It is a caller of post_process_multipart. Including it lets you examine higher-level call chains that might introduce cycles covering process_value_to_boundary.\n\n- find_boundary, process_multipart_headers, MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_, free_unmarked, __builtin_unreachable: These are the functions called by post_process_multipart. Any of them could (directly or transitively) call process_value_to_boundary and thus create indirect recursion; their bodies must be checked.\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (definition, especially the ikvi field): process_value_to_boundary calls pp->ikvi(...). You need the struct definition to locate the ikvi field, its type, and where and how it is assigned to determine which functions it may call at runtime.\n\n- pp->ikvi and all functions that can be assigned to it / implementations of ikvi: The indirect callback pp->ikvi is an actual call site inside process_value_to_boundary. Any function that can be stored in ikvi (or the code paths that assign ikvi) must be inspected because one of those implementations might call post_process_multipart or process_value_to_boundary, producing indirect recursion.\n\nBy examining these symbols (the caller chain, the callees of those callers, and the potential targets of the pp->ikvi callback), an analyst can determine whether any path exists that causes process_value_to_boundary to call itself directly or indirectly."
