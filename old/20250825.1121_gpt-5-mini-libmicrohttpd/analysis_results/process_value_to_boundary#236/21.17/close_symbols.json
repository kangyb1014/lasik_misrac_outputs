  "explanation": "To determine whether the memchr/memcmp calls in process_value_to_boundary can read beyond their object bounds you must know (1) the layout and semantics of the buffer memory addressed by buf = (char *)&pp[1] and the meaning/limits of pp->buffer_pos and pp->buffer_size, (2) the origin and size of the boundary object (boundary and blen), (3) the exact types/values used in comparisons/returns, and (4) the ikvi callback prototype because it is invoked with buf and lengths (it may constrain or mutate usage). Concretely:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): The function computes buf = (char *)&pp[1] and indexes buf using newline, newline+4 and newline+4+blen; to prove these indexings are within bounds you must know where the buffer storage begins in memory and how large it is (buffer_size) and how much valid data is in it (buffer_pos). You also need types of these fields (size_t etc.) to reason about underflow/overflow.\n\n- RN_Dash: The code assigns pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash; knowing its definition is needed for complete semantic analysis (and to ensure no side-effects that affect buffer bounds).\n\n- enum PP_State and PP_Error (and other PP_State values): The code sets pp->state = next_state or PP_Error and returns MHD_NO on error; knowing these symbols is necessary to understand control-flow and error paths that may affect buffer usage in callers.\n\n- MHD_NO, MHD_YES and MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: These macro/enum values are used as return values and as an argument to ikvi; you need their definitions for accurate control-flow/value analysis and to interpret the callback invocation.\n\n- prototype/type of pp->ikvi: The function pointer is called with buf and length parameters (buf, pp->value_offset, newline). Its parameter types and whether it may modify pp or buf are important to establish whether the buffer can be changed or reallocated and thus whether subsequent memcmp/memchr usage remains valid.\n\n- post_process_multipart (caller) and find_boundary: process_value_to_boundary is called from post_process_multipart; the boundary pointer and blen are produced/managed there (possibly by find_boundary). To show memcmp(&buf[newline+4], boundary, blen) and memcmp(\"\\r\\n--\", &buf[newline],4) are safe you must trace how boundary/blen are created and that boundary points to at least blen bytes, and you must verify how the MHD_PostProcessor object (pp) is allocated (so that &pp[1] indeed points to an allocated buffer of pp->buffer_size bytes).\n\n- memchr and memcmp prototypes (from <string.h>): For strict MISRA analysis you must use the standard function signatures (parameter types and behaviour) to validate that the size arguments passed are correct and cannot underflow/overflow.\n\nProviding these symbols allows the next analyst to verify the inequalities and invariants (newline + 4 < pp->buffer_pos, newline + blen + 4 <= pp->buffer_pos, and the relationship between pp allocation and &pp[1]) that guarantee memchr/memcmp do not access outside the referenced objects."
