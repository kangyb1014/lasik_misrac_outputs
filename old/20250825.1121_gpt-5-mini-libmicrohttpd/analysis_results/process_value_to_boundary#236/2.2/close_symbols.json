  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for a MISRA dead\u2011code analysis of process_value_to_boundary:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (definition): the function accesses many fields and relies on the concrete layout (buffer lives at &pp[1]). To decide if code paths are reachable you must know the structure definition and allocation pattern.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor.buffer_pos, MHD_PostProcessor.buffer_size: the loop and boundary checks use these to decide when to search, when to break, and whether the \"out of memory\" error path can occur. Invariants on these fields can make branches unreachable.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor.skip_rn, .state, .dash_state: these fields are written in the boundary-found branch; whether those writes are observable affects whether that branch is removable.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor.must_ikvi: used to decide whether the ikvi callback must be invoked. If the caller always sets this in a particular way, one arm may be dead.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor.ikvi (callback pointer), MHD_PostProcessor.cls, .content_name, .content_filename, .content_type, .content_transfer_encoding: the call to pp->ikvi() is a side\u2011effecting external call. To determine if the call (and its error return branch) is dead you must know the callback prototype, whether it can be NULL, and what return values are possible/used.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor.value_offset: updated and used to advance offsets; whether updates matter determines if related code is removable.\n\n- enum PP_State and PP_Error: state values assigned on error and normal progress. Knowing the possible states and how other code reacts is necessary to judge if the assignments are semantically needed.\n\n- RN_Dash: assigned to skip_rn when boundary found; you must know its meaning to determine whether that assignment has observable effect.\n\n- MHD_NO, MHD_YES: return constants used by the function and compared against ikvi return; need their actual definitions to reason about return\u2011value branches.\n\n- MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: constant passed to ikvi; affects behaviour/observability of the callback invocation.\n\n- prototype and semantics of the ikvi callback: essential to decide whether calling ikvi (and the code that prepares its arguments) has observable effects. If ikvi is a user hook with side effects, that code cannot be considered dead; if it is guaranteed to be a no\u2011op or always succeeds, branches may be dead.\n\n- post_process_multipart (caller): the caller sets up pp, boundary and blen and may enforce invariants (e.g. buffer_pos values, must_ikvi, ikvi pointer). Those caller guarantees are required to determine reachability of branches inside the callee.\n\n- find_boundary and process_multipart_headers (caller helpers): they can set or constrain boundary, blen, and pp fields; their behaviour may render some branches in the callee unreachable.\n\n- semantics/invariants of the buffer laid out at &pp[1]: the code depends on the layout and content of the buffer (search for CR, placement of boundary). Knowledge of how the buffer is filled and when buffer_pos is updated is required to decide whether e.g. the inner while ever finds a CR or whether newline remains zero.\n\n- memchr and memcmp (standard functions): their exact behavior (null return, byte comparisons) is used in loop/branch decisions; include to ensure standard semantics are assumed.\n\nIn short: to determine if any statements/branches in process_value_to_boundary are dead you must know the concrete definitions and runtime invariants for the MHD_PostProcessor type and its fields, the caller(s) that initialize those fields (post_process_multipart and its helpers), and the behaviour/contract of the ikvi callback and the constants used (RN_Dash, PP_Error, MHD_NO/MHD_YES, MHD_POSTDATA_KIND). Without these symbols and their semantics you cannot reliably prove a branch is never executed or that removing it has no observable effect."
