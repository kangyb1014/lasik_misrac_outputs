  "explanation": "Only control expressions are relevant for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The fragments listed above are all of the controlling expressions in this function (the outer while, the inner while, and each if that governs flow). They should be inspected to confirm they are not inadvertently invariant (or that they meet the stated exceptions). Other code constructs in the function are not controlling expressions (assignments, memchr/memcpy/memcmp calls used to compute values, updates of newline/offsets, break/continue statements, returns), or are function calls whose results are used in the listed controlling expressions; these do not themselves constitute additional control expressions that could violate Rule 14.3, so they do not require separate investigation."
