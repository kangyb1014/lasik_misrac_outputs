  "explanation": "To judge whether any controlling expression in process_value_to_boundary is invariant (and thus violates MISRA C), the analyzer must know which quantities in the loop/if conditions can change during iteration. The key controlling expressions are: while(1) (an intentional infinite loop \u2014 allowed by MISRA exception), while (newline + 4 < pp->buffer_pos), and the subsequent tests using pp->buffer_pos and pp->buffer_size and arithmetic with blen. Determining whether these are invariant requires: 1) the complete definition of struct MHD_PostProcessor (fields used in conditions and their qualifiers) so we can tell whether buffer_pos or other fields are modified inside the function, are volatile, or could be changed by called routines or external agents; 2) the exact prototype and semantics of the ikvi callback (pp->ikvi) to know whether calling it (or any similar callbacks) can modify pp->buffer_pos, pp->buffer_size, or any other fields affecting loop conditions; 3) the types/semantics of buffer_pos and buffer_size (size_t) and the arithmetic rules (wrap/overflow) to determine whether expressions like newline + blen + 4 can be invariant or UB; 4) the values and roles of RN_Dash, PP_Error, MHD_NO, MHD_YES and MHD_POSTDATA_KIND to understand assignments and return-value checks (needed to reason about loop termination paths and error exits); 5) the behavior of memchr and memcmp (standard library prototypes and that they have no side effects on pp or buffer_pos) to confirm they do not change the controlling variables. Finally, knowledge about whether pp or its members may be modified concurrently or by interrupt handlers (volatile qualifiers / concurrency model) is necessary: if buffer_pos can change asynchronously, expressions that look invariant to static analysis may actually vary at runtime and thus not violate the rule. These symbols collectively let the next agent decide whether any loop/if controlling expression is truly invariant in the implemented environment."
