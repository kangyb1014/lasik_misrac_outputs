  "explanation": "I flagged fragments that are explicitly marked by comments as \"should be impossible\" or guarded only by asserts (which are defined here as no-ops) and thus may be treated as always true/false by static analysis, potentially making other code paths appear unreachable. Specifically, the early-return checks (MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH, mod == 0, nc overflow) and the several mhd_assert() lines signal presumed invariants; any conditional branches that test the negation of those invariants or contain mhd_assert(0) are therefore suspicious for being considered unreachable. \n\nOther parts of the function need not be investigated for unreachable-code concerns because they are plain, mutually exclusive runtime branches that can be exercised by legitimate input variations: the three main outcomes based on nonce comparison (memcmp equal/unequal) and the three subcases for nc (nc > nn->nc, nc < nn->nc, nc == nn->nc) are all reachable depending on input values; the bitmask update code covers distinct numeric ranges (small jump, exact 64, large jump) and is reachable for corresponding nc differences; the mutex lock/unlock and the return at the end are obviously reachable. The timestamp handling depends on get_nonce_timestamp() which itself returns false on invalid parsing, so both the branch where parsing fails and the branch where it succeeds are reachable in normal operation. Thus I focused on assert-protected conditions, explicit \"impossible\" checks and the mhd_assert(0) path as the suspicious fragments to investigate."
