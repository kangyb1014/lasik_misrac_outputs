  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In the provided project mhd_assert is defined as ((void)0), so each mhd_assert(...) in check_nonce_nc becomes an expression-statement that has no observable effect at runtime. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, dead code is any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 that exactly matches these no-op assert statements. (Note: if the project were configured so that mhd_assert sometimes expands to a non\u2011no\u2011op in other builds, those occurrences would not be dead in that project configuration; but in the scenario given, with mhd_assert always ((void)0), the report of a Rule 2.2 violation is correct.)"
