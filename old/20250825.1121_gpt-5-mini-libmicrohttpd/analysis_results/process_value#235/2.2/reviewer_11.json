True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe mhd_assert(value_end >= value_start) call is a pure diagnostic check with no side\u2011effects when its condition is true. In normal operation the condition is expected always to hold (and earlier code already implies it), so the assertion only documents/diagnoses a precondition. Removing this assertion would not change program behaviour in the normal (non\u2011error) case, therefore the executed assertion is dead code. (If mhd_assert is implemented to abort on failure then it has an effect only on failure; however that does not change the fact that, for all normal inputs where the condition is true, the assertion is executed yet removable without affecting behaviour.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Under MISRA R2.2 an operation is dead only if its removal would not affect program behaviour. The mhd_assert call cannot be assumed to be pure/no-op for all builds or all inputs: assertion implementations commonly perform diagnostics or abort on failure, and removing the call would change behaviour in failure/error cases. Even if the condition is expected to hold in the normal case, the assertion documents and enforces an invariant and can affect behaviour for out\u2011of\u2011spec inputs (or when compiled with diagnostics enabled). The agent\u2019s argument only considers the \u201cnormal\u201d case and ignores error cases and possible side\u2011effects of mhd_assert, so it does not meet the criterion for dead code. Therefore the claimed violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
