True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nLikely yes. If mhd_assert is a diagnostic/assertion macro that expands to a no-op in production builds (for example #define mhd_assert(expr) ((void)0) when assertions are disabled), then the statement mhd_assert(xoff < sizeof(xbuf)); is executed but has no effect and its removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 therefore it is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, on the other hand, mhd_assert performs an observable action at runtime, e.g. aborts or logs on failure, then it is not dead.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent A\u2019s argument is plausible but not determinative from the code alone. Whether the mhd_assert(xoff < sizeof(xbuf)); statement is dead code depends entirely on how mhd_assert is defined in the project build: \n\n- If mhd_assert expands to a no-op in the production configuration (for example #define mhd_assert(expr) ((void)0) or similar), then the executed statement has no observable effect and its removal would not change program behaviour \u2014 i.e. it would constitute dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n\n- If mhd_assert implements an observable action (e.g. performs logging, calls abort(), triggers a diagnostic, or otherwise has side effects), then it is not dead code and there is no Rule 2.2 violation for that statement.\n\nThe provided source does not show the definition of mhd_assert or the build-time configuration, so you cannot conclude a definite violation from the snippet alone. To decide definitively, inspect the mhd_assert macro/implementation and the project build configuration to see whether it becomes a no-op in the delivered build. If it is a no-op, the report is correct; otherwise it is not."
