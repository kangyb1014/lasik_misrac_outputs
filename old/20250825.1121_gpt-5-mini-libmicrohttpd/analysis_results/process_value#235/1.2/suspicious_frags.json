  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided function. I specifically checked for and did not find: __attribute__ or __declspec, __asm / asm, __extension__, __builtin_* or other compiler builtins, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), GNU range designators ([0 ... n]), trailing comma in parameter lists, or other symbols explicitly documented as compiler extensions. Use of bool/false/true and fixed-size types (size_t, uint64_t) are standard C types (C99/C11). The expression (const char *)&pp[1] is plain pointer arithmetic to access data immediately after the struct (a common, standard idiom when the object was allocated with extra storage) and is not a language extension. The mhd_assert macro expands to ((void)0) (no extension). Array sizes are compile-time expressions (XBUF_SIZE + 1), not variable-length arrays. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
