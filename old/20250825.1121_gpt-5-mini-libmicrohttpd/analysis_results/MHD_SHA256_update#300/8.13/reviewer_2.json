True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf the prototype of sha256_transform is declared with a non-const pointer parameter (for example: void sha256_transform(uint32_t H[8], uint8_t *block)) but the function only reads from the block and does not modify it, then Rule 8.13 is violated. In that case the parameter should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. const uint8_t *block). Without the declaration of sha256_transform the compliance cannot be proven; however if the callee's parameter is non-const while it could be const, this call exhibits a Rule 8.13 violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A's assessment is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointer types to be const-qualified whenever possible; that includes function parameters that do not modify the pointed-to object. MHD_SHA256_update takes data as const uint8_t * and calls sha256_transform(ctx->H, data). If sha256_transform is prototyped with a non-const pointer parameter (e.g. void sha256_transform(uint32_t H[8], uint8_t *block)) but in fact only reads from block, then the callee's parameter could and should be declared const uint8_t *block. In that case the codebase would violate Rule 8.13. Conversely, without seeing the actual declaration of sha256_transform compliance cannot be proven. Therefore A is correct that a violation exists in the scenario described and the prototype should be changed to use a const-qualified pointer if the function does not modify the data."
