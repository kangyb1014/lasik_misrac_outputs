  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not present additional Rule 8.13 concerns. The parameter 'data' is already declared as 'const uint8_t *', satisfying the rule for that input pointer. The 'ctx' parameter is modified in this function (e.g. 'ctx->count += length', writes to 'ctx->buffer' via memcpy, and calls that update the state), so it cannot reasonably be a pointer-to-const and thus should not be qualified const. Simple control-flow constructs, arithmetic on 'ctx->count', the assertion, and length checks do not introduce pointer-to-non-const issues relevant to Rule 8.13. The fragments listed are the places where pointer const-qualification may be unclear (casts to uint8_t *, passing buffer/data to transform/memcpy) and therefore should be investigated further."
