  "explanation": "All other fragments implement the core update logic and must be preserved: the computation of bytes_have and increment of ctx->count update the context state; the conditional combining of buffered bytes (memcpy into ctx->buffer) and the call to sha256_transform are needed to produce correct block-wise processing; the while loop processing full blocks and the final memcpy of any remaining bytes to the buffer are necessary to maintain correct hash state across successive updates. Removing or altering those operations would change program behaviour (the produced hash), so they are not candidates for dead-code per Rule 2.2. The two reported fragments are candidates for investigation because (1) the assertion may be compiled out in production (so it may be effectively non-executing or no-op), and (2) the early-return guarded by MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE only short-circuits when length == 0; removing that return would not change the subsequent executed statements' effects (they handle length == 0 safely), so the early-return may be redundant/dead in some build configurations. Other lines (casts, memcpy calls, sha256_transform calls, assignments modifying ctx state and length/data pointers) have observable effects and therefore should not be treated as dead code without deeper functional evidence."
