  "explanation": "I found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code. The only standard-library function calls are memcpy (used to copy blocks of bytes) and an assert macro; memcpy copies memory and does not perform comparisons of null-terminated strings, so it is not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. No strcmp/strncmp/memcmp or similar string-comparison calls appear, so there are no code fragments that need investigation for this rule."
