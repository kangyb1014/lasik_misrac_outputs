  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in MHD_SHA256_update are invariant and therefore none require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.\n\nReasons (per controlling statement in the function):\n- mhd_assert((data != NULL) || (length == 0)): uses the parameter data and length (runtime values); not an invariant.\n- #ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE / if (0 == length) return;: the condition depends on the parameter length; it is not a compile-time invariant.\n- bytes_have = (unsigned) (ctx->count & (SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE - 1)); if (0 != bytes_have) { ... }: bytes_have is computed from ctx->count (a context field) and may vary at runtime; the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- if (length >= bytes_left): depends on the runtime parameter length and the computed bytes_left; not invariant.\n- while (SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE <= length): although SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE is a compile-time constant, the right-hand operand length is modified inside the loop (length -= SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE), so the controlling expression is variant across iterations and not invariant.\n- if (0 != length): depends on the runtime-modified length; not invariant.\n\nNo do-while loops or intentionally infinite invariant-controlled loops are present; the exceptions cited for Rule 14.3 do not apply. Therefore there are no suspicious invariant controlling expressions to report."
