  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect not only the function body but also the definitions/implementations and macro expansions of every external symbol it uses, and whether memcmp is reachable/used anywhere in those. Rationale for each symbol:\n\n- fseek: external library call (or wrapper/macro). Inspect its implementation or wrapper macros to ensure it does not call memcmp on NUL-terminated strings or expand to code that does.\n- fread: same as fseek \u2014 verify the implementation/wrapper does not use memcmp on strings.\n- ferror: verify whether ferror is a macro or wrapper that could hide a memcmp usage.\n- FILE: the type might be an alias or macro; check its definition in the environment to ensure no macro tricks that introduce memcmp usage.\n- SEEK_SET: a macro constant \u2014 check its definition only to rule out any unusual macro expansion that could include code using memcmp.\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: symbol used as a return value; it may be a macro or inline expression \u2014 inspect its definition to ensure it does not expand to or call memcmp for string comparison.\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: same as above \u2014 check its definition for hidden memcmp usage.\n- ssize_t: return type alias \u2014 inspect typedefs/macros to ensure no surprising macro-based implementation introduces memcmp usage.\n- size_t: used for sizes \u2014 check its typedef/macro only if macros are used in this build that could hide behavior.\n- uint64_t: inspect its typedef/macro similarly; ensure casts or typedefs are not macros that expand to code that could call memcmp.\n- memcmp: include the symbol itself so the analyzer can look up its definition/usage. If memcmp is called directly or indirectly (inlined, macro-wrapped, or used inside any of the above symbols' implementations), that constitutes a potential MISRA violation when it is used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\nIn short: examine the implementations and macro definitions of each of these symbols to ensure neither the target function nor any invoked/wrapped symbol uses memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings."
