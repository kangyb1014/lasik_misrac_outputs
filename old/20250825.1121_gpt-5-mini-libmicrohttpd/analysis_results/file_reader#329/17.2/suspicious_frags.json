  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The static function file_reader does not call itself and contains only calls to standard library functions (fseek, fread, ferror) which do not invoke user callbacks and cannot cause direct or indirect recursion into file_reader. The additional function MHD_create_response_from_callback merely stores the provided callback pointer (response->crc = crc) and does not invoke it; therefore it does not create an indirect call chain to file_reader in the shown code. There are no other calls or constructs in the provided snippets that could lead to direct or indirect self-calls of file_reader, so no fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
