  "explanation": "To prove the target function does or does not participate in direct or indirect recursion you must examine all functions it calls (and any call paths those functions may take back into file_reader). Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- fseek: file_reader calls fseek. You need fseek's implementation/call-graph to see whether fseek can (directly or indirectly) call file_reader.\n- fread: file_reader calls fread. You must inspect fread's implementation/call-graph to determine if it can call file_reader (for example, via stream hooks or wrappers).\n- ferror: file_reader calls ferror. Although unlikely to recurse, its implementation/call-graph must be checked for any indirect path back to file_reader.\n- FILE: file_reader treats cls as a FILE*. Whether indirect recursion can occur depends on how that FILE* was created (standard file stream vs. a custom stream with callbacks). You need the FILE type/representation to identify custom stream hooks.\n- fopencookie: POSIX/GNU API that creates a FILE* from user callbacks. If file_reader (or another function in the program) was used as a cookie callback, fread/fseek on that FILE could call back into file_reader \u2014 so fopencookie and its call sites must be inspected.\n- funopen: BSD equivalent to fopencookie; same rationale as above.\n- MHD_create_response_from_callback: this code appears in the libmicrohttpd context (MHD_* identifiers). There are library APIs that register read/seek callbacks (e.g., to serve file contents). If file_reader has been registered as such a callback, other library code may call it, producing indirect recursion; you must inspect these registration sites and their call-graphs.\n- fopen / popen: standard ways of obtaining FILE*. Include them to distinguish ordinary streams (which will not call user callbacks) from custom streams; their presence in the call-graph helps rule out or confirm callback-based recursion paths.\n\nNotes: constants used as return values (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM), integer types (ssize_t, size_t, uint64_t) and macros like SEEK_SET are not needed to detect recursion because they do not affect call paths. The essential part of the MISRA recursion check is the call-graph of the called functions and any APIs that can register file_reader as a callback into those functions or into the FILE* backing the stream."
