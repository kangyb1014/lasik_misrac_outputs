  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not use compiler-specific language extensions. The function body uses only standard C control flow, standard library functions (fseek, fread, ferror) and standard casts; types such as uint64_t and size_t are from the standardized <stdint.h> / C library. No compiler-specific keywords or constructs are present (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, or vendor-specific attributes). Therefore those parts need not be investigated for Rule 1.2. The listed fragments are provided for further investigation only."
