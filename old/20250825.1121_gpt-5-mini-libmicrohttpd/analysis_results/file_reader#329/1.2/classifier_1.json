  "scenario": "No compiler language extensions are used in the function signature. The types uint64_t and size_t are standard integer types; ssize_t is a POSIX/library type (not a compiler language extension). If your enforcement requires strictly ISO C types, ssize_t would be non\u2011standard and should be replaced or conditionally typedef'd, but that is not a compiler extension per the rule's requirement."
