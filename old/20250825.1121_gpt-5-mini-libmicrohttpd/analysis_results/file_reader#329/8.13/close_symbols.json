  "explanation": "FILE: the definition/type of FILE is required to know whether operations on a FILE object conceptually mutate the object (i.e. whether a pointer to FILE must be non-const). fseek: the prototype (int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence)) is required because it shows the function takes a pointer to non-const FILE and therefore may modify the FILE object; this bears directly on whether 'cls' (cast to FILE*) could/should be a pointer-to-const. fread: the prototype (size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)) and its semantics are required because it shows the data buffer argument is void * (non-const) and that fread writes into the buffer pointed to by that argument \u2014 this determines that 'char *buf' must not be const. ferror: the prototype (int ferror(FILE *stream)) is required because it accepts FILE * (non-const) and is part of the set of stdio functions that operate on and may observe/modify FILE state; it supports the conclusion about whether 'cls' can be a pointer-to-const. Together these symbols (and their prototypes/semantics) allow a determination whether the pointers in the target function could or should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule (i.e., they show that 'buf' and the FILE pointer are used in ways that require non-const pointers)."
