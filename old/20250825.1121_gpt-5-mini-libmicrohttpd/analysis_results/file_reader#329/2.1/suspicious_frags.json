  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related macros for unreachable code and found none. Each conditional path in file_reader can be reached at runtime: fseek may succeed or fail (so the if (0 != fseek(...)) return ...; is reachable), fread can return a non-zero byte count (reaching the final return) or zero (reaching the if (0 == bytes_read) branch), and within the zero case both outcomes of the ternary are possible depending on ferror. There are no statements after unconditional returns, no constant-condition branches, and no preprocessor-removed blocks in the supplied fragment that would create compile-time unreachable code. The comment about fseek size limits and the cast (long)pos are potential portability or correctness concerns but do not by themselves create unreachable code, so they are not reported here."
