  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are compile-time invariants. The function uses only the following runtime-evaluated control points, which therefore do not violate Rule 14.3:\n- if (0 != fseek (file, (long) pos, SEEK_SET)) \u2014 depends on the runtime return from fseek (and on pos/file); not invariant.\n- if (0 == bytes_read) \u2014 bytes_read is assigned from fread at runtime; not invariant.\n- the conditional operator (0 != ferror (file)) ? ... : ... \u2014 depends on the runtime state of the FILE stream; not invariant.\nThere are no while/for/do loops or if-statements with constant controlling expressions (e.g. if (0), while (1) etc.), and the macro constants (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM) appear only as return values, not as controlling expressions. Therefore no code fragments in the provided function require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
