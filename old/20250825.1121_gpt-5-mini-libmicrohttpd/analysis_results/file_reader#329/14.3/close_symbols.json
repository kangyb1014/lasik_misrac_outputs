  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in file_reader is an invariant, the analyzer needs the semantics, types and possible results of the I/O calls and the relevant macros/constants used in the controls and returns:\n\n- fseek: The first if's controlling expression is (0 != fseek(...)). You must know fseek's prototype, side effects and possible return values (and whether it could be a macro or inline wrapper) to determine if that comparison can ever vary at runtime.\n\n- fread: bytes_read is set from fread; the second if tests (0 == bytes_read). Determining whether fread can legitimately return 0 (and under which conditions \u2014 EOF, error, count==0, etc.) is necessary to decide if the comparison can be non\u2011invariant.\n\n- ferror: The conditional operator uses (0 != ferror(file)). You must know how ferror reports stream error state and whether its result can change after the preceding fread (i.e. whether it can be non\u2011constant at that point).\n\n- FILE: The stream object type is needed because fseek/fread/ferror semantics depend on the stream object; also to detect if FILE is a macro/type with nonstandard behavior on the target platform.\n\n- SEEK_SET: The value passed to fseek may affect fseek's behavior; know this macro to reason about the fseek call.\n\n- size_t, ssize_t, uint64_t: The controlling expressions compare/convert values of these types (fread return stored in size_t, cast to ssize_t on return, pos is uint64_t cast to long for fseek). Type ranges, conversions and any implementation-defined behaviour (e.g. truncation when casting uint64_t to long) can affect whether the expression outcome is invariant.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: Although they are used only as return values, an analysis of invariance should include whether these are macros or expressions with side effects; at minimum their definitions must be known to ensure they do not alter the control-flow expressions or embed unexpected behavior.\n\nTogether, these symbols let an analyzer determine whether the controlling expressions (0 != fseek(...)), (0 == bytes_read) and (0 != ferror(file)) can vary at runtime or are effectively invariant on the target platform/compilation."
