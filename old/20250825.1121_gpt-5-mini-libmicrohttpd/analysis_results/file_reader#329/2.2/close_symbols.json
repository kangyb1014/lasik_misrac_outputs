  "explanation": "For a correct MISRA-dead-code assessment you must know which operations in file_reader are observable and whether removing them would change program behaviour; each listed symbol is needed for that reasoning:\n\n- fseek: Has observable side-effects (changes FILE position) and a return value is tested. You must know its semantics and failure conditions to decide if the call (and the subsequent error-return path) can be removed without effect.\n\n- fread: Writes into the caller-supplied buffer and advances file position; it also sets stream error indicators/errno. Knowing that fread has these side-effects is essential to decide whether the fread call (and the bytes_read handling) is removable.\n\n- ferror: Examines the stream error indicator; the code uses it to choose between two return codes. You must know ferror semantics to tell whether the branch that inspects ferror is observable.\n\n- FILE (the stdio file type): The behaviour of fseek/fread/ferror is defined in terms of FILE internals (position, error indicator). The FILE type and its semantics are required to determine observable effects of operations on the stream.\n\n- SEEK_SET: The fseek whence argument value affects behaviour; include the macro definition to confirm the intended seek origin isn't aliased to something else.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: These return constants are how the function communicates observable results to callers. To decide whether returning a particular value (or the whole return operation) is removable, you must know their definitions and whether callers depend on them.\n\n- ssize_t, uint64_t, size_t: Precise type definitions (widths, signedness) are needed because casts/returns (e.g., (long) pos and (ssize_t) bytes_read) can change values or truncate them \u2014 such changes are observable and bear on whether the cast/assignment is dead.\n\n- All callers of file_reader (every function in the static call graph that invokes file_reader): Whether an operation is dead can depend on how the function\u2019s return value and side-effects are used by callers. If no caller ever examines the return code or the buffer contents written by fread, some return branches or writes might be removable; conversely, if callers rely on them they are live. You must inspect each caller to determine if removing operations in file_reader would affect overall behaviour.\n\n- Width/representation of 'long' on target platform: The code casts pos (uint64_t) to long for fseek. If long is narrower than uint64_t this can truncate or sign-change the argument \u2014 an observable effect. Knowing sizeof(long)/signedness is necessary to decide whether the cast or the fseek call is semantically significant (and therefore non-dead).\n\nInclude the above symbols/definitions (prototypes, macro/enum values, type definitions and the caller functions' code/usage) in the next-agent prompt so it can determine whether any executed operation in file_reader can be removed without changing program behaviour."
