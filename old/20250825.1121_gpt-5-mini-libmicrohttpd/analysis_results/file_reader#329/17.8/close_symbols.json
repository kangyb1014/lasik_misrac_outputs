  "explanation": "- fseek: its prototype must be known to confirm it takes a FILE * (not FILE **) and other arguments by value, so calling it cannot modify the pointer parameter 'cls' itself. Also confirms types of the second/third params.  \n- fread: its prototype shows it takes a void * buffer and FILE * by value (not pointer-to-pointer), so it may modify the object pointed-to-by 'buf' (allowed) but cannot modify the pointer 'buf' itself.  \n- ferror: prototype shows it takes FILE * by value, confirming it cannot modify the caller's pointer parameter.  \n- FILE: the type of 'file' / 'cls' is needed to check how FILE * is passed to the stdio functions (ensures no indirection that could modify the parameter).  \n- ssize_t: return type used in the function \u2014 include to ensure understanding of the cast/return (does not affect parameter modification).  \n- uint64_t: type of parameter 'pos' (already in code) included to make explicit that it is a value parameter (passed by value), so conversions/casts (to long) do not modify the caller's object.  \n- size_t: type of parameter 'max' and fread size arguments \u2014 confirms these are by-value types.  \n- SEEK_SET: constant passed to fseek (include to fully resolve the fseek call signature).  \n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: return constants used by the function (included for completeness); their definitions are not expected to affect whether any parameter is modified but are included so the analyzer has all symbols referenced by the function.  \n\nTogether, the stdio prototypes and the type symbols let an analyzer determine that all parameters are passed by value to called functions and that only the object pointed to by 'buf' may be modified (which is allowed by the MISRA rule)."
