  "explanation": "For a MISRA C assessment about use of string.h functions and out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses you must know which external functions/macros/types and which conditional branches actually participate in the compiled code and what those functions expect/perform:\n\n- sysctlbyname (function): The function is called with a string literal and a pointer/size for the result buffer. You need its prototype and documented behaviour to determine whether it performs any string handling (or buffer copies) that could access beyond the provided object (&ret, value_size) and whether the checks performed in the code are sufficient.\n\n- sysctl (function): Same rationale as sysctlbyname: it is called with mib[], &ret and value_size. Knowing its prototype and semantics is necessary to decide whether the call could internally perform string operations or copy more bytes than value_size (i.e. cause an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access of ret).\n\n- CTL_HW and HW_NCPU (macros/constants): These build the mib[] passed to sysctl. Their definitions/values and types confirm the expected meaning and that the call is the documented \u2018number of CPUs\u2019 query rather than some other identifier that might change behaviour or expected buffer size.\n\n- size_t (type): value_size is compared against sizeof(ret). You must know the width and semantics of size_t on the target platform to verify the size check logic and that the size comparison prevents out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n\n- NULL (macro): Used as pointer arguments to sysctl/sysctlbyname; must confirm correct pointer types/semantics are provided (NULL vs valid buffers) and no implicit string functions are used in place of expected pointer parameters.\n\n- Preprocessor symbols controlling compilation (__linux__, HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME, HAVE_SYSCTL, HAS_DECL_CTL_HW, HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU): These determine which branches (sysctlbyname/sysctl code) are actually compiled. To conclude that no string.h functions can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses you must know which code path is active for the build configuration.\n\nThese symbols allow the next analyst to (1) determine which code is compiled, (2) inspect the exact prototypes and documented behaviour of the sysctl/sysctlbyname calls (to see whether any string.h functions are used internally or whether the provided buffers/sizes are safe), and (3) verify that the size checks in the function prevent any out\u2011of\u2011bounds memory accesses."
