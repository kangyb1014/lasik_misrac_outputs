  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/MSVC-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions.\n- Preprocessor constructs (#ifndef, #if defined(...), backslash line continuation) are standard C preprocessor features, not compiler extensions.\n- The use of predefined implementation macros such as __linux__ is an implementation-defined macro provided by compilers, not a language extension construct in the source code itself (and is commonly used in portable conditional compilation).\n- Variable declarations inside blocks (e.g. size_t value_size = sizeof (ret);) and array initialization (int mib[2] = {CTL_HW, HW_NCPU};) are standard C (C99 and later). They are not compiler extensions per se; if a particular toolchain lacks C99 support that would be a configuration issue rather than an explicit use of a documented compiler extension.\n- Calls to sysctlbyname/sysctl are platform/library APIs, not language extensions.\n\nBecause none of the above constructs are compiler-documented language extensions, there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
