  "explanation": "The only potentially unreachable code in this function is the code that is conditionally included/excluded by preprocessor macros. The large block guarded by #ifndef __linux__ (and its inner #ifdef/#if blocks) may be completely omitted when compiled on Linux or when the HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME / HAVE_SYSCTL / HAS_DECL_* macros are not defined, which would make those source lines unreachable in that build \u2014 they therefore require investigation for Rule 2.1. Other parts of the function (initialization of ret, the runtime if (0 >= ret) checks, the sysctl/sysctlbyname call paths when included, and the final return logic) are controlled by runtime conditions and are reachable in builds where the corresponding preprocessor guards are satisfied; they do not constitute statically unreachable code and thus do not need further investigation for this rule."
