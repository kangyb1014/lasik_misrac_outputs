  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for checking unreachable code:\n\n- __linux__: controls the outer #ifndef. If defined, most of the function body is excluded at compile time; determining whether that block exists is essential to know if code is present (and potentially unreachable).\n\n- HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME: controls whether the sysctlbyname() block is compiled. Presence/absence determines whether that branch of code exists in the compiled unit.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCTL: with HAS_DECL_CTL_HW and HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU, controls whether the sysctl(mib,...) block is compiled. These feature macros jointly determine presence of that entire branch.\n\n- HAS_DECL_CTL_HW and HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU: feature-test macros used with HAVE_SYSCTL; each must be known to know whether the sysctl-based code is compiled into the function.\n\n- sysctlbyname: name of the called function inside the conditional block. Knowing its presence/prototype is not required to see reachability at compile-time, but its use indicates a runtime call that could affect control flow (via its return value and size checks). For reachability analysis you must know the call site exists in compiled code and that it can fail/succeed (the code after the call is reachable only if the call is compiled and the runtime conditions permit it).\n\n- sysctl: same rationale as sysctlbyname \u2014 it's the runtime call in the other conditional branch and its existence and behavior (return value/size semantics) affect whether subsequent statements can be executed; first determine whether its call site is compiled.\n\n- CTL_HW and HW_NCPU: constants used to initialize the mib[] array in the sysctl branch. If these macros are not defined the branch may not be compiled (they are guarded by HAS_DECL_*), and their presence is needed to confirm the branch is present in the final code.\n\nIn short: the preprocessor macros (__linux__, HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME, HAVE_SYSCTL, HAS_DECL_CTL_HW, HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU) determine which blocks of code are present at compile time (primary factor for unreachable-code detection). The symbols sysctlbyname, sysctl, CTL_HW, and HW_NCPU identify the specific compiled call sites and data used at runtime, which affect whether particular statements could be reached during execution."
