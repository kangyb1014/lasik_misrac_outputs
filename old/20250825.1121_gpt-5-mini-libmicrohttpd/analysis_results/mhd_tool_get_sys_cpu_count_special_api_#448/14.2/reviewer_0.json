First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for loop \"for (ret = 0; 0 != enb_set; enb_set &= enb_set - 1) ++ret;\" violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The first clause initializes the loop counter (ret) which is acceptable, but the third clause modifies enb_set (enb_set &= enb_set - 1) rather than only the loop counter. Clause 3 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter. In addition, the second clause uses enb_set (0 != enb_set) which is not a single Boolean loop-control flag and is being modified by the loop update expression, so the second/third-clause requirements are not satisfied.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the for statement \"for (ret = 0; 0 != enb_set; enb_set &= enb_set - 1) ++ret;\" the loop counter is ret, but the third clause modifies enb_set rather than only the loop counter. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the third clause to modify only the loop counter. Additionally, the second clause uses enb_set (0 != enb_set) even though enb_set is modified by the loop update expression; the second clause is only allowed to use the loop counter and optionally a single Boolean loop-control flag, and must not use other objects that are modified in the loop. Therefore both the second- and third-clause requirements of Rule 14.2 are violated."
