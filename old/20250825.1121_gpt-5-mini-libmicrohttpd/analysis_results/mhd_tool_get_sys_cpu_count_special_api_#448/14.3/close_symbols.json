  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_ is an invariant (i.e. provably constant at compile time), the analyzer must know which tests/loops are compile-time constructs vs runtime-dependent. The listed symbols are the minimal additional definitions that affect presence or runtime variability of those controlling expressions:\n\n- HAVE_PSTAT_GETDYNAMIC: Conditional compilation macro that determines whether the HP-UX branch (and its controlling expressions) exist at compile time. If undefined the enclosed if/conditions are not present.\n- pstat_getdynamic: Runtime function whose return value controls the if (1 == pstat_getdynamic(...)) test; needed to know this is a runtime value, not an invariant.\n- struct pst_dynamic: The structure type used to hold pstat results; required to understand psd_proc_cnt location and semantics.\n- psd_proc_cnt: Member tested by if (0 < psd_data.psd_proc_cnt) \u2014 needed to know it is a runtime-varying field, not a compile-time constant.\n\n- HAVE_VXCPUENABLEDGET: Conditional compilation macro that enables the VxWorks branch; determines whether the for-loop controlling expression exists in the compiled code.\n- vxCpuEnabledGet: Runtime function that supplies enb_set; the for-loop condition (0 != enb_set) depends on its return value, so this symbol shows the condition is runtime-dependent.\n- cpuset_t: Type of enb_set \u2014 required to understand semantics of comparisons and bitwise update (enb_set &= enb_set - 1) to judge if the loop condition can be statically invariant.\n\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: Conditional-compilation macros that control presence of the Windows-specific branches; they determine whether the Windows controlling expressions appear at compile time.\n- LoadLibraryA: Runtime function that may return NULL or a module handle; presence/absence of k32hndl affects subsequent if (NULL != k32hndl) checks.\n- GetProcAddress: Runtime resolver whose return may be NULL; used in tests like if (NULL != ptrGetActiveProcessorCount) and if (NULL != ptrGetNativeSystemInfo) \u2014 needed to mark those conditions as runtime-dependent.\n- FreeLibrary: Cleanup function; its presence is not relevant to invariance but the loader handle lifetime affects NULL tests; included for completeness of the Windows call sequence.\n- GetActiveProcessorCount (GAPC_PTR): Function pointer type and function invoked to get a runtime processor count; its return (res) drives tests and overflow checks, so it must be treated as dynamic.\n- ALL_PROCESSOR_GROUPS: Constant argument passed to GetActiveProcessorCount; knowledge of whether this is a compile-time macro constant is needed to see if the call is actually a runtime call with dynamic result.\n- GetNativeSystemInfo (GNSI_PTR): Runtime API used to populate SYSTEM_INFO; presence and result determine the if (NULL != ptrGetNativeSystemInfo) and subsequent tests on dwNumberOfProcessors.\n- GetSystemInfo: Fallback runtime API that populates SYSTEM_INFO and thus dwNumberOfProcessors; affects final controlling tests.\n- SYSTEM_INFO: Structure type whose member dwNumberOfProcessors is tested and assigned to ret; must be known to treat that member as runtime data.\n- dwNumberOfProcessors: Member used in comparisons and assignments that determine ret; required to decide whether controlling expressions depending on ret can be invariant.\n- DWORD: Windows integer type used in casts and overflow tests; knowing its width is needed to assess whether cast/overflow checks are meaningful (does not directly create invariants but affects reasoning about the comparisons).\n- HMODULE: Handle type returned by LoadLibraryA and tested against NULL; needed to reason that the NULL tests are runtime checks, not compile-time invariants.\n- NULL: Definition of NULL (compile-time macro) used in many pointer comparisons; required to understand pointer-vs-NULL tests.\n\nWith these symbols an analyzer can tell which if/for controlling expressions are only present due to compile-time macros (and thus can be removed) and which depend on runtime-returned values (and therefore are not invariant)."
