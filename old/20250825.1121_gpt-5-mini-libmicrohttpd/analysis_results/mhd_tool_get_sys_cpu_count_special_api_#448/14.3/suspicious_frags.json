  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant (i.e. constant at runtime or unchanging for the duration of the loop) and therefore no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Specific rationale for common control points:\n\n- The single loop: \"for (ret = 0; 0 != enb_set; enb_set &= enb_set - 1)\" \u2014 the controlling expression depends on enb_set, and enb_set is modified by the loop progression (the third expression), so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- The repeated checks \"if (0 >= ret)\" and similar if-expressions depend on the variable ret, which is modified in the various conditional branches and by function results; these are not compile-time or loop-invariant constant expressions. Although ret is initialized to -1, it is subsequently updated in different code paths, so the guarding ifs are not inherently invariant constructs.\n\n- Calls like \"if (1 == pstat_getdynamic(...))\", \"if (NULL != ptrGetActiveProcessorCount)\", and other checks involve function calls or variables that can change between evaluations; they are not invariant.\n\n- There are no do-while loops or intentionally infinite loops (e.g., while(1)) in the provided function; thus none of the rule exceptions (infinite-loop invariants or the do-while constant-false exception) apply.\n\nBecause every controlling expression either depends on a variable that is modified or on a function call whose result can vary, there are no fragments in this function that appear to violate Rule 14.3."
