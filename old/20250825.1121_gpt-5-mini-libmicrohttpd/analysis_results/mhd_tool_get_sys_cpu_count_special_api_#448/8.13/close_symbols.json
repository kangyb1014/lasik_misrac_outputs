  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA-C rule (pointer should point to const whenever possible):\n\n- pstat_getdynamic: The function is called with &psd_data. You need its prototype to know whether it takes a pointer-to-const or pointer-to-non-const (i.e. whether the pointer could/should be const-qualified).\n\n- struct pst_dynamic: Definition of this struct is required to determine whether any pointer usage or member access could/should be const-qualified; also to see whether pstat_getdynamic legitimately needs a mutable struct.\n\n- memset: The standard prototype (void *memset(void *s,...)) tells whether the destination parameter is non-const (it is), which is relevant to determine if the cast to (void *)&psd_data or use of memset violates the const-pointer guidance.\n\n- vxCpuEnabledGet: The function is called and its return is assigned to a cpuset_t. Knowing its prototype confirms it returns by value (no pointer) or by pointer, which affects whether const qualification applies.\n\n- cpuset_t: The typedef/underlying type is needed to confirm whether enb_set is an integer-like value (no pointer constness issue) or a pointer type (would require const analysis).\n\n- LoadLibraryA: Prototype shows it returns HMODULE and takes LPCSTR; you need this to check whether pointer parameters supplied (string literal) match const-qualified declarations and whether result handling involves pointers that should be const.\n\n- GetProcAddress: Its prototype and return type (FARPROC or equivalent) are required because the code casts its return through (void *) to a function-pointer typedef. You must inspect the declared return and parameter types to decide whether those pointers should be const-qualified and whether the casts circumvent const qualifiers.\n\n- FreeLibrary: Prototype is needed to confirm FreeLibrary takes HMODULE (no pointer-to-const issues) and to ensure resource handling does not hide pointer-const problems.\n\n- HMODULE: Definition/typedef is required to know if it is a pointer type; if HMODULE were a pointer typedef, const qualification might be relevant.\n\n- LPCSTR / FARPROC (GetProcAddress related types): The constness of the GetProcAddress parameter (LPCSTR is const char*) and the exact return type (FARPROC/void *) matter for analyzing whether the code passes and receives const-qualified pointers correctly.\n\n- GetActiveProcessorCount: The code calls this via a function pointer typedef; you need its prototype to confirm it returns a non-pointer (DWORD) and does not require pointer constness consideration.\n\n- ALL_PROCESSOR_GROUPS: This macro/constant is passed to GetActiveProcessorCount; include to ensure its type matches the expected argument type (WORD) and does not hide any unintended pointer usage.\n\n- GetNativeSystemInfo: Prototype shows it accepts a SYSTEM_INFO * output parameter. You must confirm whether the parameter is a non-const pointer (it is), which affects whether a const qualifier would be appropriate.\n\n- GetSystemInfo: Same as above \u2014 prototype shows SYSTEM_INFO * parameter type and whether it should be const-qualified (it should not, as it is an output parameter).\n\n- SYSTEM_INFO: Definition is required to see members (dwNumberOfProcessors is used) and to know whether SYSTEM_INFO or its address could be const-qualified (it is an out parameter, so typically non-const).\n\n- DWORD and WORD: Basic typedefs used in API prototypes and in overflow checks; necessary to verify whether casts between these integral types and int, and interactions with pointer-typed APIs, affect const qualification considerations.\n\nSummary: The analysis of whether any pointer in this function should be const-qualified requires the prototypes and type definitions of all called/used APIs and types that involve pointers (pstat_getdynamic, memset, Windows API functions and types, vxWorks API and cpuset_t). These symbols let the next agent determine whether pointers passed or received could/should be declared const and whether the code performs casts that remove const qualifiers."
