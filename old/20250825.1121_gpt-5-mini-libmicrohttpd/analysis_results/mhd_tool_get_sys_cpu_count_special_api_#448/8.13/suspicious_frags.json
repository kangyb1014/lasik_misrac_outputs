  "explanation": "I selected fragments that involve pointer use, pointer-to-function conversions, or void* casts where const-qualification of the pointed-to type might be relevant and therefore should be inspected for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Other parts of the function do not require investigation for this rule because:\n\n- Calls that pass addresses of objects intended to be modified (e.g., pstat_getdynamic(&psd_data, ...), ptrGetNativeSystemInfo(&sysInfo), GetSystemInfo(&sysInfo)) are output parameters and therefore should not be const-qualified.\n- The cpuset_t enb_set variable and its bit-manipulation loop are not pointer uses and so are outside the scope of Rule 8.13.\n- String literals (e.g., \"kernel32.dll\", \"GetActiveProcessorCount\", \"GetNativeSystemInfo\") are inherently immutable; the Windows APIs expect LPCSTR/LPCWSTR in their prototypes (const-qualified), so there is normally no additional const-qualification to enforce in this code beyond ensuring the API declarations are correct.\n- Function pointer typedefs cannot sensibly apply a const qualifier to the function type itself in C (const on a function type is not meaningful), so typical function-pointer declarations are not flagged for this rule unless they involve pointers to data that could be const.\n\nThe listed fragments should be investigated to confirm whether any pointer types could or should be declared to point to const-qualified types, and to verify that the intermediate casts (especially via void*) do not inadvertently discard const qualifiers or violate the intent of Rule 8.13."
