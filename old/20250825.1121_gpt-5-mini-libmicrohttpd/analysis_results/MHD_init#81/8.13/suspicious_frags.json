  "explanation": "The rule targets pointers that should be const-qualified when possible. The fragments above involve: (a) an API that stores a user-supplied context pointer (void *cls) and a panic callback pointer, (b) the MHD_PANIC macro invoking the panic routine with __FILE__ and string literals, and (c) calls that pass string literals or addresses of callback structures to library functions. These should be investigated to determine whether the pointer types (callback context, message/filename parameters, callback-table addresses) could and should be declared to point to const-qualified types.\n\nOther fragments in MHD_init do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointers-to-data that could/should be const, or the pointers are used as out-parameters or buffers that the callee is expected to modify. Examples of safe/irrelevant cases include:\n- Passing &wsd to WSAStartup: this is an out-parameter that the function initializes, so it must be non-const.\n- Calls such as gnutls_global_init(), MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_init(), MHD_send_init_static_vars_(), MHD_init_mem_pools_(): these contain no pointer-to-constant concerns in the shown code.\n- Use of NULL literals alone (e.g. passing NULL) is not meaningful by itself for const-qualification without inspecting the target prototype; where it matters the relevant call/prototype is listed above.\n\nTherefore only the listed fragments require further inspection for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
