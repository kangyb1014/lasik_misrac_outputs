  "explanation": "For checking MISRA 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' we must know which conditionals in MHD_init are compile-time constants, which are removed by preprocessing, and which evaluate at run time. The listed symbols are required for that reasoning:\n\n- _DEBUG: The if (1) block is inside #ifdef _DEBUG. Whether that invariant controlling expression is present depends on this macro.\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: Controls presence of the WSAStartup and subsequent if checks; if the macro is undefined those conditionals are not in the compiled code.\n- WSAStartup: Appears in the controlling expression if (0 != WSAStartup(...)). We must treat it as a runtime call (or detect if it's a macro/constant) to decide if the condition is invariant.\n- MAKEWORD: Used to build the argument to WSAStartup; could be a macro that affects whether the call is compile-time constant (unlikely) but included to be certain the call is not a constant expression.\n- WSADATA: The wsd variable and its wVersion field are referenced in a conditional; we need the type/semantics to know whether wVersion can be treated as non-constant.\n- LOBYTE / HIBYTE: Byte-extraction macros/functions used in the version check; need to know their definitions to see if they produce compile-time constants or depend on wsd.wVersion.\n- MHD_PANIC: Present in branches taken when checks fail; its definition could be a macro that affects whether surrounding conditionals are considered (e.g. if it expands to do/while(0) constructs), so include to be safe.\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: Controls inclusion of the whole HTTPS/Gcrypt/GnuTLS blocks; needed to know whether those conditionals exist in the compiled unit.\n- MHD_HTTPS_REQUIRE_GCRYPT: Selects the libgcrypt-specific branches; affects which conditionals (gcry_control, gcry_check_version) are compiled.\n- GCRYPT_VERSION_NUMBER / GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER: Preprocessor constants that determine which branches are compiled inside the HTTPS/Gcrypt area (they can make code appear/disappear at compile time).\n- gcry_control: Used in if (0 != gcry_control(...)); must be known whether it is a runtime call or a macro/constant so that the conditional can be classified.\n- gcry_check_version: Appears in if (NULL == gcry_check_version(...)); must be known if it is a runtime check or macro/constant.\n- gcry_threads_pthread / gcry_threads_w32: Passed to gcry_control; include to detect if they are constant/pointers that could make the call a compile-time constant (unlikely but necessary for sound analysis).\n- MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS / MHD_W32_MUTEX_: Compile-time flags selecting which gcry_control call is compiled; they alter which conditionals exist.\n- gnutls_global_init: Called unconditionally when HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined; included to ensure we know whether any surrounding conditional is actually unconditional or controlled by macros.\n- mhd_assert: The sizeof checks are inside mhd_assert and the if (1) block; we must know how mhd_assert is defined (expands to nothing in release builds?) because that can affect whether the assert expression and the enclosing if remain meaningful.\n- SIZEOF_STRUCT_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC: The asserted expression compares sizeof(tv.tv_sec) to this macro; need to know if that comparison is an invariant or is compiled out by mhd_assert.\n- SIZEOF_UINT64_T: The final mhd_assert compares sizeof(uint64_t) to this macro; include to determine if that expression is invariant and whether it is actually compiled into the final code.\n\nIn short: include all preprocessor feature macros that control inclusion of the conditional code, plus the functions/macros used in the controlling expressions (WSAStartup, LOBYTE, HIBYTE, gcry_control, gcry_check_version, etc.) and the assertion machinery (mhd_assert and size macros). With these symbols the next analyzer can decide which conditionals are present and whether any controlling expressions are compile-time invariants (for example the literal if (1) inside _DEBUG) or legitimate runtime tests."
