  "explanation": "- Preprocessor configuration macros (MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS, HTTPS_SUPPORT, MHD_HTTPS_REQUIRE_GCRYPT, GCRYPT_VERSION_NUMBER, GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER, MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS, MHD_W32_MUTEX_, _DEBUG): determine which blocks are compiled in or out. Unreachable-code checking requires knowing which #if/#ifdef conditions evaluate true at build time.\n- SIZEOF_STRUCT_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC, SIZEOF_UINT64_T: used in compile-time/constant-size assertions; required to know whether the debug-time checks are meaningful or compiled as no-op (affects reachability inside #ifdef _DEBUG).\n- MHD_PANIC: this routine likely does program termination (non-return); if it is defined as noreturn the code after its call may be considered unreachable on that control-flow path. Its declaration/attributes are needed to judge reachability.\n- _ (gettext): present in MHD_PANIC calls (string macro); included to ensure those calls are real calls and not macros that change control flow.\n- WSAStartup, MAKEWORD, LOBYTE, HIBYTE, WSADATA, wVersion: these Winsock symbols control runtime checks inside MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS guarded code. To determine whether those blocks are compiled and whether any compile-time constant makes them unreachable, their definitions/macros are required.\n- gcry_control, GCRYCTL_SET_THREAD_CBS, gcry_threads_pthread, gcry_threads_w32, gcry_check_version, gnutls_global_init: libgcrypt/gnutls initialization calls inside HTTPS-related conditionals; their presence/definitions (and any attributes such as noreturn or macros) affect whether those blocks are compiled or whether calls alter control flow (and thus produce unreachable code).\n- mhd_assert: used in debug assertions; its definition/behaviour (expands to nothing in release builds?) affects whether the enclosed code is reachable and must be checked.\n- iov_max_init_: transitive callee of MHD_send_init_static_vars_; include because the called function body (or macro) could affect reachability if it expands to e.g. compile-time constructs, noreturn calls, or conditional compilation that impacts overall function reachability.\n\nIn short: the listed macros determine which source lines exist after preprocessing (primary factor for MISRA unreachable-code violations), and the listed called functions/macros/attributes are needed to determine whether calls are non-returning or expand into constructs that make subsequent code unreachable."
