Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_init violates the MISRA requirement about well-formed for loops we must examine any code that can appear lexically or semantically inside MHD_init after preprocessing and linkage. For each listed symbol: \n\n- MHD_set_panic_func: Called directly from MHD_init. If this is a macro or inline function it could expand into or contain for statements or side\u2011effects relevant to loop-counter rules. Inspecting its body rules out such violations. \n\n- MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_init: Called directly; its implementation may contain for loops or mutate objects that would affect any for loop analysis if its code were inlined/expanded.\n\n- MHD_send_init_static_vars_: Called directly. It is known (from the static call graph) to call iov_max_init_, so its body (and transitive callees) must be inspected for for loops, control flags or modifications of objects used by any loop clauses.\n\n- iov_max_init_: Transitive callee of MHD_send_init_static_vars_. Its implementation might contain for statements or modify objects that would be relevant to the for\u2011loop rule when analyzing MHD_init (especially if any calls to it are inside a for in the compiled code).\n\n- MHD_init_mem_pools_: Called directly; its body may contain for loops or modify global/state used by loops.\n\n- WSAStartup: Called inside the MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS conditional. The presence of the winsock block is conditional; if compiled in, WSAStartup call and the surrounding code must be inspected (MHD_init contains conditional code that could include loops depending on macros).\n\n- MHD_PANIC: Used in error-handling paths in MHD_init. If MHD_PANIC is a macro or function with nontrivial expansion it could introduce loops or side effects that matter to the for\u2011loop rule; inspect its definition.\n\n- gcry_control, gcry_threads_pthread, gcry_threads_w32, gcry_check_version: Used within the HTTPS/libgcrypt conditional blocks. These symbols (functions or macros) must be inspected because preprocessor configuration can enable these calls; their definitions could contain for loops or modify objects relevant to loop control.\n\n- gnutls_global_init: Called under HTTPS_SUPPORT. If compiled in, its implementation must be checked for any for loops or interactions with loop-control objects.\n\n- mhd_assert: Used in the _DEBUG block. If implemented as a macro or function with side effects or loops it must be inspected. Also presence of the _DEBUG block is conditional, so the macro list below is needed to know if this code is compiled in.\n\n- Preprocessor condition macros (MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS, HTTPS_SUPPORT, MHD_HTTPS_REQUIRE_GCRYPT, GCRYPT_VERSION_NUMBER, GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER, MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS, MHD_W32_MUTEX_, _DEBUG): These determine which blocks of code are compiled into MHD_init. To know whether any for statements (or function calls that would be executed inside for statements) are present in the compiled MHD_init you must know the values/definitions of these macros. For example, enabling HTTPS_SUPPORT or _DEBUG can pull in additional code that may contain for loops; version macros change which branches are compiled.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA for\u2011loop rule applies to every for statement present in the function text after preprocessing and also requires reasoning about the behaviour of functions called from within a for body. Therefore to prove compliance (or find a violation) you must inspect all functions and macros that MHD_init directly uses (and transitive callees such as iov_max_init_), plus the preprocessor macros that govern which code is present. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to perform that inspection."
