  "explanation": "I selected the fragments above because they are operations that, as presented, appear to have no runtime effect (mhd_assert is defined as a no-op and the #ifdef _DEBUG block contains an unconditional if (1) whose only observable statement is an assertion that expands to ((void)0)). These are the most likely places to contain executed code that could be removed without affecting program behaviour and therefore warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n\nWhy the other fragments need not be investigated for dead code here:\n- The conditional winsock code (WSAStartup, WSADATA, and the associated checks) is an initialization with observable side-effects (network stack startup) when MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS is defined; it cannot be assumed dead.\n- The libgcrypt / GNUTLS conditional sections perform library-version checks and threading initialization (gcry_control, gcry_check_version, gnutls_global_init). Those calls have observable side-effects (initialising external libraries or causing a panic on failure) and therefore are not candidates for dead code without further build-context evidence.\n- Calls to MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_init(), MHD_send_init_static_vars_(), MHD_init_mem_pools_() are initialization routines that have side-effects required for correct runtime behaviour; they should not be treated as dead code.\n- Preprocessor-controlled code that is excluded by build configuration is unreachable in that build; per MISRA note 2, unreachable code is not considered dead code. Investigation should focus on code that is actually compiled-in and executed at runtime.\n- The MHD_PANIC macro (as shown) invokes mhd_panic and then marks the path as non-returning; that has an observable effect (panic/termination) and is not a no-op.\n\nTherefore, besides the explicit no-op assertion macro and its uses (and the redundant if (1) wrapper), the remaining lines in MHD_init perform initialization or library interactions with observable effects and are not reasonable candidates for dead code without additional contextual evidence."
