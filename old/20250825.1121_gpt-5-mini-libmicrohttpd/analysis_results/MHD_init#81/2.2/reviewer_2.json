  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. With _DEBUG defined and mhd_assert defined as ((void)0), the if (1) block in MHD_init expands to a block that only declares a local struct timeval tv; the assertion argument (sizeof(...)) is removed by the macro so no compile- or run-time check remains. The declaration has no observable side-effect at runtime (no initialization, no I/O, no function calls). Removing that if (1) block therefore does not change program behaviour, so the code meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note: the rule\u2019s timing caveat would only invalidate this conclusion if the presence of the declaration somehow affects observable timing or behaviour in the specific target \u2014 no such effect is shown in the scenario.)"
