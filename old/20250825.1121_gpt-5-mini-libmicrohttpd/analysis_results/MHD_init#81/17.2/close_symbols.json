  "explanation": "You must inspect the transitive callees and any functions invoked from MHD_init to determine whether any path leads back to MHD_init (indirect recursion). The static call graph already lists the direct callees (MHD_set_panic_func, MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_init, MHD_send_init_static_vars_, MHD_init_mem_pools_ and the known callee iov_max_init_). The additional symbols below appear in MHD_init (or are passed into functions called there) and therefore must be examined to rule out cycles:\n\n- WSAStartup: Called directly under MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS. Need its call graph to ensure it (or functions it calls) cannot call back into MHD_init.\n- MHD_PANIC: Invoked on error paths. Must check whether this (or functions it calls) can call MHD_init (or otherwise create a mutual recursion).\n- gcry_control: Called when initializing libgcrypt threading. Its implementation or callbacks it registers might call back into program code; examine for potential paths to MHD_init.\n- gcry_check_version: Called here and may call other library init code; include to ensure no callback into MHD_init.\n- gnutls_global_init: Called under HTTPS_SUPPORT. Need its call graph to ensure it doesn't indirectly call MHD_init.\n- mhd_assert: Assertion helper used here (macro or function). If it expands to a function call (e.g., logging/abort handlers), those paths must be checked for recursion.\n- _: The gettext/translation macro or function used inside MHD_PANIC strings \u2014 if it resolves to a function call, include it in the graph to rule out callbacks into MHD_init.\n- gcry_threads_pthread and gcry_threads_w32: Thread-callback objects passed to gcry_control; their code (callbacks) could be invoked by the crypto library and might call into program functions \u2014 include them to determine if any registered callbacks ultimately call MHD_init.\n\nExamining these symbols (their bodies or their call graphs) plus the already-known callees gives the transitive closure needed to determine whether MHD_init participates in any direct or indirect self-call, which is what the MISRA rule forbids."
