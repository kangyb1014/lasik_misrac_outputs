  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression compares the fixed address &aptr with *req_cls, which can vary at runtime (it is updated on the first call), so the condition is not invariant. A violation would only occur if *req_cls were a compile-time constant equal/unequal to &aptr (making the test always true or false), which is not the case here."
