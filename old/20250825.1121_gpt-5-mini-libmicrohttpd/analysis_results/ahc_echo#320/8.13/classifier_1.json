  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The parameter upload_data_size is declared as size_t *upload_data_size. In this callback it is not dereferenced or modified (it is cast to void), but the function must match the libmicrohttpd callback prototype which requires a modifiable size_t* so it cannot be changed to const. Therefore there is no MISRA 8.13 violation in this context. (If this were a freely changeable/local API and the pointer were never used to modify the pointee, it should be changed to const size_t * and would otherwise violate the rule.)"
