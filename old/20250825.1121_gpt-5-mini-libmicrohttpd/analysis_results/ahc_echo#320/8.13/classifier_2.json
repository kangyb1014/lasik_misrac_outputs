  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. The function uses req_cls as a modifiable pointer-to-pointer (it assigns &aptr earlier and later clears it). Rule 8.13 asks for const qualification when possible; here the pointed-to pointer must be modified, so it cannot be made const. Assigning NULL to *req_cls therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (A violation would occur if the pointed-to object were never modified and could be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type but was not.)"
