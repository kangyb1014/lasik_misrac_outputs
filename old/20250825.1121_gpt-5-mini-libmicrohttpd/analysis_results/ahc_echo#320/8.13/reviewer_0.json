True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameter 'cls' is declared as void *cls but the function does not modify or use it (it is cast away: (void) cls). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so this should be declared as const void *cls. (If the function signature is fixed by an external API that requires void *, then the API constraint is an acceptable justification for leaving it as void *.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 says pointers should point to const-qualified types where possible, but the ahc_echo signature is a callback whose parameter types are dictated by an external API (libmicrohttpd). The parameter void *cls must match that API\u2019s prototype; changing it to const void *cls would break the required signature. In addition, other pointer parameters (e.g. void **req_cls) are intentionally non-const because the function modifies *req_cls. MISRA allows the API-imposed signature to be an acceptable justification for not adding const, so this is not a violation here."
