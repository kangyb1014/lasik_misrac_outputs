Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect any function that the target calls (and their callees) because MISRA\u2019s for-loop rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body. For each listed symbol: \n\n- digest_get_hash_size: called directly by the target; its body must be checked for any for-loops and whether their clauses obey the rule. \n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash: called directly by the target; its own loops (and loop counters/flags) and the functions it calls must be inspected. \n\n- digest_init_one_time: callee of MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash; include because any loops here contribute to the effective behaviour of loops in the caller. \n\n- get_base_digest_algo: callee of MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash; include to check for loops or side effects that would affect loop well-formedness. \n\n- digest_get_size: callee of MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash; include for the same reason (possible loops or modifications of objects used as loop counters). \n\n- calc_userhash: callee of MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash; likely to contain data-processing loops \u2014 must be inspected for loop-counter usage, side effects, and modifications of objects used by surrounding loops. \n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex_z: called directly by the target; inspect for loops and whether third-clause modifications or body-side modifications violate MISRA. \n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex: callee of MHD_bin_to_hex_z; include because it likely contains byte-to-hex conversion loops and any loop counters/flags there must be checked.\n\n(Only these symbols from the static call graph are required to determine whether any for-loops that participate in the target function\u2019s behaviour are well-formed. Macros/constants or other unrelated callers are not needed for this rule check unless they are used as loop counters inside these functions.)"
