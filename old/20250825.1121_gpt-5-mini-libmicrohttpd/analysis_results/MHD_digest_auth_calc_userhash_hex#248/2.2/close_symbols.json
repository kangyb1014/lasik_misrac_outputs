  "explanation": "For MISRA C dead-code analysis you must determine whether any operation in MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex is redundant given the behaviour of the functions and constants it uses. Each listed symbol is required for that reasoning:\n\n- digest_get_hash_size: The function's return (digest_size) is used in the buffer-length check (digest_size * 2 + 1 > hex_buf_size). You need the implementation/contract to know possible return values and whether this check can ever be always true/always false (which would make the check or following code dead).\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash: The call can succeed or fail and produces the binary hash that is later converted. You must inspect its return semantics and side effects (whether it writes userhash_bin) to decide if the call (or subsequent conversion) is necessary or could be removed without changing program behaviour.\n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex_z: This conversion is the observable effect of the function (writes userhash_hex). To tell if that call (or the earlier binary computation) is dead you need to know exactly what MHD_bin_to_hex_z does (buffer writes, null-termination, dependency on digest_size) and whether it already guards against insufficient buffer length (which would make the explicit size check redundant).\n\n- MHD_bin_to_hex: MHD_bin_to_hex_z calls into this helper; its behaviour (especially buffer writes and termination semantics) is necessary to reason about whether hex conversion/size-checking code is required.\n\n- MAX_DIGEST: The local buffer userhash_bin[MAX_DIGEST] and the length passed to MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash use MAX_DIGEST; you must know its value to determine whether buffer sizing makes sense and whether parts of the function could be removed without affecting memory safety or behavior.\n\n- MHD_YES / MHD_NO (enum MHD_Result values): The function returns these; you need their semantics and any use-sites expectations to determine whether returns are meaningful or redundant in the broader program behaviour.\n\n- digest_get_size: Called (indirectly) by MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash; its behaviour influences how many bytes are produced by the userhash computation and therefore whether the hex conversion and buffer checks are required.\n\n- calc_userhash: The routine that actually computes the user hash. You must know whether it writes output, under what conditions it fails, or if it is a no-op \u2014 any of which could make earlier operations redundant.\n\n- digest_init_one_time: Initialization called by MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash may have singleton or time-dependent side effects. For dead-code analysis, an operation that only performs initialization might be required for program timing/initialization; conversely, if init is a no-op, calls could be dead.\n\n- get_base_digest_algo: Influences which algorithm digest_get_size/get_hash_size select; needed to determine variability of digest_size and therefore whether checks or conversions are ever effective.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any statements in MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash_hex can be removed without changing program behaviour you must inspect the called functions (and constants) to learn their return values, side effects (including initialization), buffer/write behaviour and whether any checks are redundant. The listed symbols provide that necessary context."
