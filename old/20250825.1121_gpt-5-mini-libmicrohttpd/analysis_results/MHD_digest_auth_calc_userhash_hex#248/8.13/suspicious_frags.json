  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameters 'username' and 'realm' are already declared as const char * (so they comply); 'algo3' and 'hex_buf_size' are non-pointer scalar types and not relevant to pointer const qualification; local scalar variables (digest_size) and macro uses (MAX_DIGEST) are not pointer declarations. The buffer length check and return statements do not introduce pointer declarations that could require const qualification. The listed fragments cover the remaining pointer uses (the output buffer parameter, the local byte buffer, and places where these non-const pointers are passed to other functions) which should be investigated to determine whether the pointers could or should be const-qualified or are intentionally mutable."
