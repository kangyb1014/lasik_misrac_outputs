  "explanation": "Other fragments (function signature, variable declarations of digest_size, the final return MHD_YES, and the simple early returns) do not themselves invoke or pass pointers to standard <string.h> functions and do not manipulate string/buffer lengths beyond the specific checks/calls listed above. The flagged fragments are the only places where buffer sizes, computed digest sizes, and calls that likely perform memory/string operations interact; they therefore require investigation for potential out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17. No other lines in the function use or propagate pointer parameters that could cause accesses beyond object bounds."
