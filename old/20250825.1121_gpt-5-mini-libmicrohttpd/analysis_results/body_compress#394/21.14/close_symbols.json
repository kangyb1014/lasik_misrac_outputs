  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA check on use of memcmp:\n\n- memcmp: Directly relevant to the MISRA rule. The analyzer must know whether memcmp is referenced in this translation unit (direct call or macro) or can be reached/aliased by any symbol used here.\n\n- compress: This symbol is called in body_compress. The analyzer must confirm it is the expected zlib function and not a project-local wrapper or macro that internally uses memcmp or expands to code comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- compressBound: As above, verify it is the zlib helper and not a macro/wrapper that could hide memcmp usage.\n\n- Z_OK: Used in the return-code check. Knowing its definition lets the analyzer reason about the control flow (success vs error paths) to see whether any path includes string comparisons (including via inlined/wrapped functions).\n\n- Bytef, uLongf, uLong: Typedefs used for buffer pointers and sizes. The analyzer needs their definitions to understand pointer casts and size arguments passed to called functions, to ensure there is no implicit or library-internal string operation on NUL-terminated data.\n\n- malloc, free: These standard allocation functions could conceivably be macro-wrapped in some builds; the analyzer must verify they do not map to project code that uses memcmp for string comparisons, and to reason about ownership/lifetime (not directly MISRA but needed to fully understand the function's behavior).\n\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: Definitions of the return-type enumeration and returned enumerators are needed to understand the function's intended behavior and control flow. This helps determine whether other code paths or macros (possibly tied to these symbols) introduce memcmp usage or string comparisons.\n\nNotes: body_compress has no direct callees beyond the symbols above according to the static call graph. To determine a MISRA violation you primarily need to confirm that none of the listed symbols (or macros/wrappers that they may resolve to) expand to or call memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings. If any of these symbols are macros or project-local wrappers, their definitions must be inspected to detect forbidden use of memcmp."
