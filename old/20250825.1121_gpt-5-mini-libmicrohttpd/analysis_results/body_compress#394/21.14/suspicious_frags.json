  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code (body_compress and the MHD_Result enum). There are no calls to memcmp anywhere in the code fragment, nor any other code that attempts to compare null-terminated strings (no char* string comparisons, no strcmp/strncmp/memcmp usage). The function deals with binary buffer compression (Bytef*, uLongf, malloc, free) and does not perform string comparisons. Therefore there are no locations in the given code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
