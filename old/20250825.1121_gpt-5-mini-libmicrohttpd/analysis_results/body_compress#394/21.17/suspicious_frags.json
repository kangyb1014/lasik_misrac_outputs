  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns direct use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The provided function body_compress does not call any of these functions. The only external/library calls are compressBound and compress (zlib), and the standard memory allocation functions malloc/free; there are pointer casts ((const Bytef *) *buf and (void *) cbuf) and size conversions, but none are string.h calls that could directly violate Rule 21.17. If the implementation of the external compress() routine itself uses string.h functions internally, that implementation would need to be reviewed separately \u2014 but there are no string.h function usages in this code fragment to investigate for Rule 21.17."
