  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the MHD_DLOG prototype takes a const char *format, so the string literals and returned char * values (e.g. from strerror via MHD_socket_strerr_) are passed to a const-qualified parameter. There is no pointer variable in this fragment that could/should be more const-qualified. Passing a non-const char * to a const char * parameter is allowed and does not breach Rule 8.13. (If the code instead stored the result of strerror into a non-const pointer variable that could have been declared const, that would be a potential violation, but that is not the case here.)"
