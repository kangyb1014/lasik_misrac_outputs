  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The macro MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ merely expands to a call to the function MHD_mutex_lock_ and to MHD_PANIC; the macro itself is not a function and does not call itself. Rule 17.2 would be violated only if one of the called functions were implemented so that it (directly or indirectly) called back into MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ or into a function that uses it, e.g. if MHD_mutex_lock_ were implemented as: bool MHD_mutex_lock_(pmutex){ MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(pmutex); return true; } which would create infinite recursion."
