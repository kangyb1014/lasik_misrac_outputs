  "explanation": "No direct self-call to MHD_increment_response_rc exists in the shown code. The only places that can introduce indirect recursion are the calls/macros listed above because they invoke other functions (MHD_mutex_lock_, MHD_mutex_unlock_, and MHD_PANIC). The increment expression itself is a simple arithmetic side-effect and does not call functions. Preprocessor conditionals only control whether the mutex-call sites are present; they do not introduce recursion by themselves. Therefore only the listed call sites and the macros (and the functions those macros expand to) need investigation for possible indirect recursion; other fragments in the provided code do not require further investigation for Rule 17.2."
