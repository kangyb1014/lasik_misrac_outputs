  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp or any string-comparison function, nor any operations on null-terminated strings. It only conditionally calls MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ / MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ and increments an integer reference_count. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
