  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required\n\n1) MHD_mutex_lock_chk_\n   - This function is called (conditionally) from the target function. To decide whether the target function violates the MISRA for-loop rule we must inspect any for-loops that appear inside functions it calls, because \"the behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\" If MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ contains any for loops, or if it modifies objects that could be used as loop counters elsewhere, that could affect compliance analysis. Also the implementation may be a macro/inline that expands to code containing loops or side-effects.\n\n2) MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_\n   - Same reasoning as for MHD_mutex_lock_chk_. Unlock may be implemented inlined or contain loops/side-effects. We need its definition to check for any for-loops and to ensure it does not modify objects that would violate the rule when called from this function.\n\n3) struct MHD_Response (definition)\n   - The target function increments response->reference_count and uses response->mutex. To reason about whether that modification could interact with a for-loop (e.g. if reference_count is used as a loop counter elsewhere or if a loop uses objects that are modified in this function), we need the full struct definition: member types, qualifiers (volatile, atomic), and any accessor macros. The type of reference_count and whether it is shared/atomic affects whether increments are side-effects relevant to MISRA rules.\n\n4) type of response->reference_count (exact typedef)\n   - The MISRA rule refers to loop counters and objects modified in the loop body. Knowing the exact type (int, unsigned, atomic_t, size_t, volatile int, etc.) and whether it may be a loop counter elsewhere is required. Also qualifiers (volatile) may change whether an expression is considered to have persistent side-effects.\n\n5) MHD_mutex (type / definition)\n   - The mutex member's type (and any associated macros or inline operations) is necessary because locking/unlocking may be implemented as macros or inline functions that include loops or modify global/state objects. The concrete mutex implementation (POSIX pthread_mutex_t, Win32 CRITICAL_SECTION, or wrapper) must be examined for loops/side-effects.\n\n6) MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS (macro)\n   - The lock/unlock calls are conditionally compiled. To know whether those calls are present in the compiled target function (and therefore whether the called lock/unlock implementations must be inspected), we need the value of this macro in the build configuration.\n\n7) MHD_USE_W32_THREADS (macro)\n   - Same as MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS: determines which conditional compilation path is active and therefore which code (and potential loops) are present.\n\nNotes / scope\n- The target function itself contains no for statements, so a direct violation inside this function is not expected. However MISRA's requirement that the behaviour of a for loop body includes behaviour of any functions called inside it makes the definitions of the called functions necessary for a complete analysis (in case those called functions define or affect for-loops or modify loop-counter objects). The listed symbols are the minimal additional items needed to determine whether any code exercised by this function (via direct calls or conditional compilation) contains for-loops or side-effects relevant to the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule."
