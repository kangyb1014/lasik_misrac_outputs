  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided function. Rationale:\n\n- The function contains only two conditional-compilation blocks (mutex lock/unlock) and an increment of response->reference_count. The provided additional code defines MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS, so the lock/unlock code is compiled in and reachable at runtime.\n- There are no early returns, infinite loops, or unconditional non-returning calls (e.g., calls to functions that are guaranteed not to return) that would make subsequent statements unreachable. The MHD_PANIC() call inside the MHD_mutex_*_chk_ macros is invoked only on the failure branch of an if and so does not render the following statements statically unreachable.\n- No dead-code preprocessor branches (for example #if 0) are present in the supplied fragments.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied snippets that need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
