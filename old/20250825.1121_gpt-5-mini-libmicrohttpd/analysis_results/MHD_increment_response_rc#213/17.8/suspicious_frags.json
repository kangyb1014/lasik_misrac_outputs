  "explanation": "No fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is the pointer 'response'. The code does not assign to or modify the pointer variable itself (no statements like 'response = ...' or 'response++'). The increment '(response->reference_count)++' modifies the object pointed to by the parameter (a member of *response), which the rule explicitly permits. The calls MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(&response->mutex) and MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(&response->mutex) take the address of a member of *response but do not modify the pointer parameter itself. Therefore there is no apparent violation of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
