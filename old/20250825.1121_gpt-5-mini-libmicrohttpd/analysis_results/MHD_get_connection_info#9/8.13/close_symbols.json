  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection (complete definition): The function takes a pointer to this struct and returns the address of connection->connection_info_dummy. To check whether any pointer members inside that struct (or the struct itself) should be const-qualified we must know the exact member types and whether they are pointers to mutable data.\n\n- union MHD_ConnectionInfo (complete definition): The function returns a pointer to this union (const union MHD_ConnectionInfo *). To judge whether the pointed-to type and any pointer fields contained in it should have been declared const (per MISRA rule), we must see each field type (particularly pointer fields such as tls_session, socket_context, daemon, client_addr if pointer, etc.).\n\n- typedef/definition of tls_session type (e.g. gnutls_session_t): The code assigns connection->tls_session into connection_info_dummy.tls_session and returns the union address. If tls_session is a pointer type, MISRA may require it be const-qualified when exposed; knowing its exact type is necessary.\n\n- MHD_get_master prototype and its return type: The daemon field of the returned union is set to MHD_get_master(connection->daemon). The type returned (pointer or non-pointer) determines whether that pointer should be const-qualified in the union or in the struct.\n\n- definition of connection->addr type and connection_info_dummy.client_addr type: memcpy copies these by value; to decide constness we need to know if these are arrays/structs or pointers. If client_addr is a pointer type, it may need const qualification.\n\n- type/definition of connection->socket_context: The union stores socket_context from the connection. If this is a pointer type, we must know whether it should be const-qualified when exposed to callers.\n\n- type/definition of connection->daemon member: Used as argument to MHD_get_master; its type affects whether the returned daemon pointer in the union should be const-qualified.\n\n- definitions of connection->rq and connection->rp structures (rq.header_size, rp.response, rp.responseCode): rp.response is tested for NULL; if rp.response is a pointer to mutable data that is exposed through the returned union/struct, constness may be required. header_size and responseCode types are needed to know whether non-pointer fields are involved (constness rule targets pointers but knowledge of related fields helps analysis).\n\n- definition/type of connection->suspended and the MHD_YES / MHD_NO values: The function writes a suspended value into the union. If suspended is or contains pointers, their constness must be known; also the type helps determine if any pointer qualification is relevant.\n\n- types of connection->connection_timeout_ms and connection_info_dummy.connection_timeout (and UINT_MAX / relevant limits macros): The code computes and stores connection_timeout; knowing the types confirms this is not a pointer-related issue but is required to show which fields are pointers vs scalars.\n\n- definitions of enum MHD_ConnectionInfoType and the MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_* enumerators used: To ensure all handled cases and the mapping to union fields are correct when reasoning about which pointer fields may be exposed and whether they should be const-qualified.\n\n- definitions of MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_RECEIVED and MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED state constants: These determine the early-return for header_size. Knowing the state type clarifies whether any pointer fields might be returned before being initialized.\n\nIn short: to assess whether the function violates the MISRA guideline about pointing to const-qualified types we must see the exact types (pointer vs non-pointer) of every member copied into/returned through the union and the union definition itself. The listed symbols supply that type information."
