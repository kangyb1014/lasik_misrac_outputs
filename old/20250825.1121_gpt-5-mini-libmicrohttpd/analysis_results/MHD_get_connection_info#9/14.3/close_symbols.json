  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to check MISRA C rule \u2018Controlling expressions shall not be invariant\u2019: \n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (preprocessor macro)\n  - The invariant-looking \"if (1)\" blocks are inside the #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT region. Whether that region is compiled (and therefore whether the invariant controlling expression appears in the compiled code) depends on this macro. To decide if the source as compiled violates the MISRA rule we must know if HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition)\n  - Many controlling expressions reference fields of the connection argument (e.g. connection->tls_session, connection->addr_len, connection->state, connection->rp.response, connection->suspended, connection->connection_timeout_ms). To determine whether those controlling expressions are truly runtime-dependent (not invariant) we must see the field types and whether any fields are in fact compile-time constants (or macros). The struct definition also shows connection_info_dummy and other fields used in the function.\n\n- SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_INT and SIZEOF_UINT64_T (preprocessor macros)\n  - There is a preprocessor conditional (#if SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_INT <= (SIZEOF_UINT64_T - 2)) that controls compilation of an if-statement. Whether that if-statement (and thus its controlling expression) is present in the compiled code depends on these macros. Knowing their values is required to know which controlling expressions actually exist after preprocessing.\n\n- UINT_MAX (limits.h constant)\n  - Used in the condition \"if (UINT_MAX < connection->connection_timeout_ms / 1000)\". Although UINT_MAX is a constant, the whole comparison involves a runtime field; still, to reason about the possibility of the condition being a compile-time invariant in some build configurations you need the value of UINT_MAX in the target environment.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_RECEIVED and MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED (enum or macro values)\n  - These constants appear in the controlling expression that checks connection->state. To determine whether that compound expression can be invariant (for example because state has a restricted set of compile-time-known values in a particular build) we need the numeric definitions of these constants.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro)\n  - The code contains an mhd_assert(sizeof(...) == sizeof(...)). The expansion of this macro could introduce controlling expressions (some assert macros expand to if/while constructs) or suppress code in certain builds (e.g. disabled in NDEBUG). Knowing its definition helps decide whether that line or its expansion introduces any invariant controlling expressions or changes control flow.\n\nNote: the literal constant \"1\" in the explicit \"if (1)\" is obviously an invariant controlling expression. The crucial question for MISRA compliance is whether that invariant is present in the compiled code (depends on HTTPS_SUPPORT) and whether any of the other conditions are actually compile-time constants in the target build (depends on the struct definition and the listed preprocessor constants/macros). The symbols above are the minimal additional definitions required to make that determination."
