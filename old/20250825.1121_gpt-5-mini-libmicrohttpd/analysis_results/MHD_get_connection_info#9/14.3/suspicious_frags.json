  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the function depend on runtime state or parameters (e.g. NULL checks on connection->tls_session, comparisons involving connection->addr_len, connection->state, connection->rp.response, connection_timeout_ms, etc.), so they are not invariant and do not trigger Rule 14.3. Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT, #if SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_INT <= ...) are evaluated at compile time and are not runtime controlling expressions subject to this rule. The switch uses the runtime parameter info_type as its controlling expression. Therefore the only invariant controlling expressions present are the two explicit \"if (1)\" blocks (reported above) and these should be investigated for compliance with Rule 14.3."
