  "explanation": "To decide whether any operations in MHD_get_connection_info are dead (i.e. their removal would not affect program behaviour) we must know which results of those operations can be observed and whether any calls have side effects. Concretely:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): needed to see the exact storage layout and types of every member accessed (tls_session, addr_len, addr, connection_info_dummy, daemon, socket_fd, socket_context, suspended, connection_timeout_ms, state, rq, rp). Without the struct definition you cannot tell whether writes into those members are observable elsewhere or alias other storage (affects dead-code determination).\n\n- union MHD_ConnectionInfo (full definition): the function returns pointers to this union and writes into various fields. If several fields share storage (union), writing one field might clobber another; conversely, some writes might be irrelevant because those union members are never read. You must know the union layout to decide if those writes are useful.\n\n- enum MHD_ConnectionInfoType and MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_* constants: required to know the full set of possible info_type values and whether some switch branches are unreachable given project-wide uses or assumptions.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (build-time macro): the TLS-related cases are guarded by this macro. Whether that code is present in the build (and therefore possibly dead or live) depends on the define; must know build configuration.\n\n- gnutls_cipher_get and gnutls_protocol_get_version and their return types (gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t, gnutls_protocol_t): needed to determine if those calls have observable side effects beyond returning a value. If they have side effects, they cannot be removed even if the stored result is unused. If they are pure getters, removal might be dead if result never read.\n\n- MHD_get_master (declaration & semantics): called to obtain daemon value \u2014 if MHD_get_master has side effects, that call is not dead. Even though it appears in the static graph, its semantics must be known.\n\n- All call sites of MHD_get_connection_info and any direct accesses to connection->connection_info_dummy: to establish whether the values written into connection_info_dummy by this function are ever consumed. If no callers read the written fields (or if no callers exist), many writes (and even the function) could be dead. The static call graph given shows no callers, but a full-code search/knowledge of indirect calls is required.\n\n- Definitions of connection->rq and connection->rp and their members (header_size, response, responseCode): to know whether the checks/reads performed here are meaningful and whether their results are observed elsewhere.\n\n- MHD_YES / MHD_NO and state constants MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_RECEIVED, MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED: required to understand the conditional logic that determines whether branches execute and whether writes (e.g. suspended flag) are meaningful.\n\n- SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_INT, SIZEOF_UINT64_T, UINT_MAX: these configuration constants affect whether the conditional compilation / runtime branch that clamps connection_timeout is active; they influence whether the assignment is a no-op on the target platform.\n\n- mhd_assert macro: assertions might be compiled out; if enabled they may have side effects or abort \u2014 affects whether that statement is removable.\n\n- memcpy (declaration/semantics): copying client address may be important; if the copy never results in an observed value, it could be dead. Knowing which memcpy implementation is used and whether it has side effects is necessary.\n\nIn short, to determine if any writes/operations inside MHD_get_connection_info are dead you must know (a) which of those writes are ever read elsewhere (callers or direct accesses to the connection object), (b) whether called functions have side effects, and (c) build-time configuration that enables/disables blocks. The symbols above are precisely those needed to answer those questions."
