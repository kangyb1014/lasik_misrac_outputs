  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are not reported because they do not appear to be dead code: most assignments write into connection->connection_info_dummy and are followed by returning a pointer to that structure, so removing those assignments would change observable behavior. Early-return checks (e.g. NULL checks, state checks) affect control flow and thus are not dead. The conditional compilation around HTTPS_SUPPORT and SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_INT controls which code is compiled for a build; those variants are purposeful and not dead within their respective configurations. The default case and other case handlers return values based on connection state or fields (socket fd, socket_context, suspended flag, timeout computation, header_size, http_status), all of which are used by the caller and so are not dead. The fragments selected above are suspicious because they include constant-condition if(1) constructs (likely redundant or intended only to suppress warnings) and an assertion macro line that may compile out (potentially leaving code that has no runtime effect), and a group of empty case labels produced by the #else branch that trivially fall through \u2014 each of these warrants review to determine whether they constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
