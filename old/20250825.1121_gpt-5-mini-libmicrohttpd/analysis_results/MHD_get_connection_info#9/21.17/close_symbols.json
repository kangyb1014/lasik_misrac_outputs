  "explanation": "For checking the memcpy use against the MISRA <string.h> bounds rule you must know the actual object sizes and the effect of the assertion: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): the target function reads many fields from the connection object; most importantly addr, addr_len and connection_info_dummy are members. The struct definition lets you locate these members and see their types and sizes (and verify there is no aliasing or unusual layout). \n\n- type/definition of connection->addr (e.g. struct sockaddr/struct sockaddr_storage) and its sizeof(): memcpy copies sizeof(connection->addr) bytes from &connection->addr. To determine whether that read stays within the source object bounds you must know the compile-time size and representation of this member.\n\n- type/definition of connection->connection_info_dummy and its client_addr member and its sizeof(): memcpy writes into connection_info_dummy.client_addr. To ensure the destination access is within bounds you must know the destination member type and its size and confirm it is large enough for the requested copy.\n\n- connection->addr_len (semantics/documentation): the code checks only that addr_len > 0 before copying. You need the semantic meaning of addr_len (is it the actual number of valid bytes in addr, a socklen_t, etc.) to judge whether copying sizeof(addr) bytes could read past the meaningful/valid data (even if within the object memory) or indicate a logic flaw that could lead to out-of-bounds access in other contexts.\n\n- mhd_assert macro/function definition: the code relies on mhd_assert(sizeof(addr) == sizeof(client_addr)) immediately before memcpy. If mhd_assert can be compiled out (e.g., becomes a no-op in release builds), that check may not actually prevent a mismatched-size copy. Knowing the exact definition/behavior of mhd_assert is required to decide if the size-equality check is enforced at runtime/compile-time or omitted, which affects whether the memcpy may access out-of-bounds memory.\n\n(You do not need MHD_get_master or unrelated macros to reason about this memcpy safety; the items above provide the necessary object sizes, semantics and assertion behavior to evaluate the MISRA rule.)"
