  "explanation": "To judge whether any of the case blocks or statements in MHD_get_connection_info are unreachable you must know: (1) which case labels actually exist at compile time (the enum values listed and the HTTPS_SUPPORT macro control whether the large HTTPS-specific blocks are compiled or not); (2) compile-time size macros (SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_INT, SIZEOF_UINT64_T, UINT_MAX) that govern whether the connection-timeout code is compiled or generates a different runtime path; (3) the exact layout and types of struct MHD_Connection and of connection->connection_info_dummy so you can determine whether assignments and returns are valid and whether any branches depending on those fields can ever be taken (for example addr_len, state, rq.header_size, rp.response); (4) the state constants (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_RECEIVED, MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED) used in the REQUEST_HEADER_SIZE case, because their values relative to connection->state determine reachability of that return path; (5) the existence and prototypes of called functions and types used only in certain cases (MHD_get_master, gnutls_cipher_get, gnutls_protocol_get_version and their GNUTLS types) because those calls are reachable only when their cases are selected; and (6) auxiliary helpers used in the code (mhd_assert, memcpy, MHD_YES/MHD_NO) to confirm those statements are real code paths rather than macros that might remove or change code flow. All of the above affect which code is actually present after preprocessing and which switch branches can be selected at runtime \u2014 both are required to determine whether any code within MHD_get_connection_info is unreachable (MISRA's unreachable-code concern)."
