  "explanation": "No function parameter is reassigned in this function. The parameters are: (struct MHD_Connection *connection), (enum MHD_ConnectionInfoType info_type) and the variadic arguments. The code only: - dereferences the pointer parameter (connection->...) to read or assign fields of the pointed-to object (allowed by the rule), - compares the pointer to NULL, - uses local variables (e.g. res) and assigns into connection->connection_info_dummy members, - uses memcpy with the address of members of *connection, and - returns addresses of members of *connection. There are no assignments to the parameter identifiers themselves (no statements like connection = ..., info_type = ..., or modification via pointer arithmetic). The variadic arguments are not accessed/modified. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs investigation under that rule."
