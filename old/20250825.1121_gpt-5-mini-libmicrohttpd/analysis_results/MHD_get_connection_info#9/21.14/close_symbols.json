  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_connection_info violates the MISRA rule banning the use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must check any direct, indirect or hidden use of memcmp and confirm that memory operations are on binary buffers (addresses) not C strings. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- memcmp: The primary symbol of the MISRA rule. Inspect whether this function is called directly in the target function (or via macros/aliases) to compare strings.\n- memcpy: The function present in the target code; we must confirm it is a copy of a binary address structure (safe) and not a mistaken replacement/alias of a comparison. Also ensures we do not confuse a compare for a copy.\n- mhd_assert: Often implemented as a macro; macros can expand into code that may call other functions (potentially memcmp) or otherwise perform string comparisons. Inspect its definition for hidden memcmp usage.\n- MHD_get_master: The only callee of the target function. If it (or code it pulls in) calls memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, that would be an indirect violation relevant to the target function's behaviour; therefore its implementation must be checked.\n- gnutls_cipher_get and gnutls_protocol_get_version: Used under HTTPS_SUPPORT. These are external APIs called from the target function; their wrappers or any local inline/wrapper code could hide string comparisons or memcmp usage. Inspect their declarations/wrappers in this codebase (not the GnuTLS library internals) to rule out memcmp on strings.\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): Required to understand the types of members accessed (addr, addr_len, connection_info_dummy, tls_session, rq, rp, socket_fd, etc.). In particular, determine whether addr/client_addr are character buffers (null\u2011terminated strings) or binary socket address structures.\n- union MHD_ConnectionInfo (definition): Needed to know the types of the fields being written/returned (e.g. client_addr, cipher_algorithm, protocol). If fields are string types, use of memcmp would be relevant; if binary, it likely isn't.\n- connection->addr: The actual field copied via memcpy. Inspect its type/semantics to confirm it is not a null\u2011terminated string (e.g. struct sockaddr) so memcpy is appropriate and there is no memcmp used on a string instead.\n- connection->addr_len: Controls whether the code treats addr as present; also helps determine if addr is a length/byte buffer (binary) or a string (length of a string). If addr_len is used with string semantics elsewhere, that might indicate string handling.\n- connection->connection_info_dummy.client_addr: The destination of memcpy; its type/size must be known to ensure it is a binary address buffer, not a null\u2011terminated string that later might be compared via memcmp.\n\nWith these symbols/definitions you can conclusively determine whether any memcmp use exists in the target function (directly, via macros, or through called/wrapper functions) and whether any comparisons would be performed on null\u2011terminated strings, thus deciding compliance with the MISRA rule."
