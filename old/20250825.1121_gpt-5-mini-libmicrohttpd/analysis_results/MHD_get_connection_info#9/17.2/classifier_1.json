  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment calls an external GNUTLS function (gnutls_protocol_get_version) from within MHD_get_connection_info; there is no direct call to MHD_get_connection_info itself. This does not constitute direct or indirect self-call unless gnutls_protocol_get_version (or some function it calls) were to call MHD_get_connection_info back, which is not the case here. A violation would occur only if the called function chain eventually invoked MHD_get_connection_info (creating recursion)."
