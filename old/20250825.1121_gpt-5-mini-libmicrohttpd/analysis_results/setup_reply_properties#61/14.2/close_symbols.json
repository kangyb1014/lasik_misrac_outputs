Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To determine whether setup_reply_properties violates MISRA's for-loop well-formedness rule, we must inspect any for-loops executed as part of its execution. The target function itself has no for statements, but it calls other routines whose bodies (and their callees) might contain for loops. For each symbol:\n\n- keepalive_possible: Direct callee of setup_reply_properties. Its implementation must be inspected because any for loops in it contribute to the behaviour executed from setup_reply_properties; those loops must be checked for the three clauses, single loop counter, and that functions called inside the loop body do not introduce forbidden modifications.\n\n- is_reply_body_needed: Direct callee of setup_reply_properties. Same reason \u2014 any for loops in its body (or in functions it calls) must be examined for MISRA compliance because their execution is part of setup_reply_properties's behaviour.\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_token_ci: This is a callee of keepalive_possible (per the static call graph). It must be inspected because it may contain for loops (or call other functions with for loops) that contribute to the runtime behaviour invoked from setup_reply_properties.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT: A macro used in a conditional inside setup_reply_properties. Although likely a simple comparison, it could be a macro or inline function that expands into code containing loops; to be safe, its definition should be checked to ensure it does not introduce any for loops that would need MISRA analysis.\n\nOnly these symbols (the direct callees and their callees plus any macro that could hide loop code) are necessary to determine whether any for-loops reachable from setup_reply_properties violate the MISRA rule. Inspecting their definitions (and any further callees found there) will let the analyst confirm compliance."
