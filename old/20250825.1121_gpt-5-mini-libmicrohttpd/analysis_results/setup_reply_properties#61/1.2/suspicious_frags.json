  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided function. Specifically, the code does not contain any of the following extension constructs that would need investigation: __attribute__ (or compiler attribute syntax), __asm / asm (inline assembly), typeof, __builtin_* intrinsics, __extension__, __declspec, __stdcall / __cdecl calling convention keywords, GCC statement-expressions ({ ... ; ({ ...; })}), anonymous/unnamed structs or unions used as extensions, or other documented compiler-only keywords. The code uses standard C features only: pointer types, enum, bool (C99 <stdbool.h>), preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef), macros, and standard comments (including Doxygen-style /**<) \u2014 none of which are compiler language extensions per se. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this snippet."
