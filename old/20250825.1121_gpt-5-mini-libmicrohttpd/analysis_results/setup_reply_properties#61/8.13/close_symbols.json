  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer in setup_reply_properties should instead point to a const-qualified type (MISRA: pointer should point to const whenever possible) the analyser must know what is read and what is written, and the exact types/qualifiers involved. Each listed symbol is needed for that reasoning:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - Required to see which members are mutated by setup_reply_properties (e.g. c->keepalive, c->rp.props.*) and whether those members are themselves declared const in the type definition. Also to determine the type of c->rp.response (the pointee type of r) and c->rq.http_ver.\n\n- struct MHD_Response\n  - Required to determine whether r (alias to c->rp.response) is pointing to a mutable object or to data that is declared const. Also to inspect which fields are read (total_size, flags_auto, flags, upgrade_handler) and whether any of them could be modified here (or require non-const access).\n\n- definition of rp.props (the type of c->rp.props and its members send_reply_body, use_reply_body_headers, chunked, set)\n  - setup_reply_properties writes to these props members. To know whether the pointer-to-props (via connection) must allow mutation, the actual props member types and const-qualification are needed.\n\n- enum replyBodyUse and constants RP_BODY_NONE, RP_BODY_HEADERS_ONLY\n  - The function compares/use these enum values to decide control flow; the analyser needs to know these values and whether any conversion/side effect might require non-const access (mainly to check if r could remain const).\n\n- prototype of keepalive_possible\n  - This callee is invoked with c. To know whether it mutates the connection or the response object reachable via c (which would affect whether r must be non-const), the prototype and its constness of parameters and behavior must be known.\n\n- prototype of is_reply_body_needed\n  - Same as above: it is called with c and a response code; it may read or modify connection/response state. Its parameter types/const-qualification and behavior are needed to determine if r or c must be non-const.\n\n- macro MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT\n  - Used in control flow determining chunked usage. Knowing how this macro evaluates (and its operand type expectations) helps verify whether http_ver access requires writable or readonly access.\n\n- macro/constant MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN\n  - Used to compare r->total_size. Knowing its type and semantics is necessary to reason whether r->total_size is only read and could therefore be on a const object.\n\n- macro/constant MHD_RAF_HAS_TRANS_ENC_CHUNKED\n  - Used to inspect r->flags_auto. To decide if r can be const, we need to know flags_auto is a readable field and whether reading it requires non-const access.\n\n- macro/constant MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT and MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER\n  - Used in bitmask checks on r->flags; needed to determine whether flags is read-only in this function and thus could be on a const object.\n\n- macro/constant MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE\n  - Assigned to c->keepalive. The definition/type of keepalive and this constant are needed to know whether keepalive is a mutable field and thus c must be non-const.\n\n- definition/type of c->rq and rq.http_ver member\n  - setup_reply_properties reads c->rq.http_ver via the macro; the exact member type and whether it is mutable/const-qualified are required to reason about const qualification of the connection and its nested members.\n\n- definition/type of r->total_size, r->flags_auto, r->flags\n  - To decide if r can be a pointer-to-const, the analyser must confirm these members are only read (not written) here and that their types permit read-only access; this requires their declarations.\n\n- definition/type of r->upgrade_handler and build-time macro UPGRADE_SUPPORT\n  - The code asserts about r->upgrade_handler when UPGRADE_SUPPORT is enabled. Knowing the type of upgrade_handler and whether it is mutable/const affects whether r could be const in all build configurations.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyser determine which objects are actually mutated by the function and which are only read; only then can it decide whether pointers (particularly r) ought to point to const-qualified types without violating the code's semantics."
