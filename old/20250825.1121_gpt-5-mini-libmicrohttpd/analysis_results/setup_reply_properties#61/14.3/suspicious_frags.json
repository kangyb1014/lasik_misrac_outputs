  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and thus no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The rule targets invariant controlling expressions (typically loop conditions or selection conditions that are constant). In the provided function there are no iteration statements (for, while, do/while). All conditional (if/else) expressions depend on runtime values (fields of r or c, request/response codes, flags, or results of macros that test runtime values) rather than being compile-time constants. Examples: comparisons against r->total_size (a response field), checks of r->flags or r->flags_auto, evaluation of MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT(c->rq.http_ver), and the earlier computation of use_rp_body via is_reply_body_needed(rcode, connection) \u2014 all are dynamic. The #ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT only controls compilation of an assertion; the assertion expression itself depends on runtime data. Therefore there are no invariant controlling expressions to flag."
