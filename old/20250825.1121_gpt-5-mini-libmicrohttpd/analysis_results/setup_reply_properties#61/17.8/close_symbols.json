  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule that a function parameter (the pointer variable) must not be modified:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function parameter is of this type. Its definition (fields rp, rq, keepalive, etc.) is needed to confirm that accesses like c->rp, c->rq and assignments to c->keepalive modify the object pointed to (allowed) and that no field access is actually a macro that could reassign the pointer variable itself (forbidden).\n\n- struct MHD_Response: r is derived from c->rp.response; the Response layout (total_size, flags, flags_auto, upgrade_handler, etc.) is required to ensure those member accesses are simple object field reads/writes and not macros that could alter the pointer parameter.\n\n- mhd_assert: The macro/function could expand to code that uses or reassigns the parameter name; its definition is required to ensure the assertion does not modify the local parameter 'connection' or the alias 'c'.\n\n- keepalive_possible: Called with c and its return assigned to c->keepalive. The function prototype/definition shows it is an ordinary callee (it cannot change the caller's local pointer variable), but its signature and semantics are needed to confirm no unusual macro invocation hides an assignment to the parameter variable in this scope.\n\n- is_reply_body_needed: As with keepalive_possible, this callee is used to determine rp props. Its declaration/definition ensures no macro side-effect exists that would reassign the parameter variable in this function.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT: This macro is applied to c->rq.http_ver; its expansion must be inspected to ensure it only reads fields and does not perform assignment to the parameter or to the alias 'c'.\n\n- MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN: Constant used in comparisons with r->total_size; its definition is required to understand control flow but primarily to check no hidden side effects (e.g., weird macro) that could reassign the parameter.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_TRANS_ENC_CHUNKED: Flag/mask used with r->flags_auto. Its definition is needed to verify it is a constant mask and not a macro with side effects that could affect pointer variables.\n\n- MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT: Flag mask used with r->flags; inspect for being a simple constant macro (no side effects).\n\n- MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER: Flag mask used with r->flags; same reason.\n\n- MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE: Constant assigned to c->keepalive in one branch; its definition ensures this is a simple value and not a macro that alters the parameter variable.\n\n- RP_BODY_HEADERS_ONLY: Enumeration/constant used to set rp.props flags and in the UPGRADE_SUPPORT assertion; its definition is needed to confirm no macro side effects or hidden assignments.\n\n- RP_BODY_NONE: Enumeration/constant used in the UPGRADE_SUPPORT assertion; include to ensure the assertion expansion does not modify the parameter.\n\nNotes: The focus of the MISRA rule check is whether the pointer parameter variable 'connection' (or its alias 'c') is ever assigned to inside this function. The most likely sources of surprise would be macros (mhd_assert, MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT, flag/constant macros) or non-obvious field accessors defined as macros. Therefore definitions/expansions of the listed macros/types are required to be certain no assignment to the parameter variable occurs."
