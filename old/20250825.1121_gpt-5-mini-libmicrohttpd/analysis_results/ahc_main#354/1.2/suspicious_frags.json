  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided function. The code uses only standard C features: a file-local static function and a function-local static variable, casts to void to suppress unused-parameter warnings, string literal macros, enum return type, pointer comparisons and assignments through a void**, calls to standard library functions (strcmp, strlen, memcmp), and normal macro usage. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, nested functions, statement-expressions, asm, labels-as-values, or other nonstandard constructs. The comparison of &already_called_marker (an object pointer) with *req_cls (a void*) is permitted by standard C pointer semantics, and no implicit compiler-specific behavior is required. Therefore no fragments require investigation for use of language extensions under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
