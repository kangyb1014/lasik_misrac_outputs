  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the character-pointer parameters (url, method, version, upload_data) are already const-qualified; string-literal macros (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET/HEAD, SEC_AREA1_URL, SEC_AREA2_URL) are used only as read-only data with strcmp/memcmp, which accept const pointers; the size_t *upload_data_size is an API output/communication parameter (expected to be writable by the caller/library) so it cannot generally be made const; the connection pointer is part of the external MHD API and may represent a mutable object (so it is not safe to mark it const without checking the API contract). Therefore only the listed fragments are potential candidates to check whether pointer types could be const-qualified or whether the object pointed-to could/should be const."
