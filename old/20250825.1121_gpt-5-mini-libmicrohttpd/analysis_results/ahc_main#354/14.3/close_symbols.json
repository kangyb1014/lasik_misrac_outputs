  "explanation": "You need the following symbols (and behaviors) to decide whether any controlling expression in ahc_main is invariant under the MISRA rule:\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD: These are the string constants used in the strcmp() checks. To determine whether the controlling expressions involving strcmp(method, ...) are constant/invariant you must know the actual values (or that they are distinct string literals) and whether the incoming 'method' parameter can ever equal them. If the constants were identical to 'method' by construction, the controlling expression would be invariant.\n\n- SEC_AREA1_URL, SEC_AREA2_URL: These string constants are used with strlen() and memcmp() in the URL range checks. Their values and lengths are needed to decide whether the conditions (strlen(SEC_AREA?_URL) <= url_len) && memcmp(url, SEC_AREA?_URL, strlen(SEC_AREA?_URL)) == 0 can ever vary given the runtime 'url' input; if these constants made the comparisons always true/false the controlling expressions could be invariant.\n\n- semantics_of_req_cls (initial value and persistence across invocations of the ahc_main callback): The expression (&already_called_marker != *req_cls) is a controlling expression whose truth may depend on the initial value of *req_cls provided by the caller and whether *req_cls persists/changes across repeated invocations of the callback for the same request. To assess invariance you must know the MHD callback contract: is *req_cls initialized to NULL by the framework? Is its value preserved between repeated calls for the same request? Without that behavior you cannot conclude whether the comparison is invariant.\n\n- semantics_of_upload_data_size (how/when *upload_data_size can be non\u2011zero between/within invocations): The test (0 != *upload_data_size) is a controlling expression. Whether it is ever non\u2011zero (or always zero for GET/HEAD) depends on how the caller/framework manages upload_data_size across callback invocations. That runtime behavior is required to judge invariance.\n\n- semantics_of_method and url (they are external inputs provided by the caller/MHD library): Both strcmp and the URL tests depend on these parameters. You must treat them as external inputs whose possible values are determined by the environment (HTTP requests). To prove a controlling expression is not invariant you need to know whether 'method' and 'url' can vary at runtime; to prove invariance you would need evidence they are constant in this context.\n\nNote: Standard library functions used (strcmp, strlen, memcmp) are pure functions of their inputs; no additional symbols are required for their semantics beyond knowing the input values mentioned above. The static local already_called_marker itself is local and its address is constant, so no further symbol is needed to reason about its address uniqueness."
