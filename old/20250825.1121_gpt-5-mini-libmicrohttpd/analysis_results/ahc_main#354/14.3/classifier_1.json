  "scenario": "The controlling expression depends on the value pointed to by the parameter upload_data_size (i.e. *upload_data_size) which is provided by the caller and may vary between calls, so it is not an invariant. Therefore this use does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. (If, in some specific build/usage, *upload_data_size were guaranteed by program logic to be a constant here, that would be a violation unless it fell under the stated exceptions.)"
