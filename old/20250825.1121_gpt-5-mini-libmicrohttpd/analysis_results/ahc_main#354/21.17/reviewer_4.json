If 'method' is NULL or not NUL-terminated, strcmp will read beyond the bounds of the object referenced by 'method' (or dereference NULL), violating Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function ahc_main:\n#define MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET \"GET\"\n...\n#define MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD \"HEAD\"\n...\n#define SEC_AREA1_URL \"/secret_page/\"\n...\n#define SEC_AREA2_URL \"/super_secret_page/\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s scenario points out that strcmp(method, ...) will read through the bytes pointed to by method and will therefore cause out-of-bounds access (or a NULL dereference) if method is NULL or not NUL\u2011terminated. That is technically correct as a generic C-safety observation. However, MISRA Rule 21.17 forbids uses of string.h functions that can result in accesses beyond the bounds of the referenced objects unless such accesses are impossible because of a documented guarantee. In this code the parameters method and url are used as C strings without checks. Whether this is a MISRA violation depends on the calling contract: if the MHD callback API guarantees that method and url are non-NULL, valid, NUL\u2011terminated strings, then these calls do not violate Rule 21.17 and Agent A\u2019s report is not correct. If no such guarantee exists (or is not documented), then the code is indeed noncompliant because it does not ensure the pointer parameters are valid before calling strcmp/strlen/memcmp. In short: the code is only a violation when there is no caller/API guarantee of valid NUL\u2011terminated strings. If the surrounding MHD library guarantees those preconditions (as is normally the case for libmicrohttpd handlers), then the report is not correct. I therefore judge the report as not correct in the usual context of this API; if you cannot rely on that API guarantee, add explicit NULL/termination checks to be MISRA\u2011compliant."
