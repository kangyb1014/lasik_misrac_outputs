  "explanation": "All occurrences of functions from <string.h> in the provided function have been listed above (strcmp, strlen, memcmp). These are the only places where string/library memory access could potentially read beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters and therefore warrant inspection. The remaining code fragments do not call any of the <string.h> functions and do not perform memory reads/copies of character buffers that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17; for example, the (void) cast lines, the upload_data_size check, the req_cls/marker logic, return statements, and the macro definitions themselves are not relevant to this rule and thus need not be investigated for out-of-bounds string accesses."
