  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The three (void) parameter casts in ahc_main are deliberate no-op annotations to document/acknowledge unused parameters and to silence compiler diagnostics. MISRA C\u2019s Rule 2.2 prohibits dead code in the sense of executed operations that are unnecessary to the program\u2019s intended behaviour; in practice MISRA recognises the common idiom of casting an unused parameter to void as an explicit, acceptable way to indicate an intentionally unused parameter rather than accidental leftover code. The cast has no operational effect but serves as documentation and to control diagnostics; it is an accepted idiom and is not treated as a rule 2.2 violation. If the project policy forbids that idiom, the correct fix would be a project-level rule (or using an alternative such as omitting the parameter name in the function signature or using compiler attributes), not to treat these casts as dead code under MISRA 2.2."
