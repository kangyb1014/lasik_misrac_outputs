  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for dead\u2011code (MISRA) analysis of ahc_main:\n\n- SEC_AREA1_URL, SEC_AREA2_URL\n  - The code uses strlen(SEC_AREA?_URL) and memcmp(url, SEC_AREA?_URL, \u2026) to ch\u1ecdn the security area branch. Knowledge of these constants (their values and lengths) is required to determine whether those branch conditions can ever be true (or always false) and therefore whether the calls to handle_sec_areas_req (and subsequent reply_with_* calls) are potentially dead.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD\n  - The method check (strcmp against these symbols) controls early returns. Their values determine which requests take the GET/HEAD path. To prove that the method-check branch or the subsequent \"method not supported\" call is dead or live, the concrete values (or the contract that only certain literal strings are used) must be known.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO)\n  - The function returns these results; their semantics (particularly MHD_YES meaning \"wait for more data\" and MHD_NO meaning \"failure/close\") are needed to assess whether the assignment to *req_cls and the early return that uses MHD_YES are required for correct behaviour. If returning MHD_YES / setting *req_cls is required by the HTTP server library, then removing that code would change behaviour; if it is inert in the current usage, it could be dead.\n\n- MHD_AccessHandlerCallback callback contract / req_cls lifecycle (libmicrohttpd)\n  - The *req_cls logic is the main candidate for being dead code: the code stores &already_called_marker into *req_cls and checks it on subsequent invocations. To determine if that operation is dead, the exact lifecycle semantics of the access-handler callback provided by libmicrohttpd (how req_cls is initialized, preserved between invocations, and how the library reacts to return values and req_cls modifications) are required. This is not visible in ahc_main itself but is essential to decide whether setting/checking *req_cls affects program behaviour.\n\n- strcmp, strlen, memcmp (standard C string semantics)\n  - Although these are standard library functions with well\u2011known semantics, an explicit acknowledgement of their exact semantics (return conventions, when invoked with particular inputs, and that they have no side effects) is useful to conclude that the branch conditions are purely control-flow checks and do not have hidden side effects. This helps prove (or disprove) that their execution is removable without changing behaviour.\n\nNotes:\n- The four reply_/handle_* functions called by ahc_main are already present in the provided call graph; their effects (side effects on external state, responses sent to client) are clearly observable and thus not candidates for \"dead code\" unless it can be shown their calls are never reached. The additional symbols above are those needed to decide whether any of ahc_main's executed operations (notably the req_cls marker logic and the security-area branch tests) could be removed without changing program behaviour."
