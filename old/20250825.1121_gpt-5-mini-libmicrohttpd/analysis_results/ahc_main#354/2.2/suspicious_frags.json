Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other statements perform observable control-flow or data-dependent behaviour and thus are not candidates for dead-code removal: the method checks (strcmp) determine allowed HTTP methods and affect responses; the upload_data_size check returns MHD_NO for unexpected uploads; the req_cls/already_called_marker logic alters handshake/processing flow across invocations (timing/sequence-dependent) and cannot be removed without changing behaviour; the URL comparisons (strcmp/memcmp and strlen) select which page/handler to invoke and therefore affect runtime results; the final reply_with_page_not_found is the fallback response. Repeated strlen/memcmp calls, url_len usage and returns are functional and affect program behaviour, so they should not be treated as dead code."
