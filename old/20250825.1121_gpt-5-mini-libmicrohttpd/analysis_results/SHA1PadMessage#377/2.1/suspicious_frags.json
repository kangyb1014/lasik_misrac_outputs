  "explanation": "No code fragments in SHA1PadMessage are statically unreachable. The function\u2019s control flow depends on the runtime value of context->message_block_index, so both branches of the if (context->message_block_index > 55) statement are reachable depending on that value. The while loops are conditional on the value of message_block_index at runtime (and on any changes made by SHA1ProcessMessageBlock), so they are not provably dead code. The final sequence that writes message_block[56]..[63] and calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock always follows the earlier branches and is reachable. There are no return, break, goto, or constant-contradiction conditions that would make any of the shown statements impossible to execute.\n\nNote: although no unreachable code was found, there are other potential issues (for example, possible out-of-bounds indexing if message_block_index has an unexpected value or signedness-related concerns). Those are not instances of unreachable code (MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1) and therefore are not reported here."
