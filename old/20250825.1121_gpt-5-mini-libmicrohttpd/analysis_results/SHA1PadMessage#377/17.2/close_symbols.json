  "explanation": "- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: This is the direct callee of SHA1PadMessage. You must inspect its definition to confirm it does NOT call SHA1PadMessage (directly) or call other functions that eventually call SHA1PadMessage (indirect recursion).\n- SHA1Input: Listed as a caller of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock in the static graph. Inspect it to ensure there is no path from SHA1ProcessMessageBlock -> SHA1Input -> ... -> SHA1PadMessage (i.e., no indirect cycle through SHA1Input).\n- SHA1Result: This is a caller of SHA1PadMessage. While callers are not needed to prove SHA1PadMessage recurses, SHA1Result\u2019s body should be checked in case SHA1PadMessage (or any of its callees) is called back from code reachable from SHA1Result, forming an indirect cycle in the overall program call graph.\n- ws_get_accept_value: Caller of SHA1Result per the graph. Include it because recursion can be indirect via longer transitive chains; any function that can be reached from or can reach the callee chain must be examined to rule out indirect self-calls.\n\nNote: In addition to these symbols, you should also obtain the definitions of any further transitive callees reachable from SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (and any functions called by the listed symbols) to fully rule out indirect recursion. Also inspect usage of function pointers or callbacks in those functions, since they can create calling edges not visible in a simple static call list."
