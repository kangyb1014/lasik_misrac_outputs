  "explanation": "- struct SHA1Context (complete definition): SHA1PadMessage dereferences and writes fields of this struct (message_block, message_block_index, length_high, length_low). To decide whether any pointer inside the struct (or the struct pointer parameter itself) could/should be const-qualified you must see the actual member types and any existing const qualifiers. - SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (declaration and implementation): SHA1PadMessage calls this function; if that callee modifies the context (or requires a non-const pointer), the SHA1PadMessage parameter and/or struct members cannot be const. Both the prototype (to see parameter const-qualification) and the implementation (to see side-effects) are needed. - SHA1Result (declaration/implementation): SHA1Result is a caller of SHA1PadMessage. Its use shows how the context object is created/declared and whether it is intended to be modifiable or passed as const elsewhere; this affects whether const qualification is possible/consistent. - SHA1Input (declaration/implementation, if available): SHA1Input also calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock per the call graph; its behavior may show additional write/read patterns on SHA1Context members which influence whether members/pointers can be const. - typedefs / integer type definitions used by SHA1Context: to correctly interpret member types (sizes and signedness) and any platform typedefs that could affect const-qualification decisions, include the typedefs (e.g., UINT32, UINT8, unsigned long) used in the struct."
