  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code assigns to context->message_block[56], so the message_block object is being modified and therefore must not be const; Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified only when they need not allow modification. A violation would occur if a pointer/struct member that is not modified (e.g. a function that only reads the message block) were declared as a non-const pointer instead of const unsigned char *."
