  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1PadMessage:\n```c\nstatic void\nSHA1PadMessage (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  if (context->message_block_index > 55)\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n    while (context->message_block_index < 64)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n    SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n    while (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0x80;\n    while (context->message_block_index < 56)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  context->message_block[56] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 24);\n  context->message_block[57] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 16);\n  context->message_block[58] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high >> 8);\n  context->message_block[59] = (unsigned char) (context->length_high);\n  context->message_block[60] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 24);\n  context->message_block[61] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 16);\n  context->message_block[62] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low >> 8);\n  context->message_block[63] = (unsigned char) (context->length_low);\n  SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (context);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nwhile (context->message_block_index < 64)\n    {\n      context->message_block[context->message_block_index++] = 0;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The loop is executed when context->message_block_index > 55 to zero-fill the remainder of the 64-byte message block after inserting the 0x80 byte; those bytes are consumed by SHA1ProcessMessageBlock. Removing the loop would change the contents of the block passed to SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (and thus change the computed hash), so the operations are not dead code."
