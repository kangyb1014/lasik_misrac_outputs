  "explanation": "1) struct SHA1Context (full definition): The controlling expressions in the if and while statements use context->message_block_index and the code reads/writes context->message_block and length_high/length_low. To determine whether those controlling expressions are invariant you must know the exact declarations of these members (their types, signedness, volatile qualifier if any). For example, if message_block_index is declared volatile, const, or of a type with small width that wraps differently, that affects whether the condition can change and whether a static analyser may regard the expression as invariant.\n\n2) SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (function definition): SHA1PadMessage calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock between loops. That callee may modify context->message_block_index (or other context fields) which directly affects the loop conditions after the call. To decide if the controlling expressions are invariant (or potentially invariant across the call), the analyser must see the body/effects of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock.\n\n3) Declarations / typedefs of the integer types used in struct SHA1Context: The comparisons use numeric constants (55, 56, 64). The exact type and width of message_block_index (and length_high/length_low) determine promotion rules, overflow/wrap behaviour, and whether comparisons could be resolved as compile-time constants. MISRA's rule about invariant controlling expressions depends on whether the controlling expression can change at runtime; integer type details matter for that determination.\n\n4) Definition (type and size) of message_block: The code indexes message_block using message_block_index and assigns bytes. Knowing the array size is necessary to see whether the post-increment operations always make progress towards terminating the loops and whether any writes or index wrap/overflow semantics could render the controlling expression effectively invariant or cause undefined behaviour that affects loop termination.\n\nThese symbols give an analyser the necessary information to determine whether the controlling expressions (the if and the while conditions) can change during execution or are invariant (taking into account modifications inside the function and in the called function), which is required to assess conformance with the MISRA rule."
