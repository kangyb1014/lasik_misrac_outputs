  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions (if / while conditions) are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The fragments reported above contain the controlling expressions present in this function and should be investigated to determine whether those expressions can be invariant. Other code in the function (the assignments to context->message_block[56..63], the array stores, the post-increment side effects, and the call to SHA1ProcessMessageBlock) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3; they do not need separate investigation for this specific rule. The two while/if conditions shown are the only control expressions in the function and thus the only locations that could violate Rule 14.3."
