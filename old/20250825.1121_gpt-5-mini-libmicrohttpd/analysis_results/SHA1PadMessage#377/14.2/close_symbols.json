The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct SHA1Context: SHA1PadMessage reads and writes context->message_block_index, context->message_block, context->length_high and context->length_low. To determine whether any for-loop in this function or in called functions violates MISRA's for-loop clauses you must know the exact types (signed/unsigned, width) and declarations of these members (for example if message_block_index is an unsigned or signed type, or if message_block is an array vs pointer). The signedness and type widths affect whether loop counters are modified/used correctly and whether expressions in loop headers might have side effects or implicit conversions.\n\n2) SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (full implementation): SHA1PadMessage calls this function inside its loop/branch points. MISRA's rule treats the behaviour of a for-loop body as including any functions called within that statement; therefore any for-loops inside SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (or use of objects from the context as loop counters or control flags) must be inspected. The full function body is required to see if it contains for-loops, what their loop counters/control flags are, and whether those objects are modified by the caller (SHA1PadMessage) or by the callee body, which would violate the rule.\n\n3) Implementations of any functions called by SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: If SHA1ProcessMessageBlock calls other functions, those callees' bodies are also part of the behaviour of any for-loops they appear in. You need their implementations to ensure no for-loop in the call chain uses or modifies context members or other objects in a way that breaks the three-clause requirements (loop counters, control flags, side effects).\n\n4) File-scope/global objects, macros or typedefs referenced by SHA1PadMessage or SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: Named constants or typedefs can affect loop bounds, the interpretation of expressions in loop headers, and the types of loop counters (e.g. typedefs for integer widths). Any macros that expand to expressions with side effects or to loop control expressions must be known to conclude whether any for-loop clauses have persistent side effects or modify objects used in the loop body.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any for-loop (in SHA1PadMessage or in any function called from it) violates MISRA C's well-formed for-loop requirements: they let you see loop headers, the identity and types of loop counters/control flags, where and how those objects are modified, and whether called functions introduce side effects into loop clauses or bodies."
