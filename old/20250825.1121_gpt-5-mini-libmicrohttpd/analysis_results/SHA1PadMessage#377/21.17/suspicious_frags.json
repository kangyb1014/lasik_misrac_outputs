  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 applies specifically to use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, memmove, memcmp). The provided snippet contains no calls to any <string.h> functions. Therefore there are no direct uses of the standard string functions in this fragment that would need investigation under Rule 21.17. The remaining lines (control-flow constructs, bit-shift assignments to length_high/length_low, and simple scalar operations) do not invoke the <string.h> API and so are not relevant to this rule. If further review is required for potential out-of-bounds resulting from library string functions used elsewhere, the implementations of any called functions (e.g. SHA1ProcessMessageBlock) should be inspected for uses of <string.h> functions; otherwise the rest of the shown code does not involve string.h calls and need not be investigated for Rule 21.17."
