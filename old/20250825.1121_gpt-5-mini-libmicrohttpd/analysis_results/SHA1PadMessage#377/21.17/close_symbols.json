  "explanation": "For correct MISRA <string.h> bounds analysis you must see how the buffer and indexes are declared and how other functions manipulate them:\n\n- struct SHA1Context (full definition): needed to determine the declared size and types of message_block, message_block_index, length_high, and length_low. The padding code writes to context->message_block[0..63] and uses message_block_index; without the concrete array size and index type you cannot determine if those writes could be out-of-bounds.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (function implementation): SHA1PadMessage calls this routine after filling the block. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it relies on or modifies message_block_index, uses string.h functions on message_block, or makes other assumptions that could create out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- SHA1Input (function implementation): SHA1ProcessMessageBlock is also called from SHA1Input and SHA1Input likely updates message_block_index and length_high/low. To prove that message_block_index passed into SHA1PadMessage is always in a safe range (<= 64) you need to inspect SHA1Input's behavior and its checks/updates of message_block_index.\n\n- SHA1Result (function implementation): it is the caller of SHA1PadMessage (per call graph). Inspecting SHA1Result shows how/when SHA1PadMessage is invoked and what constraints are assumed on context before the call; SHA1Result itself may use string.h functions (e.g., memcpy) on context fields or output buffers that could be relevant for MISRA string function usage.\n\n- Any macros/constants for message block and length sizes (e.g., BLOCK_SIZE, 64, 56, SHA1_BLOCK_SIZE, SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE): the padding logic uses numeric literals (56, 64) which should match the defined block size constants. Confirming the actual macro values and any conditional compilation ensures the index arithmetic matches the declared buffer size.\n\nAdditionally, when you obtain the implementations above, identify any direct calls to standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memset, memmove, etc.) within those functions so you can inspect their call sites for correct length arguments and to ensure they do not cause accesses beyond object bounds."
