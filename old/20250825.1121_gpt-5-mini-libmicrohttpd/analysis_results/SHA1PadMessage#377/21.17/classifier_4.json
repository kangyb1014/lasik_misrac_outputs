  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the fragment performs a direct assignment and does not call any <string.h> functions. Rule 21.17 applies specifically to use of string handling functions (e.g. memcpy, strcpy). Note: if context->message_block actually refers to a buffer smaller than 64 bytes, the index 62 write would be out-of-bounds (a different safety issue), and if a <string.h> function were later used to write beyond that buffer it could violate Rule 21.17."
