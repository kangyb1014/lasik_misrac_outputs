  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragment contains only standard C constructs: a normal function definition with a pointer-to-struct parameter, array subscripting, post-increment in the index expression (valid standard C), while loops, hex integer literals, casts to unsigned char, right-shift operations, and ordinary function calls. There are no compiler-specific keywords or extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({: ;}), nested functions, label-as-value, inline assembler, or other documented compiler extensions. Therefore no fragments require investigation for Rule 1.2."
