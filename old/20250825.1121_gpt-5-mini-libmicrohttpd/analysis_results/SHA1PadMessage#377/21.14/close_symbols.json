  "explanation": "- struct SHA1Context (definition): SHA1PadMessage operates on fields of this struct (message_block, message_block_index, length_high/low). You must know the types of message_block and its element type (char vs unsigned char, pointer vs array) to decide whether any memcmp use would be comparing null-terminated strings rather than raw byte buffers.\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: a direct callee of SHA1PadMessage. If memcmp (or a string-comparison wrapper) is used inside this function on buffers derived from context->message_block or other context fields, that would be relevant to determining a MISRA memcmp-on-NT-string violation originating from the pad/processing sequence.\n- SHA1Result: direct caller of SHA1PadMessage. SHA1Result may perform comparisons (e.g. comparing computed digest output to a string or header) after padding; any memcmp use here that feeds or treats padded data as null-terminated strings must be inspected.\n- SHA1Input: shown in the static graph as another caller of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock. Include it because it may reveal patterns of how buffers produced/consumed by processing/padding are compared elsewhere, or whether memcmp is used elsewhere in the same processing path.\n- memcmp (library): the symbol and its usages must be located to determine whether it is being called on null-terminated C-strings. You need to find all memcmp call sites reachable from/related to the target to inspect the pointer arguments and length arguments.\n- strlen / strnlen / strcmp (string helpers): these common string-length/compare helpers are useful to detect patterns where code computes lengths for memcmp from string functions or uses strcmp (which should be used instead of memcmp for null-terminated strings). If memcmp length arguments are derived from strlen/strnlen, that indicates memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings and would violate the MISRA rule.\n\nCollecting these symbols and reviewing their implementations/call sites will allow determining whether any memcmp usage in the target or its immediate call graph compares null-terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
