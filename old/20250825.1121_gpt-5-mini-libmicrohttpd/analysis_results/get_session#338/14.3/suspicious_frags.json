  "explanation": "Other controlling constructs in the function do not require investigation for Rule 14.3 because they are not invariant controlling expressions: the various if statements (e.g. if (cookie != NULL), if (NULL != ret) after the loop, if (NULL == ret) after calloc) use values that are not compile-time constants and can change at runtime. The function contains no do-while loop or other loop headers that are constant/invariant (no while(1), for(;;), or constant conditional expressions). The ternary in the additional code ((NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen (key)) is not a loop/iteration controlling expression and is data-dependent. Therefore, apart from the while loop fragment reported above, there are no other obvious controlling expressions that appear invariant and need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
