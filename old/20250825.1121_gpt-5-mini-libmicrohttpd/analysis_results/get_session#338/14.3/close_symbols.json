  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol in assessing whether any controlling expression in get_session is invariant:\n\n- sessions\n  - The while loop controlling expression (NULL != ret) begins with ret = sessions. To decide if the loop condition can be invariant (always true or always false) you must know the value, lifetime and mutability of the global sessions variable and how/where it is modified.\n\n- struct Session (definition)\n  - You must know the layout and semantics of struct Session (especially the next member and its type) to reason about pointer-chasing in the loop and whether ret/ret->next can produce an invariant value (for example, a self\u2011loop causing ret to stay unchanged).\n\n- struct Session::next (member)\n  - The loop updates ret using ret = ret->next. To determine whether the controlling expression can be invariant you need the exact member name/type and whether next can legally point to the same object (create cycles) or be NULL.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value\n  - The if (cookie != NULL) controlling expression depends on the return value of this function. To decide if that condition is trivially invariant you need its specification (does it ever return a constant pointer, is it deterministic, can it fail, side effects?).\n\n- COOKIE_NAME and MHD_COOKIE_KIND\n  - These parameters influence MHD_lookup_connection_value behavior; their values or semantics may affect whether cookie can be invariant or always NULL/always non-NULL in the running system.\n\n- strcmp\n  - The loop contains strcmp(cookie, ret->sid) to possibly break out. Its semantics determine whether the loop can terminate (i.e., whether the controlling expression may become false because strcmp can match). Knowing its standard behavior is required to reason about termination of the search loop.\n\n- NULL (macro)\n  - The controlling expressions compare against NULL; the precise definition/representation of NULL in the target environment is required to reason formally about invariance.\n\n- calloc\n  - The function allocates a new Session and assigns ret. If allocation fails, the function returns early; allocation semantics determine whether later code that sets ret->next and sessions can create invariance. Also needed to reason about whether newly allocated ret can cause subsequent invariance.\n\n- fprintf, strerror, errno\n  - These symbols are involved in the allocation-failure path that returns from the function. To reason about any invariant controlling expression you must account for this early return path (i.e., the loop is not entered if allocation fails) and how error handling affects control flow.\n\n- snprintf, rand, time\n  - These functions initialize fields of the new session (sid, start) and do not affect the loop directly, but are needed to understand that newly created sessions are distinct objects (rand/snprintf produce unique-looking sid values and time gives a timestamp). This helps ruling out accidental invariance caused by reusing an identical session object or unintended aliasing.\n\nOverall rationale: The critical controlling expressions are the if (cookie != NULL) and while (NULL != ret) (and the subsequent if (NULL != ret)). To show these are not invariant you must inspect the source of cookie (MHD_lookup_connection_value + its parameters), the initial value and possible values of sessions, the structure of Session and its next member (to ensure ret changes across iterations and no guaranteed self-loop), and the behavior of strcmp (which can break the loop). The allocation and initialization functions (calloc, snprintf, rand, time) and error-handling symbols (fprintf, strerror, errno) must be considered to account for all control-flow paths that could make a controlling expression effectively invariant."
