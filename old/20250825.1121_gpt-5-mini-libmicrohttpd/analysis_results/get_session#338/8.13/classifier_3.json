  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The local pointer is declared as const char *cookie and is assigned the result of MHD_lookup_connection_value. This does not remove const-qualification, so the pointer points to a const-qualified type as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If the called function returned a non-const char *, assigning it to const char * only adds const and is safe; there is no evidence in this fragment of any later modification through a non-const pointer.)"
