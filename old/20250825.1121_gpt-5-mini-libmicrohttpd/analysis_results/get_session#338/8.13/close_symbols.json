  "explanation": "- struct Session (definition): needed to know the exact types of members used in get_session, in particular sid (is it char[] or const char[]?), next (struct Session * or const struct Session *?), and the types of rc/start. These determine whether pointers/arrays in the struct ought to be const.\n- sessions (global variable declaration): needed to see how the global is declared (struct Session * vs const struct Session *), and whether assigning to it (sessions = ret) is allowed or would conflict with const qualification.\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value (prototype/signature): essential to know the return type (const char * vs char *) so the assignment into cookie (declared const char *) is correct and to assess whether the callee should return a const-qualified pointer per the MISRA guideline.\n- COOKIE_NAME (declaration/type): to check whether this symbol is a const-qualified string (const char *) or not; it affects whether passing it to MHD_lookup_connection_value and any const-pointer expectations are satisfied.\n- struct MHD_Connection (type/definition): to verify whether the connection parameter passed into MHD_lookup_connection_value has any const qualification requirements in its declaration that would affect pointer constness in the lookup API.\n\n(Other standard-library prototypes such as strcmp/snprintf/calloc are standard and use const-qualified parameters where applicable; the above symbols are the ones that can change const-qualification decisions specific to this function and its API/struct usage.)"
