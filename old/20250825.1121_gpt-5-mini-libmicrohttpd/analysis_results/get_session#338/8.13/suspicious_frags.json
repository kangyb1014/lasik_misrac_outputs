  "explanation": "I flagged pointer declarations/usages that should be reviewed to determine whether they could or should point to const-qualified types: the function parameter (struct MHD_Connection *connection), the local session pointer (struct Session *ret) and the places where the global sessions pointer is read or updated (ret = sessions; ret->next = sessions; sessions = ret;). These are the code locations where pointer const-qualification might be applicable or where non-const pointers are being used/propagated.\n\nOther fragments were not flagged because they either already use const qualification (const char *cookie) or they intentionally modify the pointed-to object so const qualification would be inappropriate: the code writes into the session buffer (snprintf into ret->sid), increments/modifies session state (ret->rc++, ret->start = time(NULL)), and allocates/initializes a new session (calloc and subsequent assignments). The call to strcmp uses cookie (const) and ret->sid (a mutable buffer) appropriately; error reporting (fprintf, strerror) and the calloc check do not affect pointer constness. Therefore those fragments do not need to be investigated for Rule 8.13."
