  "explanation": "I found no uses of memcmp in the provided get_session code or the related snippets. The only string comparison is performed with strcmp (if (0 == strcmp (cookie, ret->sid))), which is the correct function to compare null-terminated C strings for this purpose. ret->sid is populated via snprintf, which guarantees a null terminator (so strcmp is appropriate). The helper MHD_lookup_connection_value uses strlen to compute a key length but does not call memcmp. Other operations (calloc, snprintf, rand, time, pointer NULL checks, linked-list traversal) are unrelated to Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for misuse of memcmp on null-terminated strings."
