  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed for MISRA analysis:\n\n- strcmp\n  - The target function uses strcmp(cookie, ret->sid) to compare strings. Provide its prototype/definition so the analyzer can confirm the code uses strcmp (a string comparison routine) rather than calling memcmp directly or via a macro alias.\n\n- memcmp\n  - The MISRA rule specifically prohibits use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The analyzer must confirm memcmp is not used directly in this function (or substituted in place of strcmp via a macro); providing memcmp's declaration/definition and any relevant macros helps detect forbidden use.\n\n- struct Session\n  - The layout of struct Session (field types and sizes) is required to know the type and storage of ret->sid and to ensure sid is intended/used as a null-terminated string field.\n\n- sessions (global)\n  - Declaration of the global sessions linked-list head is needed to understand how Session objects are stored/initialized and whether any invariants (e.g., sid contents) are established elsewhere.\n\n- ret->sid size (sizeof ret->sid)\n  - The exact size of sid (from struct Session) is needed to determine whether snprintf can null-terminate the generated ID and whether sid is safely treated as a NUL-terminated string for strcmp.\n\n- snprintf\n  - The code uses snprintf to populate ret->sid. The analyzer should confirm snprintf semantics (null-termination guarantee when size>0) and how truncation is handled so that ret->sid will be a proper NUL-terminated string.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value\n  - This function produces the cookie pointer. The analyzer must know its return semantics (whether it returns a pointer to a NUL-terminated string, whether it can return binary data or non-terminated buffers) to decide if cookie is a proper null-terminated C string suitable for strcmp.\n\n- MHD_COOKIE_KIND and COOKIE_NAME\n  - These symbols (macros/constants) identify the looked-up value. Knowing their definitions can help determine if the lookup returns a textual cookie value (NUL-terminated) or some other form; they also help locate the implementation/contract of MHD_lookup_connection_value in the codebase.\n\nProviding these symbols (declarations/definitions and relevant documentation/comments) lets the next analyzer determine (a) whether the code ever uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, and (b) whether the operands passed to strcmp are guaranteed to be NUL-terminated strings (so strcmp usage is appropriate and not a covert use of memcmp)."
