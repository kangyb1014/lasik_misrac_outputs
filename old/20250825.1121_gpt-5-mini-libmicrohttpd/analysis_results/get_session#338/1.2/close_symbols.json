  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule against language extensions we must know whether any of the identifiers used in get_session are implemented using compiler-specific or non\u2011standard extensions (attributes, gcc/clang builtins, zero\u2011length arrays, nonstandard linkage, etc.). Each listed symbol is required for that determination:\n\n- struct Session (full definition): to detect nonstandard constructs inside the struct (zero-length arrays, flexible/unnamed members, compiler attributes, anonymous structs/unions not allowed by MISRA or implemented as extensions) and to confirm types of its members.\n- sessions (global variable): to check its declaration for nonstandard linkage specifiers (e.g. __thread, __attribute__ visibility, or other compiler extensions) and to ensure its type matches struct Session * as expected.\n- struct Session.sid (member type and size): sizeof(ret->sid) is used; we must verify sid is not declared as a compiler-specific zero-length array or other nonstandard construct (which would indicate use of an extension).\n- MHD_Connection (type definition): to ensure the type is a standard C type and not defined via an extension or unusual compiler feature.\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value (declaration/prototype and any macro wrapper): this callsite must be inspected to see if the symbol is a macro or annotated with compiler attributes/extension (e.g. variadic macro, GCC attributes) that would constitute a language extension.\n- MHD_COOKIE_KIND (macro/constant) and COOKIE_NAME (macro/constant): their definitions must be checked to see if they expand to compiler\u2011specific constructs (attribute usage, inline assembly, unusual casting) or use nonstandard macros/extensions.\n- strcmp (declaration): ensure the identifier is the standard library function and not redefined with compiler-specific behavior or macros.\n- calloc (declaration): verify standard prototype and that it is not a macro/wrapper using extensions.\n- fprintf (declaration): same reason \u2014 may be macro-wrapped in some codebases.\n- stderr (object/macro): check whether stderr is standard or replaced by a thread-local or extension-provided symbol.\n- strerror (declaration): to ensure standard behavior and no extension-based redefinition.\n- errno (macro/object): errno can be implemented as a macro that expands to thread-local accessor; check whether that mechanism uses compiler extensions (e.g. __thread) that would be relevant to MISRA rule enforcement.\n- snprintf (declaration): to confirm standard definition and no extension-specific format behavior.\n- rand (declaration): to verify it is the standard function and not replaced by an extension.\n- time (declaration): same reason \u2014 check for nonstandard implementation or attributes.\n- NULL (macro): ensure NULL is the standard macro and not substituted by a compiler-specific construct.\n\nIn short: obtain the full declarations/definitions of the struct, globals, macros and all called/used library symbols so the next analyzer can determine whether any of them are implemented via compiler extensions (attributes, nonstandard language features or macros) that would cause get_session to violate the MISRA language\u2011extensions prohibition."
