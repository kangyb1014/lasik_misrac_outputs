  "explanation": "For determining whether any code in get_session is statically unreachable you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- sessions (global variable): The initial 'find existing session' branch iterates the sessions list. Whether that branch can ever execute (and whether the while/if bodies are reachable) depends on whether sessions can be non-NULL at runtime. The analyzer needs the declaration and any invariants/initialization of this global.\n\n- struct Session (full definition: fields sid, rc, start, next and sizes/types): The code reads/writes members (sid, rc, start, next) and uses sizeof(ret->sid) for snprintf. Knowledge of the struct layout and sid size is needed to ensure code that manipulates these fields is meaningful and not dead (for example if rc or next were macros/constants preventing useful updates). Also next is used to traverse the list; if next is defined in an unexpected way that makes the loop trivial, code reachability could change.\n\n- COOKIE_NAME (macro / constant): MHD_lookup_connection_value is called with COOKIE_NAME. If COOKIE_NAME is defined such that the lookup call is a no-op or always yields NULL (e.g., macro expansion to NULL or empty string by project configuration), the entire 'if (cookie != NULL) { ... }' branch could be unreachable. The symbol is needed to decide that.\n\n- MHD_COOKIE_KIND (macro / constant): Same reasoning as COOKIE_NAME: the kind argument affects lookup behavior. If MHD_COOKIE_KIND is defined to a value that MHD_lookup_connection_value ignores or treats specially, the cookie-check branch reachability may change.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value (declaration and implementation / contract) -- include MHD_lookup_connection_value_n if used internally: This is the callee that returns cookie. Its prototype and documented/actual behavior (can it ever return non-NULL for given connection/COOKIE_NAME/MHD_COOKIE_KIND? does it have side effects?) are essential to determine whether the 'cookie != NULL' branch is reachable at all. If the implementation (or a wrapper in the project) guarantees a constant return, parts of the function could be unreachable.\n\n- calloc (project allocation wrapper/semantics, if any override is used): The code tests if calloc returns NULL and has an error branch. If the project replaces calloc with an allocator that never returns NULL (e.g., aborts on failure), the 'if (NULL == ret)' branch would be unreachable. The analyzer must know whether the standard behavior applies or if there is a project-specific wrapper/assumption.\n\n- MHD_Connection (type definition / any invariants about connection values): The connection parameter and its invariants (e.g., always non-NULL in callers, or cookie subsystem disabled) can influence whether MHD_lookup_connection_value can return non-NULL. Knowing the connection type and guarantees from callers (create_response) helps determine branch reachability.\n\n(Notes: standard library functions used inside get_session such as strcmp, snprintf, rand, fprintf, strerror, time are usually assumed available and not to force compile-time unreachable code decisions. They only affect runtime behavior; include them only if the project overrides them with nonstandard semantics that could make branches unreachable.)"
