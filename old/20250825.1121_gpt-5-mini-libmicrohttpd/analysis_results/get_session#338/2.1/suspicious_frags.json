  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for unreachable (dead) code. There are no constant-true or constant-false conditions, no code that follows an unconditional jump/return in the same block, and no mutually exclusive preprocessor or compile-time constructs that would make any statements unreachable. Control paths are: (1) cookie != NULL and matching session found -> early return (intended); (2) cookie != NULL but no match or cookie == NULL -> allocate new session, with a NULL-check and return on failure; otherwise proceed to initialize and return the new session. All statements after their respective guards are reachable. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
