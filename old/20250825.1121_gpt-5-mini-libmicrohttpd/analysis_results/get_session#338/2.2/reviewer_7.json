In that case the operation is executed but its removal would not affect program behaviour, so it is dead code.

  "explanation": "The report is not proven by the supplied snippet. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead code across the whole project: an operation is dead only if its execution could be removed without affecting program behaviour. The single-function excerpt does show an assignment ret->start = time(NULL) that could be dead if the start field is never subsequently read (and if the call to time() has no relevant side effects). However, whether this is a violation depends on the rest of the project \u2014 e.g. subsequent reads of the Session.start field (timeout checks, logging, diagnostics), uses via other translation units, or observable side-effects of calling time() (errno changes, instrumentation) would mean the assignment is required. The evidence provided does not show that start is unused project-wide, so the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is not established. To decide definitively, search the project for any reads of the start field (or otherwise observable reliance on the time() call) and only then classify the assignment as dead code and a violation if no such uses exist."
