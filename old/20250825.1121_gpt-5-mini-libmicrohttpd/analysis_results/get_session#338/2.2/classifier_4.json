  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_session:\n```c\nstatic struct Session *\nget_session (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct Session *ret;\n  const char *cookie;\n\n  cookie = MHD_lookup_connection_value (connection,\n                                        MHD_COOKIE_KIND,\n                                        COOKIE_NAME);\n  if (cookie != NULL)\n  {\n    /* find existing session */\n    ret = sessions;\n    while (NULL != ret)\n    {\n      if (0 == strcmp (cookie, ret->sid))\n        break;\n      ret = ret->next;\n    }\n    if (NULL != ret)\n    {\n      ret->rc++;\n      return ret;\n    }\n  }\n  /* create fresh session */\n  ret = calloc (1, sizeof (struct Session));\n  if (NULL == ret)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"calloc error: %s\\n\", strerror (errno));\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  /* not a super-secure way to generate a random session ID,\n     but should do for a simple example... */\n  snprintf (ret->sid,\n            sizeof (ret->sid),\n            \"%X%X%X%X\",\n            (unsigned int) rand (),\n            (unsigned int) rand (),\n            (unsigned int) rand (),\n            (unsigned int) rand ());\n  ret->rc++;\n  ret->start = time (NULL);\n  ret->next = sessions;\n  sessions = ret;\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function get_session:\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_lookup_connection_value (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                             enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                             const char *key)\n{\n  const char *value;\n\n  value = NULL;\n  (void) MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                        kind,\n                                        key,\n                                        (NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen (key),\n                                        &value,\n                                        NULL);\n  return value;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nsnprintf (ret->sid,\n            sizeof (ret->sid),\n            \"%X%X%X%X\",\n            (unsigned int) rand (),\n            (unsigned int) rand (),\n            (unsigned int) rand (),\n            (unsigned int) rand ());\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The snprintf call is not dead: it writes the new session identifier (ret->sid) which is later used to match incoming cookies (see the strcmp earlier in get_session). Removing this snprintf would change program behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated. (A violation would occur only if ret->sid were never read anywhere \u2014 e.g. if cookie handling/session lookup were disabled so the SID is never used \u2014 then generating the SID would be dead code.)"
