  "explanation": "I have flagged operations that modify the newly allocated Session object (reference count increments, timestamp assignment, linkage into the sessions list), the session-id generation (snprintf with rand), the allocation and its immediate error handling, the cookie lookup call, and the session-list traversal as suspicious fragments to investigate for potential dead-code (i.e., executed operations that might have no effect on observable behaviour). Other parts of the code were not flagged because they represent essential control-flow or error-handling constructs whose removal would clearly change program behaviour: the if/while/strcmp logic that locates an existing session, the NULL checks that guard allocation and lookup results, the return statements, and the wrapper function structure in MHD_lookup_connection_value (initializing the out-parameter pointer, calling the lower-level lookup, and returning the result). These constructs are directly involved in decision making or in propagating error/lookup results and therefore are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2 as they affect observable behaviour (including timing and control flow)."
