  "scenario": "The fragment itself calls MHD_lookup_connection_value (not a <string.h> function), so the call by itself does not violate Rule 21.17. However a violation can occur later when strcmp(cookie, ret->sid) is used: if MHD_lookup_connection_value were to return a pointer to memory that is not a null-terminated string (or to a buffer shorter than expected), strcmp would read past the bounds of that object causing a Rule 21.17 violation."
