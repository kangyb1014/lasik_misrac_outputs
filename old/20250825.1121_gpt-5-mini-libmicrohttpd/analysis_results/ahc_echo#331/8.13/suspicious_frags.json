  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in this function do not appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 or otherwise warrant investigation for that rule:\n\n- The string parameters are already const-qualified: \"const char *url\", \"const char *method\", \"const char *version\", and \"const char *upload_data\".\n- Local pointers that refer to mutable objects (e.g. \"struct Request *req\", \"struct MHD_Response *response\") are used to allocate/modify or pass mutable data to APIs and therefore are not candidates for making their pointee types const.\n- The assignment \"evt.data.ptr = req;\" is an assignment into an epoll_event union member (not a pointer declaration) and does not indicate a missing const qualification on a pointee type in this snippet.\n- The itimerspec variable \"ts\" is a local object whose fields are written before being passed by address; the call sites use the API-defined signatures.\n\nGiven the above, the listed fragments are the places in this snippet where the pointer-to-pointee const qualification should be checked further (they are the only parameter/declared-pointer fragments here that could plausibly be const-qualified)."
