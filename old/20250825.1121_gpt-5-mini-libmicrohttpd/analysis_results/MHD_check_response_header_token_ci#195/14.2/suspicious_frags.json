First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (well-formed for loop): the initial parameter validation if ((NULL == key) || ('\\0' == key[0]) || (NULL == token) || ('\\0' == token[0])) return false; only checks inputs and does not affect loop formation. The mhd_assert (strlen (token) == token_len); is a runtime assertion and not part of loop formation. Simple returns (return false; return true;) outside the for header are not relevant to the rule. The individual comparisons inside the loop's if-condition that only read fields (pos->kind, pos->header_size, etc.) are not by themselves violations and therefore are not listed separately. The reason for selecting the declaration of pos and the entire for statement is that Rule 14.2 concerns the loop header (initialisation, condition, iteration) and any interactions between the loop clauses and the loop body (including called functions). Those items need inspection to ensure: a single loop counter is used, it is not modified in the body, the condition has no persistent side effects, and the iteration expression modifies only the loop counter and does not use objects modified in the body. No other fragments in the function affect these aspects, so they are not included for investigation."
