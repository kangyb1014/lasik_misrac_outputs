  "explanation": "For MISRA Rule 'no unreachable code' we must determine whether any statement in the function can never be executed or whether control-flow can be forced to never reach some points. Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: you must know how response->first_header is obtained/typed; if first_header is always NULL or otherwise constrained, the loop body may be unreachable.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: the loop and conditional read fields (kind, header_size, header, value, next). Their types and possible values are needed to decide whether the for-loop runs, terminates, or whether the if-condition inside can ever be true.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND: the value(s) and semantics of this constant are required to know whether (pos->kind == MHD_HEADER_KIND) can ever hold; if it never can, that branch (and return true inside it) would be unreachable.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: need the prototype, return type and exact semantics (including preconditions and side effects). If this function never returns, always returns false, aborts on invalid input, or has side effects that change control flow, it affects reachability of the return true path.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_: same reasons as above \u2014 its return behavior determines whether the combined condition can be satisfied and thus whether the return true is reachable.\n\n- mhd_assert: its definition is critical. If mhd_assert is implemented to abort, longjmp, or otherwise not return on failure, then the code after the assert could be unreachable for certain inputs; if it is a no-op in production builds, it does not affect reachability. MISRA analysis must know which.\n\n- strlen: standard semantics (non-null-terminated input UB, returns size_t) are relevant because the assert compares strlen(token) to token_len; if strlen has well-known behavior, that affects whether the assert can fail and thus whether control reaches the loop.\n\n- Invariants / construction contract for the header list: static analysis must know whether pos->next chains can form cycles or are guaranteed to terminate at NULL. A cyclic list would make the end-of-loop return false unreachable (infinite loop), whereas an acyclic list allows the function to return false after the loop.\n\n- Definitions of NULL and bool: to be explicit about types and constant values used in the initial null/empty checks (mostly standard, but needed for a complete static-proof environment).\n\nProviding these symbols/definitions lets the next agent reason precisely about whether any branch or statement in the function is statically or contextually unreachable (e.g., unreachable because an assert aborts, because the list cannot be non-empty, because MHD_HEADER_KIND never occurs, or because helper functions never return/always yield the same outcome)."
