According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type when possible (i.e. 'const char *header'), so the current 'char *header' declaration violates the rule unless other code legitimately modifies the pointed data.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_check_response_header_token_ci:\nstruct MHD_Response\n{\n\n  /**\n   * Head of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *first_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Tail of double-linked list of headers to send for the response.\n   */\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *last_header;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer pointing to data that we are supposed\n   * to send as a response.\n   */\n  const char *data;\n\n  /**\n   * Closure to give to the content reader @e crc\n   * and content reader free callback @e crfc.\n   */\n  void *crc_cls;\n\n  /**\n   * How do we get more data?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not demonstrably correct from the provided code alone. In MHD_check_response_header_token_ci the header and value members are only read (they are passed to comparison functions), so within this function they could be treated as const; however MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns the declarations of pointer types. The struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header declares header and value as char *; whether that violates 8.13 depends on whether any code in the whole code base ever modifies the pointed-to characters. If the pointed-to data is legitimately mutable somewhere (e.g. other functions write into header or value, or the API is designed to allow modification), keeping char * is appropriate. Also note that MHD_check_response_header_token_ci takes a pointer to a const struct, so it cannot modify those members through that parameter even if they are non-const in the struct definition.\n\nTherefore, with only the snippets shown, you cannot conclude there is a MISRA 8.13 violation. If an audit of the entire code base shows header/value are never modified, then the struct fields should be changed to const char * to comply with 8.13. Otherwise the current declaration may be justified."
