  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA R8.13 is about declarations: a pointer should be to const when it can be. Agent A points at the struct member char *value and notes that in MHD_check_response_header_token_ci it is only read, so it \u201ccould\u201d be const. That observation about this single use site is true, but it is not sufficient to conclude a MISRA violation. Whether the declaration of MHD_HTTP_Res_Header::value violates R8.13 depends on the whole code base: if any code (construction, modification, or deallocation helpers) writes through or otherwise needs a non-const char * for that member, then the non-const declaration is justified and not a violation. From the supplied snippets there is no evidence that value is never modified; in fact headers are likely created/owned/modified by other routines in the library, so making it const might be impossible or break the API. Therefore Agent A\u2019s report is not proven correct. To demonstrate a true R8.13 violation you must show that the member cannot possibly be modified anywhere (i.e., it is only ever read and could be changed to const in every translation unit), or show a static-analysis result across the whole project proving const qualification is possible."
