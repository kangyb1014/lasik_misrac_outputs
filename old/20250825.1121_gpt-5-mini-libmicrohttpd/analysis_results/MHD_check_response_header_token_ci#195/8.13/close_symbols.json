  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Response: needed to determine the exact type of response->first_header (is it a pointer to non-const or const-qualified header), which affects whether the function parameter 'const struct MHD_Response *response' and uses of its members comply with the rule.\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: required to inspect the types of its members (header, value, next, header_size, kind). In particular we must know whether header and value are declared as char * or const char *, and whether next is a pointer-to-struct (and whether it is const-qualified). Those types determine if the local pointer 'pos' and member pointers could/should be declared to point to const-qualified types.\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND: the definition/type of this constant/enum is required to understand the kind member's type (and whether any write access would prevent making related pointers const).\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (prototype): the function signature (parameter const-qualification) is needed to check whether passing pos->header and key (their declared pointer constness) is compatible and to determine whether the called API forces non-const pointer usage.\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (prototype): same rationale as above for pos->value and token: the prototype reveals whether the API requires non-const pointers, which would affect whether those member pointers or local pointers should be/need to be non-const.\n\n(These symbols provide the type and const-qualification information necessary to decide if pointer declarations in the target function could or should be changed to point to const-qualified types without breaking API/field compatibility.)"
