  "explanation": "For checking whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions/declarations of all externally referenced symbols that could themselves employ extensions (attributes, GCC/clang-specific keywords, statement-expressions, inline asm, nonstandard typedefs, flexible-array members, anonymous/unnamed structs/unions, etc.). Reason for each symbol:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: the type of the 'response' parameter. Its definition may contain language-extended constructs (flexible array members, anonymous structs/unions, compiler attributes) that would violate the rule.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: used inside the function (fields next, kind, header_size, header, value). Its declaration/definition must be examined for extensions (bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, anonymous members, attributes, nonstandard types).\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND: the macro/enum/value tested in the code. Its definition might be a macro that uses compiler extensions or attributes; must be checked.\n\n- mhd_assert: used as an assertion macro. Macros commonly hide compiler extensions (statement-expression ({ ... }), __extension__, __attribute__, or compiler-specific diagnostics). The macro expansion must be inspected.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (declaration/definition): an external helper called in the conditional. Its prototype or implementation may use non\u2011standard function attributes, calling conventions, inline asm, or other extensions \u2014 those must be checked.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (declaration/definition): same rationale as above; its declaration/implementation can contain extensions.\n\n- project definition of bool/true/false (e.g. <stdbool.h> or a local typedef/macro): the function uses bool/true/false. You must confirm they are standard C (stdbool.h/_Bool) and not a project-specific macro/typedef that uses an extension or hides compiler-specific behaviour.\n\n- declarations for size_t and NULL (e.g. <stddef.h>): while normally standard, these identifiers could be redefined in project headers or macros using extensions; include to confirm no extension usage.\n\n- declaration of strlen (e.g. <string.h>): the code calls strlen in the mhd_assert expression; the standard library declaration is usually fine, but if the project supplies its own implementation or wrapper it could use extensions/attributes \u2014 its declaration should be checked.\n\nInclude the above definitions/prototypes in the next agent's prompt so it can detect any use of compiler-specific extensions in those symbols which would cause the target function to violate the MISRA rule."
