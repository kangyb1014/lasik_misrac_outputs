  "explanation": "To determine whether any of the function parameters (response, key, key_len, token, token_len) are modified inside MHD_check_response_header_token_ci, the analyzer must see any symbols that could (a) assign to those parameter identifiers via macro expansion or (b) be implemented in a way that writes into the parameter variables. Explanations: \n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition): needed to confirm that accessing response->first_header is a member access and not a macro that could assign to the parameter variable 'response'. Also to verify whether any side-effecting accessor semantics exist.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (definition): required to see the exact fields (header_size, kind, header, value, next). If any of these member names are macros or accessors with side effects, that could modify local parameters; the struct definition rules out surprises and shows that pos and its members are regular fields (modifying the pointed object is allowed, but we must verify no assignments to the parameter variables occur).\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND (macro/enum): required to inspect whether this is a plain constant or a macro with side effects/assignments that might reference function parameter identifiers.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function definition): often implemented as a macro. A macro definition could expand into code that assigns to local identifiers (e.g., the parameter names) in non-obvious ways. The definition is needed to ensure it does not modify any of the function parameters.\n\n- strlen (declaration/definition or header include): typically a library function, but in some projects it may be macro-wrapped. We must confirm it is the usual non-modifying function and not a macro that could write to or rebind 'token' or 'token_len'.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (declaration/definition): this identifier is used in the conditional; it may be a function or a macro. If it is a macro it could contain assignments to identifiers in the caller scope (e.g., inadvertently assigning to 'key' or 'key_len'). The signature/definition is required to verify it does not modify any parameter variables.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (declaration/definition): same rationale as for the equality helper \u2014 need to confirm it is not a macro that assigns to the local parameter names or otherwise rebinds them.\n\n- prototypes/type of bool and size_t (headers): to confirm standard definitions (so they are not macros or redefinitions that could hide unexpected side-effects).\n\nIn short: obtain the definitions/declarations of all macros/functions used in expressions and the involved struct/type definitions to ensure none of them expand into code that assigns to the function parameters themselves (the MISRA rule violation to detect)."
