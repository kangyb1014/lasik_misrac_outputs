  "explanation": "No function parameters are modified in this function. All pointer parameters (response, key, token) are declared const, and there are no assignments that reassign any parameter (no occurrences of response = ..., key = ..., token = ..., key_len = ..., token_len = ...). Indexing (key[0], token[0]) and calls that pass the pointers (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, MHD_str_has_token_caseless_) are read-only uses here; the local variable pos is assigned and iterated, but it is not a function parameter. The mhd_assert reads token and token_len but does not modify them. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
