  "explanation": "The only code that appears to be inert / removable without changing program behaviour is the assertion and its definition. The mhd_assert macro expands to a no-op, so the call mhd_assert(strlen(token) == token_len) is not evaluated or executed \u2014 the strlen() check and its intent are effectively dead and should be investigated (it documents a runtime requirement that is not enforced). No other statements in the shown functions are dead code: the null/empty checks at the start of MHD_check_response_header_token_ci are active runtime guards; the loops and conditional returns in MHD_check_response_header_token_ci, MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, and MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ affect control flow and return values and therefore cannot be removed without changing behaviour. Helper functions and variables shown are used in active comparisons/iterations, so they are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2."
