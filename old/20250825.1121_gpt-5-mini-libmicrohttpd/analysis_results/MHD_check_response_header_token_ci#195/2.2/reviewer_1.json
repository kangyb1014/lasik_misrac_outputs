  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In the provided project mhd_assert is defined as #define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0). The source statement mhd_assert(strlen(token) == token_len); therefore expands to ((void)0); \u2014 an expression statement with no effect. The strlen(...) argument is not evaluated because macro arguments are only substituted into the expansion; it is not executed in the expanded code. Removing that no-op statement would not change the program behaviour (aside from any micro timing differences), so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note the caveat that if mhd_assert is defined to perform a runtime check in some build configurations, then in those configurations the call would not be dead; but for the project as given (mhd_assert as ((void)0)) the report of a Rule 2.2 violation is correct."
