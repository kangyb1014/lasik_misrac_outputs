Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for a dead\u2011code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: must know its prototype and semantics (pure function vs side effects). If it mutates memory or has observable side effects, removing the call would change behaviour; if pure, the call might be removable.\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_: same as above \u2014 the loop returns based on its result. Its side effects (if any) affect whether the function has observable effects and therefore whether any operations are dead.\n\n- mhd_assert: assertions are often compiled out in non\u2011debug builds. You must inspect its definition/expansion to know whether the assert has runtime side effects (logging, abort, memory reads) whose removal would change behaviour; if it expands to nothing then that operation might be dead in some builds.\n\n- strlen: included because it is used inside mhd_assert. Even though standard strlen has no side effects, the analysis must confirm that no unusual replacement/override exists in the project that would give it side effects.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition): you need the definition to know the type and volatility/const qualifiers of first_header and whether reading it can have side effects (volatile), and to determine whether traversing the list is observable.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (definition): required to know field types (kind, header_size, header, value, next), whether any fields are volatile, whether reading them may invoke accessors, or whether pointer aliasing could make reads observable.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND (enum/define): to determine the semantics of the comparison (pos->kind == MHD_HEADER_KIND) and whether that branch is ever true \u2014 relevant to reachability of the return true path and whether parts of the loop are dead.\n\n- All callers of MHD_check_response_header_token_ci (from the static call graph): dead\u2011code determination at project level requires knowing every call site. If there are no callers (and no export/registration), the whole function is dead.\n\n- Function-pointer tables / symbol-export lists that may reference MHD_check_response_header_token_ci: the function could be reachable indirectly via pointers/registration; these symbols must be checked to decide reachability and therefore whether the function (or parts of it) is dead.\n\n(These items let an analyst determine both internal dead operations \u2014 e.g. calls that have no effect \u2014 and external deadness \u2014 whether the function is ever reachable from the rest of the project.)"
