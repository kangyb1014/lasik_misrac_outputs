  "explanation": "To decide whether MHD_check_response_header_token_ci violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect the functions and data it relies on and any place memcmp (or similar) might be used on NUL-terminated data:\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: This helper is called to compare the header name against key. You must see its implementation/prototype to know whether it calls memcmp (or another binary compare) and whether it treats its inputs as NUL-terminated strings (which would make using memcmp a MISRA violation) or as length-bounded binary buffers (permissible).\n\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_: This helper checks for a token in the header value. Inspecting its implementation is required to determine whether it uses memcmp (or other library functions that internally use memcmp) to compare NUL-terminated substrings (potential MISRA violation) or performs length-bounded comparisons using the provided token_len.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: The fields (header, header_size, value, kind, next) and their types/semantics must be known. In particular, you must know whether header and value are NUL-terminated C strings or raw buffers and whether header_size is a string length or buffer length; this affects whether any memcmp use in helpers is comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The layout (at least the first_header field) is required to confirm the header linked-list traversal and understand the origin/types of header/value fields passed into the helper functions.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND: Required to understand the conditional that filters which headers get compared; not directly about memcmp but necessary to see what data paths lead to the helper calls being exercised.\n\n- memcmp: The concrete declaration/implementation (or knowledge that it is called) is required to identify direct violations. If any helper calls memcmp on NUL-terminated strings, that is a MISRA violation.\n\n- strncasecmp / strcasecmp / strstr: Common standard functions that helpers might call instead of memcmp. You must check whether helpers call these or call a wrapper that eventually uses memcmp on NUL-terminated strings. Including these symbols ensures you can detect indirect memcmp usage or other forbidden comparisons.\n\n- strlen: The target calls strlen(token) in an assertion; include it to confirm that token is expected to be NUL-terminated and that token_len equals the string length. That fact can influence whether subsequent comparisons are length-bounded or treat inputs as NUL-terminated strings (relevant to determining MISRA compliance).\n\nIn short: inspect the two helper functions and the header/response types (and any library routines they call, notably memcmp and common string functions) to determine whether any memcmp usage compares NUL-terminated strings."
