This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Response: needed to know the exact type of response->first_header (pointer validity, ownership and lifetime) and whether first_header can be NULL or points into buffers that impose bounds on header/value strings.\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: required to know the types and semantics of fields accessed (pos->next, pos->kind, pos->header_size, pos->header, pos->value). In particular we must know whether header and value are NUL-terminated, their allocated sizes, and whether header_size represents the actual object length or some other value.\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND: the constant/enum used in the comparison. Needed to determine which list entries are selected and therefore what invariants apply to header/header_size/value for those entries.\n- mhd_assert: definition/semantics (macro or function) to know whether the strlen(token) == token_len check is enforced at run-time in production builds or only in debug builds. If the assert can be compiled out, the call to strlen(token) may be omitted or may still be UB if token buffer length is less than token_len; analysis must know whether the runtime check is guaranteed.\n- strlen (from <string.h>): the standard behaviour is central to the MISRA rule. We must examine the exact argument passed (token) and the guarantee that the object token points to is NUL-terminated and long enough so strlen will not read past its bounds.\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: prototype and implementation are required to determine what memory/string operations it performs on pos->header and key (for example whether it bounds access by header_size/key_len or calls strlen/memcmp without length checks). This directly affects whether any string.h functions are used that could read past buffers.\n- MHD_str_has_token_caseless_: prototype and implementation are required to determine whether it calls any string.h functions (strlen, strchr, memcmp, etc.) on pos->value or token and whether it respects token_len bounds or assumes NUL-termination.\n- memcmp: often used by binary/length-limited comparisons. If any helper uses memcmp, its use must be checked to ensure length arguments do not exceed the actual object sizes; include to inspect its usages.\n- strncasecmp (or platform equivalent): case-insensitive comparison helpers commonly call strncasecmp/strcasecmp variants. If used inside the helpers, their length semantics must be inspected for bounds safety.\n- strchr: token-search helpers often use strchr/strstr/strcspn etc.; if MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ uses strchr (or similar), we must inspect those calls to ensure they do not overrun non-NUL-terminated buffers.\n\nIn short: the struct definitions and the two MHD helper functions (plus mhd_assert and the standard string functions they call) are necessary to decide whether any string.h calls in this call chain can access memory beyond the bounds of the referenced objects, which is what the MISRA rule requires checking."
