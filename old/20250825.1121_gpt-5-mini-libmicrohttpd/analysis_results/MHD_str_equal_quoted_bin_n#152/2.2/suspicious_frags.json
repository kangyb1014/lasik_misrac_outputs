  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function have been examined and are not considered suspicious for dead code: the function signature and return type are required; the local declarations (size_t i; size_t j;) are used; the initialization j = 0 is used before the loop; the final \"return true;\" is the observable successful outcome and is reachable; comments are non-executable. There are no unreachable labels or statements following unconditional returns other than those listed. The fragments reported above are the control-flow and early-exit points where removal or redundancy could possibly not affect observable behaviour (or where execution may be bypassed); therefore they should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C Rule 2.2. No other lines appear to be dead code."
