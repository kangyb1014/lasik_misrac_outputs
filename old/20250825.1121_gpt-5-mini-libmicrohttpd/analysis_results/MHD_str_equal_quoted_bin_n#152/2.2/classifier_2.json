  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (const char *quoted,\n                            size_t quoted_len,\n                            const char *unquoted,\n                            size_t unquoted_len)\n{\n  size_t i;\n  size_t j;\n  if (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2)\n    return false;\n\n  j = 0;\n  for (i = 0; quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j; ++i, ++j)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[i])\n    {\n      i++; /* Advance to the next character */\n      if (quoted_len == i)\n        return false; /* No character after escaping backslash */\n    }\n    if (quoted[i] != unquoted[j])\n      return false; /* Different characters */\n  }\n  if ((quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j))\n    return false; /* The strings have different length */\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2)\n    return false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The initial length check is redundant: removing it does not change program behaviour because the subsequent loop and final length comparison already detect any size mismatch and return false. For example, with quoted_len = 4 and unquoted_len = 1 the if (1 < 4/2) returns false early; if the if is removed the for-loop will terminate when j reaches unquoted_len and the final check (quoted_len != i || unquoted_len != j) will also return false. Thus the executed return false is removable without affecting behaviour, so this constitutes dead code."
