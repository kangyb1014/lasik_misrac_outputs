  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect self-calls you must examine not only the function body (which contains no direct calls) but the call relationships in the program. Each listed symbol/category is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- Direct callers of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n: recursion can be detected only by knowing which functions call this function directly (a direct caller could be the function itself).\n\n- Transitive callers (callers of callers, recursively): indirect recursion occurs when a chain of calls eventually returns to the target; therefore you must traverse callers recursively to detect cycles that include the target.\n\n- Direct callees of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (if any): although the provided body shows no calls, if any callees exist (e.g. via macros or future edits) they must be examined for paths back to the target.\n\n- All function-pointer objects that can be assigned the address of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n: indirect recursion can occur through function pointers; you need the symbols for variables/tables that may hold the target\u2019s address and all assignments that populate them.\n\n- All call sites that invoke MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n via function pointers or indirect calls: these sites are equivalent to direct calls for cycle detection and must be included in the call graph.\n\n- Any wrapper/alias functions or macros that forward to MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n: aliases can hide calls and create cycles; macro expansions and thin wrapper functions must be treated as calls to the target.\n\n- Definitions of file- or link\u2011scope static functions in the same and other translation units that appear in the transitive call graph involving MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n: static (internal) functions and cross-translation-unit functions may form part of a recursion cycle; their definitions are required to follow call chains completely.\n\n- The program-wide call graph edges involving MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (both incoming and outgoing): a complete set of incoming/outgoing edges is needed to perform a graph cycle detection (reachability) to conclude whether the target is (directly or indirectly) recursive.\n\nProvide the actual symbol names/definitions for the above categories (the concrete caller and callee function names, function-pointer variables, wrapper functions, macro definitions, and the call-graph edges) so the next agent can perform a concrete cycle-detection analysis."
