  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided snippets calls MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (or any other function) either directly or indirectly. The function body contains only local variables, comparisons, increments and returns; there are no function calls, no function-pointer invocations, no macros that expand to calls, and no references to other functions that could produce indirect recursion. The repeated identical definitions in the additional code are duplicates of the same non-calling implementation and do not call each other. Therefore, based on the supplied code fragments, there is no evidence of direct or indirect self-calls to investigate for Rule 17.2. If there are other files or unseen code that reference this function (calls or function-pointer usage), those should be examined, but they are not present in the supplied fragments."
