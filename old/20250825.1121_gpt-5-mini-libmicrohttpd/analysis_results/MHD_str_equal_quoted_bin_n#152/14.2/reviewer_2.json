First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

This modifies a loop counter within the body, violating Rule 14.2 (the loop counter shall not be modified in the for-loop body; also only one loop counter is allowed).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n:\nsize_t i\n...\nsize_t j\n...\nsize_t quoted_len\n...\nsize_t unquoted_len\n...\nconst char *quoted\n...\nconst char *unquoted\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The for statement here violates Rule 14.2 in multiple ways: (1) The loop uses two loop counters (++i, ++j) in the iteration expression, but Rule 14.2 requires there be only one loop counter. (2) The loop body modifies i (i++), which is a loop counter \u2014 the rule forbids modifying the loop counter in the for-loop body. (3) The third clause ( ++i, ++j ) uses an object (i) that is also modified in the loop body, which contradicts the requirements for the third clause. Any of these points is sufficient to conclude the for loop is not well-formed per MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
