The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- i: local loop counter used in all three for-clauses and also explicitly modified inside the loop body (i++ inside the if). Required to decide whether the loop counter is being modified in the body (MISRA violation).\\n- j: second loop counter (incremented in the third clause). Needed to determine the loop counters present and whether j is initialized and modified only by the third clause or elsewhere in the body.\\n- quoted_len: used in the second clause of the for-condition. Required to check whether the second-clause uses objects other than the loop counter and/or a boolean control flag and to verify quoted_len is not modified in the loop body.\\n- unquoted_len: same reason as quoted_len \u2014 it appears in the second clause and must not be an object modified inside the loop body.\\n- quoted: the array/indexed object read inside the loop body (quoted[i]). Included to ensure accesses or any potential modifications (or function calls affecting it) do not count as forbidden side effects.\\n- unquoted: the array/indexed object read inside the loop body (unquoted[j]). Included for the same reason as quoted.\\n- size_t: type of i, j, quoted_len, unquoted_len. Needed to determine whether loop counters are integral (and to confirm they are not Boolean loop control flags).\\n- bool: required to identify what qualifies as a boolean loop control flag under the rule.\\n- true, false: boolean constants used by the function (return values). Included to allow a correct classification of boolean objects/constants when checking for loop control flags.\\n\nThese symbols (their declarations/types and the fact that no other functions are called that could modify them) are sufficient to determine if the for loop obeys the MISRA requirement: there is a single loop counter, the second clause uses only allowed objects, and the third clause modifies only the loop counter(s). In this function the critical facts to check are that i and j are the loop counters, that j is initialized before the loop, and that i is additionally modified inside the loop body (which would violate the rule)."
