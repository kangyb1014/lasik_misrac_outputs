  "explanation": "No loop or selection controlling expression in this function is invariant. Reasoning by construct:\n- for loop: for (i = 0; quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j; ++i, ++j)\n  - The condition depends on i and j, both of which are modified by the loop header (and i can also be modified inside the body). Hence the controlling expression is not invariant and does not violate Rule 14.3.\n- if (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2)\n  - This is a single-evaluation selection, not an iteration. Rule 14.3 targets invariant controlling expressions that would produce non-terminating or meaningless loops; a single if evaluated once with parameter values is not an invariant loop condition.\n- Inner conditionals inside the loop (if ('\\\\' == quoted[i]) and if (quoted_len == i) and if (quoted[i] != unquoted[j]))\n  - These depend on runtime data (array contents and index variables) or on i which is changing; they are not invariant.\n- Final check if ((quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j))\n  - Also a single evaluation after the loop; not an invariant loop condition.\nNo do/while or while loops with constant controlling expressions or any other invariant controlling expressions were found, and no exception cases (allowed infinite loops or the permitted do-while constant-false pattern) apply. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
