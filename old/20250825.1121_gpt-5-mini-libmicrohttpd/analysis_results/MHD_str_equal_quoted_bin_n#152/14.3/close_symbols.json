  "explanation": "size_t: The loop and conditional use size_t operands. You must know that size_t is an unsigned integer type (range, wrapping behavior) to reason about comparisons (quoted_len > i), the division (quoted_len / 2) and potential wrap-around of i and j when incremented. bool: The function returns bool and the MISRA rule concerns boolean/controlling expressions; knowing the C boolean type/semantics (_Bool / stdbool.h) clarifies how conditional results are interpreted. quoted_len: This parameter appears directly in the controlling expressions (quoted_len / 2, quoted_len > i and quoted_len == i). Its value and range determine whether those expressions can be invariant at run-time. unquoted_len: This parameter appears in the controlling expressions (unquoted_len < ..., unquoted_len > j and unquoted_len == j). Its value and range likewise affect invariance. SIZE_MAX: The maximum value for size_t is needed to reason about possible unsigned wrap-around of i or j (incrementing beyond the type maximum) and whether that could produce an invariant controlling expression."
