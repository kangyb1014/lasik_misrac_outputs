  "explanation": "To decide if the function uses compiler language extensions (MISRA rule about language extensions), the analyzer must know how the Boolean and size types are defined and which language standard is in effect: \n\n- bool / true / false: These identifiers may be macros from <stdbool.h>, a user typedef, or compiler-provided extensions. Knowing their definitions is necessary to determine whether the code relies on a nonstandard/extension Boolean name.\n\n- _Bool: The builtin C99 boolean type. If bool maps to this, the code uses standard C; if not, it may be an extension. The analyzer must check for _Bool usage/availability.\n\n- size_t: This type is normally defined in the standard headers (e.g., <stddef.h>). If size_t comes from a standard header, it is not an extension; if it is defined otherwise, it could indicate an extension. The analyzer must see the actual definition.\n\n- stddef.h: Presence/contents confirm the standard definition of size_t. The analyzer should check whether the code includes or relies on this standard header.\n\n- stdbool.h: Presence/contents confirm the standard definition of bool/true/false. The analyzer should check whether the code includes or relies on this standard header.\n\n- __STDC_VERSION__: The value of this macro indicates the C language standard supported by the compiler (e.g., C89, C99). This determines whether features like _Bool/stdbool.h are standard or whether their use would be an extension under the configured standard.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next agent determine whether the boolean and size types used in the function are standard C constructs or compiler/Project-specific extensions, and thus whether the function violates the MISRA restriction on language extensions."
