  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns accesses beyond object bounds for string handling. Although this function does not call any <string.h> routines, it performs manual indexed accesses into the quoted and unquoted buffers and adjusts the index variable i inside the loop. The listed fragments are the only locations where buffer lengths and indexing interact and therefore are the code areas that must be investigated for potential out-of-bounds accesses (loop condition, manual increment of i, comparisons against quoted_len/unquoted_len, and the initial length check). Other parts of the function (function signature, local variable declarations, final return true, comments) do not perform buffer accesses or call string.h functions and so do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
