  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can cause or rely on out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses from string.h usage you must examine not only the function body (which indexes quoted[i] and unquoted[j] using the passed lengths) but also the provenance and actual sizes of the objects and the code that computes those lengths. Specifically:\n\n- Call sites of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n: you need to inspect every place this function is invoked to see what buffers and lengths are passed in (a safe/unsafe use may only appear at a particular caller).\n\n- The object definitions for quoted/unquoted: the actual object bounds (statically sized arrays, struct fields or heap allocations) determine whether the indexes i and j can legally access quoted[i] / unquoted[j] up to the provided lengths. Without the object declarations you cannot tell if quoted_len/unquoted_len exceed the real buffer sizes.\n\n- The expressions/variables used for quoted_len/unquoted_len: these may be derived from strlen/strnlen or other calculations. If quoted_len or unquoted_len are computed incorrectly (e.g. using strlen on non\u2011NUL-terminated binary data) or truncated/sliced, the function could read past the underlying object even though it checks the passed lengths.\n\n- Allocation/resizing functions: if buffers are allocated or reallocated before the call, you must check the requested/returned sizes to ensure the passed lengths do not exceed the allocated objects.\n\n- Writers that populate the buffers and their use of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, snprintf, etc.): prior out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes to the buffers could already have violated the MISRA rule. Also misuse of these functions when filling quoted/unquoted (wrong length arguments) is a primary source of buffer-size mismatches.\n\n- Macros/constants for buffer sizes: callers may pass constants or computed sizes; you must check those definitions to validate bounds.\n\n- size_t and bool definitions: the meaning and width of size_t affect comparisons and overflow behavior; bool definition ensures consistent interpretation of return values (minor but required for full analysis).\n\nOnly after inspecting these symbols (callers, buffer objects, length computations, allocation and write sites, and relevant macros/types) can you conclude whether any uses of string.h in the surrounding code can cause accesses beyond the bounds of the referenced objects and thereby violate the stated MISRA C rule."
