  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code fragment does not call any <string.h> functions. The increment of i when a backslash is seen could make i == quoted_len, but the immediate check if (quoted_len == i) return false prevents the subsequent access quoted[i] from running out-of-bounds. The loop condition (quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j) also ensures indices start in-range. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated."
