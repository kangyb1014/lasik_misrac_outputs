  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment only compares the loop indices (i and j) against the supplied lengths (quoted_len and unquoted_len) and returns false if they differ. It does not use any <string.h> functions (memcpy/strcpy/etc.), nor does it perform any pointer dereference in this fragment that could access beyond object bounds. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is not violated here."
