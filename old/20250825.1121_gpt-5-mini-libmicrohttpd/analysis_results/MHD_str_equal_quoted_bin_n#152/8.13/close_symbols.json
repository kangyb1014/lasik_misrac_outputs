  "explanation": "1) MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (header prototype/declaration): confirm the externally visible declaration matches the implementation's const qualifiers. MISRA checks must consider the public prototype (not just the implementation) to ensure parameters are declared const wherever possible.\n\n2) All call sites (functions that call MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n): to decide whether the function's pointer parameters could/should be const we must examine how it is used. If callers pass non-const pointers or perform casts, that affects whether changing or enforcing const would be permissible or would break existing usage (and may reveal violations where const is being discarded).\n\n3) Any call-site casts or helper macros that remove const qualification when calling MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n: explicit casts that strip const (or macros that do so) are direct evidence of const-qualification violations or workarounds; they must be inspected to determine whether the function's parameters are correctly const-qualified or whether callers incorrectly drop const.\n\n4) Definition of bool: the exact typedef/definition is required for precise type checking in the analysis environment; although it does not affect pointer constness, the analyzer needs the symbol to type-check the function signature and ensure the translation-unit-level declarations match project-wide definitions.\n\n5) Definition of size_t: similarly required to type-check local variables and the function signature; different definitions or aliases could affect cross-translation-unit consistency checks.\n\n6) Any project typedefs or macros that redefine/alias 'char' or 'const': a project might use typedefs or macros that change the effective type of the parameters (for example custom signed/unsigned char typedefs, or macros that add attributes). These can affect whether the pointers are truly const-qualified in the project context and must be examined to correctly apply the MISRA rule.\n\nCollecting the above symbols (prototype, callers, casts, and type definitions/aliases) gives the necessary context to determine whether the function's pointers are properly const-qualified and whether any code elsewhere violates MISRA's 'pointer should point to const when possible' requirement."
