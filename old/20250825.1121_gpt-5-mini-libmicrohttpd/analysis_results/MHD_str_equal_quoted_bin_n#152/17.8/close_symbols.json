  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" you must be sure the source-level tokens in the function behave as they appear. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- bool (definition / typedef / macro): If bool is a macro rather than the standard type, it could expand to something with side-effects (unlikely but possible in nonstandard code). Confirming its definition rules out hidden modifications tied to type macros.\n\n- true and false (macro / enum / constant definitions): If true/false are macros or function-like constructs, they might expand to expressions or code with side effects (e.g., assignments). We must confirm they are plain constants so that returns like \"return false;\" are not performing hidden modifications to parameters.\n\n- size_t (typedef / macro): If size_t were (nonstandardly) defined as a macro with side effects, operations and comparisons using quoted_len/unquoted_len could hide modifications. Confirm it is a simple integer typedef.\n\n- Any object-like macro named quoted / quoted_len / unquoted / unquoted_len: The C preprocessor replaces macro names before compilation. If any of these parameter identifiers are defined as macros, the function body (including the parameter declarations) could expand into code that assigns to or otherwise modifies what appears to be a parameter. To prove the function does not modify its parameters you must confirm no such macros exist or inspect their definitions.\n\n- Macro or #define for MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n: If the function name itself is a macro, the visible body could be the result of macro expansion; the real compiled code might be different and could modify parameters. Confirming there is no such macro (or inspecting it) ensures the provided source is the actual implementation.\n\nIn short: verify that the basic type/constant names are normal definitions and that none of the parameter identifiers or the function name are preprocessor macros that would change the apparent source. Once those symbols are confirmed to be ordinary (no side-effecting macro expansions), the function can be analyzed directly and it can be seen that the pointer parameters themselves are not assigned to (only local variables i and j are modified), so the MISRA rule is not violated."
