  "explanation": "- memcmp: the MISRA rule explicitly forbids using the Standard Library memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. The analyzer must know whether this function (or an alias) is called directly in the translation unit or in any inlined/macro-expanded code that affects this target function.\n- bcmp / MHD_memcmp / memcmp_s: project-specific wrappers/aliases or alternative memcmp implementations may be used instead of the literal \"memcmp\" symbol. The analyzer must check these symbols (macros or wrapper functions) because they might perform the forbidden memcmp string comparison.\n- size_t: the function operates on explicit length parameters (quoted_len, unquoted_len). Knowing the definition/semantics of size_t ensures lengths are treated as buffer lengths (not necessarily null-terminated strings) and helps determine whether comparing is length-based (allowed) or relies on null termination (relevant to the MISRA rule).\n- bool / true / false: type and boolean literal definitions are required to correctly parse/interpret the function return type and return values when analyzing compliance (syntactic/semantic understanding of return flow).\n- callers of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n: to fully decide whether the use context violates the MISRA rule you must inspect call sites \u2014 whether callers pass null\u2011terminated strings and whether callers instead use memcmp to compare those null\u2011terminated strings. Even if this function does not call memcmp, call-site behavior and how this function is used in the codebase can affect the overall compliance assessment."
