  "explanation": "No calls to the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided function. All string comparison is done character-by-character via quoted[i] != unquoted[j] using explicit length parameters (quoted_len, unquoted_len) and index bounds checks, so this code does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
