  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for unreachable-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- stdbool.h::bool/true/false\n  Reason: The function returns and tests boolean values (true/false). To reason about reachability of return statements and their meaning you must know the exact boolean type and values used in the project (typedefs/macros could alias or change semantics). This is needed to determine whether particular return paths are meaningful or optimized away.\n\n- stddef.h::size_t\n  Reason: quoted_len and unquoted_len are size_t. Knowing size_t is unsigned and its width is required to reason about the arithmetic and comparisons (quoted_len/2, comparisons with i/j) that control execution flow; unsigned wrap/overflow rules affect reachability of branches.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (prototype/declaration)\n  Reason: The function declaration (linkage, calling convention, attributes like inline/static/nonnull) can affect whether some paths are unreachable (for example, if attributes guarantee non-NULL or constant arguments). The prototype may also include annotations that impose constraints on parameters.\n\n- All callers of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (every function that calls this target)\n  Reason: A branch inside this function is only unreachable in the project if all call sites supply inputs that prevent that branch from ever being taken. To decide if any return/if branch is unreachable you must inspect every caller and the values they pass (e.g., constant lengths or sanitized buffers).\n\n- Producers/validators of the `quoted` buffer (functions that construct or sanitize the quoted string)\n  Reason: The inner branch that checks for a trailing backslash (if ('\\\\' == quoted[i]) { i++; if (quoted_len == i) return false; }) can be unreachable if upstream code never produces a quoted buffer ending with an unescaped trailing backslash. To prove or disprove that, the routines that build/validate quoted must be inspected.\n\n- Producers/validators of the `unquoted` buffer (functions that construct or sanitize the unquoted string)\n  Reason: The initial length check (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2) and final equality check (quoted_len == i && unquoted_len == j) can be rendered unreachable if callers guarantee specific relations between quoted/unquoted contents and lengths. Functions that build the unquoted buffer determine these relations.\n\n- All functions that compute or pass `quoted_len` and `unquoted_len` (length suppliers)\n  Reason: The control flow depends on numeric relationships among these length parameters (division, comparisons, loop termination). If those lengths are computed in a consistent way by other functions (e.g., always set to particular expressions or constants), some branches/returns may be provably unreachable; you must inspect those suppliers to decide.\n\n- Project-level invariants or macros that constrain input values (any macro or global that enforces length/format invariants, e.g. that quoted never ends with '\\\\')\n  Reason: Global invariants, configuration macros, or static assertions may forbid certain input shapes (for instance, sanitizers that strip trailing backslashes). Such constraints can make branches inside this function unreachable. To conclude a MISRA violation (presence of unreachable code) you must know whether those project-level guarantees exist.\n\nNote: To decide whether any particular statement or return in this function is unreachable in the project (MISRA), you must examine the concrete call sites, the code that produces the inputs, and any global/compile-time constraints. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to locate those definitions and prove or disprove reachability."
