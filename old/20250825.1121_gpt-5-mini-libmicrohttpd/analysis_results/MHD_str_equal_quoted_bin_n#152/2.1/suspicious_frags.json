  "explanation": "The listed fragments cover all code paths that can cause early returns or affect loop progression and therefore could hide unreachable code (initial length gate, the loop header with its dual index increments, the escape-sequence handling that increments i inside the loop, and the final length check). Other parts of the function are simple declarations/initializations (size_t i; size_t j;), the final \"return true;\", and comments \u2014 these are straightforward, reachable, and do not constitute unreachable code. No other statements in the function introduce conditional exits or control-flow constructs that could create unreachable code beyond the fragments already listed."
