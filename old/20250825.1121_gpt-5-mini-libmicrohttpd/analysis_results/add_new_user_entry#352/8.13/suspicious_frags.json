  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages were found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in the provided code. Rationale:\n\n- Function parameters username, password and realm are declared as const char *const, so they already point to const-qualified data and the pointer itself is const. No investigation needed.\n- struct UserEntry fields username and realm are declared as const char * (the pointed-to char is const), so the pointers point to const-qualified types as required by the rule. They could be made pointer-to-const-pointer (const char * const) to prevent changing the pointer value, but Rule 8.13 concerns the pointed-to type being const-qualified, which is satisfied.\n- The local variable entry is declared as struct UserEntry * because the function writes into the structure fields (entry->username, entry->realm, hash and digest buffers, allow_area_*). Making entry point-to-const would prevent these legitimate writes, so it must remain a non-const pointer and is not a violation.\n- The hash/digest buffers (uint8_t arrays inside UserEntry) are passed to the digest-calculation functions and must be writable; therefore they must not be const, and their current declarations are appropriate.\n- The user_ids array and user_ids_used are modified by the function (adding a new entry), so they cannot be const.\n\nNote: the only remaining potential check (outside the provided code) is to ensure the prototypes of the MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash / MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest functions accept const-qualified pointers for input string parameters (username, realm, password). If those APIs mistakenly declare input parameters as non-const char * while they do not modify the strings, that would be an API-level issue to fix. However, based solely on the provided code, there are no code fragments that violate Rule 8.13."
