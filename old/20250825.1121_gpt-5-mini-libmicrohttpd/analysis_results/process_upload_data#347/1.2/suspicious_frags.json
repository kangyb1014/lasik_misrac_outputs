  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of compiler-specific language extensions (per common vendor documentation) in the provided code. In particular:\n- No GCC/Clang/MSC extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (non-standard forms), typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_* calls, or other vendor-specific keywords are present.\n- No use of compiler-specific pragmas or _Pragma constructs is visible.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef WINDOWS, #ifdef O_LARGEFILE, #if defined(__CYGWIN__) etc.) and macro usage (including the odd deprecation macro shown in the enum snippet) are normal preprocessor constructs and not, by themselves, language extensions as defined by compiler vendors. The recursive-looking #define for MHD_RESPONSE_HEADER_KIND is a macro-level mechanism (deprecation helper) rather than a compiler language extension; it does not employ vendor-specific language features in the function body.\n- All casts, standard library calls (snprintf, write, open, close, strdup, strerror, isprint, mkdir), and standard types (uint64_t, size_t, int) are standard C or POSIX/platform APIs and not compiler extensions.\n- Conditional casts for the Windows write call (casting size to unsigned int) are portability workarounds but not compiler-specific language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibiting language extensions). If you want, I can re-scan for a specific compiler\u2019s documented extensions (e.g., MSVC, GCC, Clang) if you provide which compiler(s) are in use."
