The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "i: the loop counter (declared as size_t). Required to verify the first clause sets the loop counter, the third clause modifies only the loop counter, and that the loop body does not modify i. res: the integer result produced by snprintf used in the loop's second clause (i < (size_t) res). Required to verify the second clause uses only the loop counter (and allowed objects) and that res is not modified by the loop body or any called function. fn: the local char array (fn[]) whose elements are read and written in the loop body (fn[i]). Required to confirm that the second clause does not reference an object that is modified in the loop body and to inspect whether writes to fn constitute modification of objects used in the loop clauses. isprint: the function/macro called inside the loop body. Required because the MISRA text states the behaviour of the loop body includes called functions; you must confirm isprint does not have side effects that modify i or res or other objects used in the loop clauses. snprintf: the call that sets res prior to the loop. Required to understand how res is computed (possible negative or truncated values) and to confirm res is not subsequently modified by any function invoked inside the loop body."
