  "explanation": "To determine whether process_upload_data violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect recursion we must see every function it calls and any functions they may call that could reach back to process_upload_data. Explanations:\n\n- do_append (definition and its full transitive call graph / callees): process_upload_data calls do_append. The only possible path to indirect recursion is via do_append (or functions it calls). Therefore the complete implementation of do_append and the list/definitions of any functions it calls (transitive callees) are required to see whether there is any call path that leads back to process_upload_data.\n\n- struct UploadContext (complete definition): process_upload_data accesses fields of the UploadContext (category, language, fd, filename, response). If UploadContext contains function pointers or callback hooks that can be invoked (now or indirectly via do_append), those could create an indirect recursion path. The complete struct definition reveals whether any fields are function pointers or types that might lead to callbacks into process_upload_data.\n\n- request_refused_response (definition / type) and internal_error_response (definition / type): these identifiers are assigned to uc->response. Although they are not called in this function, their types (e.g., function pointer vs. plain value/object) and usages elsewhere could matter: if uc->response is a function pointer and assigning these causes code elsewhere to invoke them (or if they alias functions that call process_upload_data), that could create an indirect recursion path. Providing their definitions (or at least their types) lets the analyzer rule out such indirect recursion.\n\nNote: Standard library calls used inside process_upload_data (strcmp, fprintf, mkdir, snprintf, open, write, close, unlink, free, strdup, strerror, isprint, strchr, strstr, etc.) are assumed not to call back into application code. They do not need full definitions for recursion analysis unless do_append (or other transitive callees) invokes application callbacks; those will be covered by the transitive call graph requested for do_append."
