  "explanation": "For deciding whether the code violates the MISRA guideline that pointers should be const-qualified whenever possible, the analysis must know the exact types and prototypes that determine whether the pointers used in process_upload_data could/should be const. Each symbol is needed for the reasons below:\n\n- struct UploadContext\n  - Required to know the exact types of its members (category, language, filename, response, fd, ...). Whether members are declared as char * vs const char * (or some other pointer type) is the central question for the MISRA const rule. Also needed to see which members are mutated by the function (e.g. uc->category modified via do_append, uc->filename assigned strdup, uc->fd set), which prevents them from being const.\n\n- do_append\n  - The prototype/signature tells whether the function mutates the destination pointer or the pointed data (e.g. does it accept a char **, char *, const char *?). If do_append modifies the pointer or the underlying buffer, the destination must be non-const; if it only reads, it could be const. Knowing its parameter types is essential.\n\n- request_refused_response and internal_error_response\n  - These symbols (their type) determine the type of uc->response. If uc->response is a pointer type, its const-qualification may matter in the struct; to reason about whether uc->response could be const-qualified you need these symbol types.\n\n- strcmp, strstr, strchr\n  - These C library functions operate on strings passed to them. Their parameter const-qualification (standardly const char *) determines whether passing const char * members (e.g. uc->language or uc->category) would be acceptable.\n\n- snprintf\n  - Called with uc->language and uc->category as format arguments. Knowledge of snprintf's parameter expectations (variadic %s consumes const char *) and whether it modifies the supplied string (it does not) helps decide if those members could be const.\n\n- mkdir\n  - Called with uc->language and constructed paths. POSIX mkdir accepts const char *; confirming its prototype ensures that passing const-qualified language/category would be valid.\n\n- open\n  - The open call itself uses a local buffer 'fn' (not UploadContext members) but confirming its prototype and whether it modifies path strings is useful to determine whether uc->filename or other members must be mutable.\n\n- write\n  - write is called with the 'data' buffer (already const in the function signature). Confirming write takes a const void * (it does) helps confirm that 'data' should be const and that the code is already correct in that respect.\n\n- close, unlink, strdup, free\n  - strdup allocates and returns a char *; uc->filename is assigned strdup(fn) so the return type of strdup determines whether uc->filename must be char * (non-const). unlink takes const char * (so a const-qualified filename would be acceptable for unlink), free takes void * (requires non-const pointer for deallocation, practically meaning the pointer must be to mutable memory or cast). These prototypes are necessary to judge whether uc->filename (and similar members) can or cannot be declared const.\n\n- isprint\n  - Used to inspect bytes of fn; confirms that the code modifies the local fn buffer, not UploadContext members, but knowing its signature clarifies that no member is implicitly modified by this call.\n\n- strerror\n  - Used only in diagnostics; its prototype and constness are not central but included so the analyzer has full visibility of functions that accept char * / const char * in this function.\n\nIn short: the definition of struct UploadContext and the prototype of do_append are the primary symbols required to determine whether members should be const. The listed C library function prototypes are required to confirm whether passing const-qualified pointers to those functions is allowed (i.e. whether members could be declared const without breaking calls)."
