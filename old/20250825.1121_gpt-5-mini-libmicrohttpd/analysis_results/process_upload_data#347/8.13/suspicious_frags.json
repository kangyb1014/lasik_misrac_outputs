  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function should be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because every pointer that is declared as non-const is legitimately mutable in this context or must remain non-const to satisfy API/ownership semantics: \n\n- cls (void *), cast to struct UploadContext *uc: uc is modified (fields assigned, fd changed, filename set/freed, response set), so the pointed-to object must be non-const. \n\n- uc->category and uc->language (char *): these fields are populated/extended via do_append(&uc->category, ...) and do_append(&uc->language, ...). do_append modifies the pointer and allocated buffer contents, so these cannot be const-qualified. \n\n- uc->filename (char *): assigned with strdup(fn), later freed/unlinked; freeing requires a non-const pointer and the code may modify or free the buffer, so it cannot be const. \n\n- uc->fd (int) and uc->response (struct MHD_Response *): uc->fd is written to; uc->response is assigned; the pointer types must remain non-const to allow assignment and cleanup. \n\n- do_append signature: char **ret must be non-const because the function replaces *ret; data is already const (const char *data) which follows the rule. \n\n- Calls to library/system APIs (snprintf, mkdir, open, write, unlink, free, close, strdup, strcmp, strchr, strstr, isprint, write) expect mutable or non-const pointer types as used; for example write takes a const void * for the buffer but free/unlink require non-const pointers in practice. \n\n- Literal string arguments and function parameters that are read-only are already const-qualified where appropriate (e.g., const char *key, const char *filename, const char *content_type, const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data). \n\nGiven the above, there are no obvious places in the provided code where a pointer could be safely changed to point to a const-qualified type without breaking required semantics (modification, allocation/free ownership, or API contracts). Therefore no fragments need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
