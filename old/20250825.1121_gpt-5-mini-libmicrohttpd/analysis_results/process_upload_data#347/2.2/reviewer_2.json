  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements like \"(void) content_type;\" are expression-statements that are evaluated at run-time but have no side effects; removing them would not change the program's behaviour. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code: any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour), these are dead code. They are reachable and executed (so Note 2 does not apply), and they are not initializations (so Note 3 does not apply). Recommendation: remove the unused parameter names from the function definition or otherwise avoid no-op expression-statements (e.g. omit the parameter identifiers in the definition or use a documented compiler-accepted mechanism for suppressing unused-parameter warnings that is compliant with the project's MISRA interpretation)."
