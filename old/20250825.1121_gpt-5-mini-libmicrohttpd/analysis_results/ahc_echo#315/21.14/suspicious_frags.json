  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code. The only string comparison is performed with strcmp (if (0 != strcmp(method, \"GET\"))), which is appropriate for null\u2011terminated strings. Pointer comparisons (if (&aptr != *req_cls)) and library calls (MHD_* functions) do not involve memcmp here. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
