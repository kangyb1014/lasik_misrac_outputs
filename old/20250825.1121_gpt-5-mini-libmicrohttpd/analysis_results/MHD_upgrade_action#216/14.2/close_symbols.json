Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C 'for loop shall be well-formed' rule you must inspect any for-loops that occur in the target function or in any functions called from it (because the rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body). The listed symbols are required for that analysis: \n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: This function is directly called by MHD_upgrade_action. Its implementation may contain for-loops or call other routines that do; you must inspect it to determine whether any for-loops are well-formed and whether they modify objects that appear in loop clauses in ways that would violate MISRA. \n\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: Called by two branches in MHD_upgrade_action. You must examine its body (and any functions it calls) for for-loops or side effects that could interact with loop counters or loop-control flags. \n\n- MHD_DLOG: Called (directly or indirectly) by callees (e.g. MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_). Logging macros/functions sometimes contain internal loops or side-effecting code; inspect to rule out problematic loops or side effects. \n\n- mhd_assert: The assert macro is used in the target; its expansion could contain expressions or calls (even do/while wrappers) that matter if present inside a for-loop context. Include its definition to ensure it does not introduce loop-related side effects. \n\n- __builtin_unreachable: Present in the callees' static graph. While typically harmless, include to confirm no disguised loop constructs are involved. \n\n- shutdown: The target calls shutdown under HTTPS_SUPPORT. Include its declaration/usage to ensure no macro wrappers or project-specific replacement introduce loops or side effects relevant to MISRA's loop rule. \n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle, struct MHD_Connection, struct MHD_Daemon: Definitions are needed to know which fields are read/written (e.g. urh->was_closed, urh->app.socket, connection->state, daemon->options). When analysing for-loop correctness you must know which objects called functions may modify (fields of these structs) because the rule forbids loop-clause use of objects modified in the loop body. If any callee modifies these fields inside a for-loop, that could create a violation. \n\n- enum MHD_Result, enum MHD_UpgradeAction, MHD_YES, MHD_NO, MHD_USE_TLS, MHD_CONNECTION_UPGRADE: The enum/constant definitions are needed to fully understand control flow and which branches are taken; this is relevant to identify which callees (and thus which potential for-loops) are actually reachable. \n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: The conditional compilation macro controls whether shutdown() is invoked; include it to determine whether that code path (and any callees it enables) is present in the build being analysed.\n\nIn short: include the full source/definitions of the direct callees (MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_, MHD_connection_set_cork_state_) and any macros/utilities they use (MHD_DLOG, mhd_assert, shutdown), plus the type and macro definitions referenced in MHD_upgrade_action, so you can inspect all called code for for-loops and determine whether any loop counters or loop-control flags are misused or modified by called functions."
