  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the expression is an argument to the mhd_assert macro and not a controlling expression of a control statement. In the provided build mhd_assert(ignore) expands to ((void)0), so there is no control expression to which Rule 14.3 applies. (If mhd_assert were implemented as a control statement using an invariant condition, that implementation could be a violation, but that is not the case here.)"
