  "explanation": "The remaining conditional and switch expressions in the function are based on runtime inputs or state and therefore are not likely to be invariant: - NULL checks (if (NULL == urh), if (NULL == connection), if (NULL == daemon)) depend on the caller and runtime pointer values. - switch (action) inspects a parameter passed to the function; its value is not a compile-time constant. - if (urh->was_closed) reads a runtime-modifiable field. - The mhd_assert calls in this translation unit are defined as ((void)0) so they do not produce controlling expressions in this build. - The ternary operators that use the return value of MHD_connection_set_cork_state_ rely on that function's runtime result (not a compile-time constant in the shown code). These expressions therefore do not appear to violate Rule 14.3. The fragments listed in suspicious_frags were selected because they involve compile-time macros or bitmask macros (MHD_USE_TLS, MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME, MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_) or conditional logic whose outcome could be rendered invariant depending on build-time macro values or macro definitions; they should be investigated to ensure the controlling expressions are not constant in any relevant build configuration."
