  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The (void) req_cls; statement that Agent A complains about does not appear in the MHD_upgrade_action function \u2014 it appears in the uh_cb callback in the additional code. So the claimed violation against MHD_upgrade_action is a misattribution. Moreover, the cast-to-void idiom ((void) param;) is an explicit way to indicate an intentionally unused parameter and is commonly treated as a deliberate use to silence compiler warnings. In MISRA compliance practice this idiom is used to document intent and avoid an \"unused parameter\" issue; it is not treated as unintended dead code for the purposes of a Rule 2.2 complaint against MHD_upgrade_action. For these reasons the reported violation is incorrect."
