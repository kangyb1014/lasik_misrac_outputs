  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in typical usage: the code inside the #ifdef is either compiled-in and guarded by a runtime test (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS), so it can be executed, or it is removed by the preprocessor when HTTPS_SUPPORT is not defined (preprocessor removal is not the same as unreachable code at run-time). A specific violation scenario would require this condition to be provably never true at compile time \u2014 for example, if HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined and the expression (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS) can be determined by static analysis to be always zero (e.g. daemon->options is a compile-time constant 0 or MHD_USE_TLS is defined 0), making the shutdown() call unreachable. In the absence of such compile-time proof, Rule 2.1 is not violated."
