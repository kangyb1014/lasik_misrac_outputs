  "explanation": "To determine whether any code paths in MHD_upgrade_action are actually unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) the analyzer needs the following symbols and reasons: \n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: to know existence and types of urh->connection, urh->was_closed and urh->app.socket; needed to reason whether fields can be present/accessible and whether any branches are impossible due to type/layout. \n- struct MHD_Connection: to inspect connection->daemon and connection->state and whether state can legally equal MHD_CONNECTION_UPGRADE; required for the mhd_assert and control-flow reasoning. \n- struct MHD_Daemon: to read daemon->options usage and evaluate the HTTPS/TLS branch reachability. \n- enum MHD_UpgradeAction: to know the full set of valid enumerators and whether some switch labels cover all possible values or leave unreachable cases. \n- enum MHD_Result: to confirm values returned (MHD_YES / MHD_NO) and whether returns are valid. \n- MHD_CONNECTION_UPGRADE constant: to evaluate the mhd_assert condition and determine whether that path is feasible. \n- MHD_USE_TLS and daemon->options: to evaluate the conditional inside the HTTPS_SUPPORT block (whether that branch can be taken at runtime). \n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (preprocessor macro): this is a compile-time conditional; unreachable-code analysis must know whether the shutdown() block is compiled in. \n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: crucial \u2014 its implementation may not return (e.g., may call __builtin_unreachable or be marked noreturn). If that callee never returns, the subsequent return statement in the caller becomes unreachable. We must inspect its body/annotation. \n- __builtin_unreachable: the callee\u2019s use of this builtin (or similar) can make control flow not return \u2014 needed to decide reachability. \n- MHD_DLOG: called by MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_; if logging affects control flow (e.g., calls abort) that matters. \n- mhd_assert macro: its expansion may invoke non-returning behavior on failure; knowing its semantics is needed to decide if the assert can make later code unreachable in some builds. \n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: to confirm it returns normally (true/false) so the cork branches are reachable and the ternary return is not dead. \n- shutdown: prototype/semantics to confirm it does not transfer control (it does not), so the HTTPS branch does not itself introduce unreachable code; still include for completeness. \n- Call sites (run_usock, uh_cb): to see what 'action' values are actually passed in practice; if callers only ever pass a subset of enum values then some switch cases in MHD_upgrade_action could be unreachable in the shipped program. \n\nProviding these symbols (definitions and implementations where noted) allows the next analyzer to determine whether any statements in MHD_upgrade_action can never be executed (due to compile-time macros, callee non-returning behavior, impossible enum values from callers, or assertions that rule out paths), and therefore whether the function violates the MISRA rule against unreachable code."
