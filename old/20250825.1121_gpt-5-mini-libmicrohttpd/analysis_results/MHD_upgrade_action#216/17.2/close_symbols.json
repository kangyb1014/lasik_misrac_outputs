  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_upgrade_action violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls, the next analyser must see all functions that MHD_upgrade_action calls (directly) and the transitive callees that could lead back to MHD_upgrade_action (indirect recursion). Each listed symbol is required for that analysis for the reasons below:\n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: This is invoked unconditionally in the MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE case. We must inspect its body and its callees to see whether any path leads back to MHD_upgrade_action (indirect recursion).\n\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: MHD_upgrade_action calls this in the CORK_ON/CORK_OFF branches. The implementation and any functions it calls must be checked for paths that could eventually call MHD_upgrade_action.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: Static call graph shows MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ calls MHD_DLOG. Logging routines sometimes invoke callbacks or other subsystems; the analyser must inspect MHD_DLOG and its callees for any call chain back to MHD_upgrade_action.\n\n- MHD_resume_connection: The comment in the target function refers to MHD_resume_connection() as the routine that will move connections to cleanup when certain flags are set. MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ or other callees may call MHD_resume_connection (or similar helpers) which could, directly or indirectly, invoke MHD_upgrade_action or trigger a path that does. Include it to check those possible cycles.\n\n- mhd_assert: The target calls mhd_assert; the macro/function may expand to logging or error handling code (possibly invoking MHD_DLOG or other routines). The analyser should inspect its expansion/implementation to ensure it does not lead into a call chain back to MHD_upgrade_action.\n\n- run_usock and uh_cb: These are listed as callers of MHD_upgrade_action in the provided call graph. To prove absence of indirect recursion you must ensure that none of the callees of MHD_upgrade_action (or their transitive callees listed above) eventually call into run_usock or uh_cb (or any other path that reaches MHD_upgrade_action). Including these callers lets the analyser check for potential cycles involving external entry points.\n\nNote: __builtin_unreachable and the libc shutdown() call present in the source do not themselves create call-back paths to application code, so they are not necessary to include for recursion analysis. However, the analyser should still inspect the full implementations of the listed symbols and any additional callees they reference to conclusively determine whether any indirect call path returns to MHD_upgrade_action."
