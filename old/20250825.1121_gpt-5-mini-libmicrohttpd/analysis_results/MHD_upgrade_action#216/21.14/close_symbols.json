  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to decide whether this function (or the code it invokes) violates the MISRA rule banning the use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings:\n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: This function is directly called by MHD_upgrade_action. Any use of memcmp on NUL-terminated strings reachable from the target will likely occur inside this callee, so you must inspect its implementation.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: MHD_upgrade_action calls this for the CORK_ON/CORK_OFF actions. If this helper (or helpers it calls) uses memcmp on strings, that would make the upgrade-action path violate the rule; therefore its implementation must be checked.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: This logging helper is called (per the static graph) from MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_. Logging code sometimes formats or compares strings; include it to rule out any memcmp uses in the logging path.\n\n- memcmp: The actual standard-library symbol to detect. You need the declaration/usages of memcmp (or references to an equivalent wrapper) in reachable code to determine whether any code reachable from MHD_upgrade_action compares null-terminated strings with memcmp.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: Definition (members like connection, was_closed, app.socket) is needed to trace what data (especially any char* members) is passed to callees; if a char* member is compared via memcmp deeper in the call chain that would be relevant.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: Definition (members such as daemon, state) is required to follow data flow into called functions and determine whether string data stored here could be compared with memcmp.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: Definition (members such as options and any string fields) is needed to see whether data originating from the daemon can reach functions that might use memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\nTogether these symbols allow the next analyst to inspect the implementations and data-structures reachable from MHD_upgrade_action and determine whether any reachable call uses memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
