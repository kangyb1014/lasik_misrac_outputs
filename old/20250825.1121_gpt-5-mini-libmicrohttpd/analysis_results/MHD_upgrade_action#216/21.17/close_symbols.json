  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for out\u2011of\u2011bounds uses of <string.h> functions:\n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: This function is directly called by MHD_upgrade_action. Its implementation must be inspected for any use of memcpy/memmove/memset/str* etc or for passing pointers/lengths to other functions that use these routines.\n\n- MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: Although only invoked in the cork-on/cork-off branches, it appears in the source. Its body (and transitive callees) must be checked for any string.h usage and for the buffers/lengths it manipulates.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: Shown as a callee of MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_. Logging helpers often format or copy strings; inspect it for any direct use of string.h functions or unsafe buffer copies.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (fields: connection, was_closed, app.socket, clean_ready): The target function reads/writes these fields and passes the handle (or its subobjects) to callees. To determine whether any string function is used out-of-bounds you must know the exact layout, sizes and types of buffer/pointer fields inside this struct that might be passed to string APIs.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (fields: daemon, state, any buffer/payload fields): The connection object is passed to callees; inspect its buffer fields and sizes to see whether callees (including MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_) pass invalid pointers/lengths to string functions.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (fields: options, any buffer/payload fields): The daemon is read here (options & MHD_USE_TLS) and may be used by callees; its fields must be known if they are later used as buffers or length sources in string operations.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS (macro): Needed to understand the conditional path (shutdown) and any interactions that may lead to code paths in callees that perform string operations.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_UPGRADE (macro/enum): The assert compares connection->state to this value; knowing the semantics can help identify which code paths in callees are reachable from this state (and thus which functions to inspect for string usage).\n\n- All transitive callees of MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ and MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: Any indirect function called from these must be analyzed, because a string.h violation may occur deeper in the call chain. The transitive call set must be obtained and each implementation examined along with the buffer/length provenance (struct fields and local variables) to determine out-of-bounds risks.\n\nIn short: to determine MISRA violations related to <string.h> you must inspect the bodies of the direct callees, their logging helpers, all transitive callees, and the definitions/layout of the involved structs and macros that provide pointers/lengths to string functions."
