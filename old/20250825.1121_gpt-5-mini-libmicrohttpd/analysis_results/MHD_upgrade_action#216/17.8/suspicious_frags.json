  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The pointer parameter 'urh' is only dereferenced (e.g., urh->connection, urh->was_closed, urh->app.socket) and is not assigned to, incremented, or otherwise changed. The enum parameter 'action' is only read in the switch statement and not modified. The variadic parameter '...' is not used. There are no occurrences of taking the address of a parameter (e.g., &urh or &action) or passing a parameter by reference that could allow modification of the parameter itself. Calls to other functions (e.g., MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_) may modify the object pointed to by 'urh' (which is permitted by Rule 17.8), but do not modify the pointer parameter itself. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for a Rule 17.8 violation."
