  "explanation": "Why each is required to assess MISRA 'use const whenever possible':\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (definition): the function receives a pointer urh and dereferences urh->connection, urh->was_closed and urh->app.socket. To decide whether the urh parameter could/should be const we must see the actual fields and their types and whether any field is ever written by this function or by callees (so we can tell if the object is logically mutable).\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): connection is dereferenced (connection->daemon, connection->state) and is passed to other functions. The struct layout reveals whether callees can modify members (e.g. back-pointer to the upgrade handle) and whether connection should be const.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition): used for daemon->options; its type/fields determine whether reading options requires mutability and whether any callee may mutate daemon via connection->daemon.\n\n- prototype/implementation of MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: comment in the function claims this routine will set urh->was_closed (or otherwise mutate state reachable from connection). To decide if urh/connection must be non-const we must inspect this function to see what it writes (which objects/fields it modifies).\n\n- prototype/implementation of MHD_connection_set_cork_state_: this routine is called with the connection pointer; it may modify connection state. Its signature (const vs non-const parameter) and implementation determine whether connection must be non-const.\n\n- definition of field(s) inside MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle for 'app' (type of app.socket): the code calls shutdown(urh->app.socket,...). Knowing the type of app and socket field rules out pointer-typed members that might require const qualification; it also helps determine whether any pointer-to-member is being modified.\n\n- enum MHD_UpgradeAction (definition): to confirm which case labels are valid and whether any action implies modification of passed objects (semantic clarity; minor but useful for full analysis).\n\n- enum MHD_Result and constants MHD_YES/MHD_NO: to understand return values (not directly const-related but required for a complete semantic picture of the function's API).\n\n- macro MHD_USE_TLS and layout/type of daemon->options: used in the conditional that leads to calling shutdown. Knowing whether accessing daemon->options is a simple read and whether MHD_USE_TLS is a compile-time flag helps decide if daemon (or urh) must be mutable for that path.\n\nIn short: the struct definitions and the implementations/prototypes of the two callees (MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ and MHD_connection_set_cork_state_) are essential to determine which objects are written and therefore whether pointer parameters could be const-qualified. The other listed symbols supply contextual details needed to be certain about mutability."
