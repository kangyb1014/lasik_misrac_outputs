  "scenario": "The string literal \"\\n\" has type char[] but should be passed to a parameter declared as pointer-to-const. If post_process_urlencoded is declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. char *buf, size_t len), then passing the string literal here violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. The fix is to declare the function parameter as const char * (or otherwise ensure the function does not attempt to modify the data)."
