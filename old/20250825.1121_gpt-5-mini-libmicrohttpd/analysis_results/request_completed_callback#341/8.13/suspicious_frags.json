  "explanation": "Pointers that are written through, modified, or whose pointed-to objects are freed should not be made const and therefore do not need investigation: e.g. the local variable 'request' and uses of request->session, request->pp and the subsequent free(request) modify or free the underlying object. Similarly, MHD_destroy_post_processor manipulates and frees the 'pp' object (pp->have = ..., free_unmarked(pp), free(pp)), so its parameter cannot be const-qualified. The frees of pp->nested_boundary and pp itself also require non-const pointers. The other internal accesses (pp->state, pp->xbuf_pos, assignments to pp->have) all mutate the object and so are not candidates for adding const. These mutated usages therefore do not need further investigation under Rule 8.13."
