  "explanation": "For deciding whether pointers in request_completed_callback ought to be const-qualified under MISRA: \n\n- struct Request (definition): required to see the exact types of the fields (session and pp) and whether the Request object itself is modified (we free it and access members). If fields are pointers to mutable objects the pointer types cannot be const. \n\n- type/definition of request->session: the function decrements session->rc (request->session->rc--). To know whether the session object is modifiable (so the pointer must be non-const) we need the session type and the mutability of its members. \n\n- type/definition of request->pp (post-processor type): request->pp is passed to MHD_destroy_post_processor. Whether request->pp could be declared as a pointer-to-const depends on the post-processor type and whether destroy expects to modify it.\n\n- prototype of MHD_destroy_post_processor: its parameter type (e.g. takes struct MHD_PostProcessor * or void *) determines whether request->pp must be a pointer-to-non-const (if the API requires non-const) or could be const. The API contract fixes whether const qualification is possible.\n\n- callback prototype/typedef (MHD_RequestCompletedCallback): the signature declared by the library fixes const qualifiers for the parameters (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection, void **con_cls, enum ...). We must consult this declaration to determine whether changing any parameter to point-to-const would violate the required callback type.\n\n- definition of struct MHD_Connection and enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode: these appear in the callback signature. The library declaration may use const qualifiers on these types; to decide if the local parameters could/should be const we must inspect the exact API types.\n\n- prototype of free (void free(void *)): free's prototype accepts a non-const void*, so whether request (or other pointers) can be const-qualified interacts with calls to free (and any casts). MISRA guidance about unnecessary casts and const-discarding requires knowledge of free's signature.\n\nThese symbols together allow determining which pointers are actually modified, which API signatures mandate non-const parameters, and therefore whether any pointer should be const-qualified (or cannot be) under MISRA C rule."
