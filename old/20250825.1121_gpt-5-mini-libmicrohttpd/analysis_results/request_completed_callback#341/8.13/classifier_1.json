  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The parameters cls and connection are declared as non-const pointers but are not modified in the function; they could be const-qualified (e.g. const void *cls, const struct MHD_Connection *connection). req_cls cannot be made to point to a const-qualified type because the function obtains the Request object from *req_cls and modifies/frees it (request->session->rc-- and free(request)). If the function signature must match an external API callback prototype, the non-const parameters may be justified; otherwise cls and connection violate Rule 8.13."
