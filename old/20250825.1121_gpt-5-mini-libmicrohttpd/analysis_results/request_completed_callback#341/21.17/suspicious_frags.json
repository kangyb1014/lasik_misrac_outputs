  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function. The function only: assigns request = *req_cls, checks request for NULL, conditionally decrements an integer member (request->session->rc--), calls MHD_destroy_post_processor(), and calls free(). None of these are string.h functions or directly perform buffer/string operations that could access beyond object bounds as defined by Rule 21.17.\n\nNotes on other operations (not relevant to Rule 21.17):\n- The dereference of req_cls (struct Request *request = *req_cls;) lacks an explicit NULL check on req_cls itself; this is a potential general pointer-safety issue but not related to use of string.h functions and therefore outside the scope of Rule 21.17.\n- Calls to MHD_destroy_post_processor and free are not string.h functions and do not trigger Rule 21.17 checks here (their internal implementations are not shown; if they use string.h functions, those implementations should be reviewed separately).\n\nBecause no string.h functions are used in the shown code, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation specifically for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
