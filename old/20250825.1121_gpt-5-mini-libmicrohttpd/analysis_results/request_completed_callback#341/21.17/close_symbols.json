  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to assess potential out-of-bounds use of <string.h> functions:\n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor: The target function calls this directly. If it (or code it invokes) uses memcpy/strcpy/etc., that would be the path by which string.h functions could be involved. We need its implementation to inspect any use of string functions and their buffer/length handling.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded: Shown in the static call graph as a callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor. URL decoding/parsing routines commonly use string/memory functions; inspect its code to verify correct bounds checking.\n\n- free_unmarked: Also a callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor according to the call graph. It may touch memory or call string routines; its implementation must be checked.\n\n- struct Request: The function dereferences *req_cls to get request and accesses request->session and request->pp. Knowing exact field types/layout is required to determine whether request or its fields could be referenced (e.g., as post-processor callback context) after being freed or passed into code that performs string operations.\n\n- type/definition of request->pp (post-processor type): The post-processor object may hold callbacks and buffers. Understanding its structure and ownership semantics is necessary to determine whether destroying it can trigger code that calls string functions or whether it retains pointers into request-managed buffers that could be out-of-bounds.\n\n- code that creates/initializes request->pp (e.g., MHD_create_post_processor / create_response): The creation site tells which callback and context (cls) were registered with the post-processor. If the registered cls is the Request pointer (or contains pointers into Request buffers), callbacks invoked during destruction could access those buffers \u2014 possibly after free \u2014 leading to string.h violations.\n\n- callbacks registered with the post-processor (their implementations): These callbacks are the most likely places to use string/memory functions on buffers passed by the post-processor. You must inspect them for correct bounds checks and for whether they access memory that may have been freed or is otherwise out-of-bounds.\n\n- struct Session and its destructors/related functions: The code decrements request->session->rc. If that triggers session teardown or functions that use string functions on data that might have been freed or invalid, those paths must be examined for out-of-bounds string usage.\n\n- any other functions called (directly/indirectly) by MHD_destroy_post_processor/post_process_urlencoded/free_unmarked not already listed: The call graph in the prompt may be incomplete; any additional callees must be inspected for string.h usage and correct bounds handling.\n\nIn short: although request_completed_callback does not call string.h functions itself, the post-processor destruction it triggers and any callbacks/cleanup code associated with request->pp or request->session are the places where string functions could be invoked unsafely. The listed symbols provide the necessary code and type context to determine compliance with the MISRA string-bounds rule."
