  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's argument is literal but not practically correct in the MISRA context. While the statements \"(void) cls;\" (and the similar lines) do evaluate an expression whose removal would not change program behaviour at runtime (and therefore match the plain-text definition of \"dead code\"), the cast-to-void idiom is the conventional and accepted way to document/intentionally suppress unused-parameter warnings for callback APIs. In practice MISRA compliance assessments treat these explicit casts as an approved idiom (or else the parameter name may be omitted in the definition or a documented deviation/static-analysis suppression used). In short: although the statement is a no-op, it is intentionally present to suppress warnings and is not considered a violation in normal MISRA practice. Recommendation: either omit parameter names in the definition, or keep the (void) casts with an appropriate justification or documented deviation if required by your project's MISRA process."
