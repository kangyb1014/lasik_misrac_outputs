  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct. The three (void) parameter casts are idiomatic no-op expressions used to document and suppress \"unused parameter\" warnings; they do not constitute the sort of dead code Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets executed code whose removal would not change the program's observable behaviour. The casts have no runtime side effects and are not part of the program logic, but they express intent and are used to control diagnostics; they are therefore not treated as forbidden dead code in practice. Consequently this code does not violate Rule 2.2 (and many MISRA coding practices explicitly allow marking parameters as unused in this way)."
