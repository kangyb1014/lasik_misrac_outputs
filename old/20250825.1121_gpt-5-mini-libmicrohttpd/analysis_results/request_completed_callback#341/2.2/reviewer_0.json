  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The expression-statement \u201c(void) connection;\u201d evaluates the parameter expression solely to discard it and has no effect on program behaviour; removing that statement would not change the observable behaviour of the program. Under the plain wording of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), that statement is dead code. If the intent is merely to suppress an unused-parameter warning, the appropriate approach for MISRA compliance is to use a permitted mechanism (for example omit the parameter name in the function definition where possible, use an explicit, documented deviation, or a compiler-supported attribute) rather than leaving no-op discard statements without justification."
