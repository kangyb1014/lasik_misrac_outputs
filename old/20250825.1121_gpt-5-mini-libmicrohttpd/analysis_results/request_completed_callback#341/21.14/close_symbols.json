  "explanation": "To determine whether request_completed_callback (directly or indirectly) causes use of the Standard Library memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyzer must examine the implementation and data flow across the call chain and the related data structures:\n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor: This is the direct callee. Its implementation must be inspected to see if it (or its callees) invokes memcmp to compare strings.\n- post_process_urlencoded: Shown as a callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor in the static graph; it is a likely place for string comparisons (URL\u2011encoded parsing) and therefore must be checked for memcmp usage and the nature of the operands passed to memcmp.\n- free_unmarked: Also a callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor; include to ensure no indirect memcmp usage through this path.\n- struct Request: The target function dereferences *req_cls into struct Request and accesses request->pp and request->session. Knowing the layout and types of struct Request is required to follow pointers into the post\u2011processor or session data that might be compared with memcmp.\n- type/definition of request->pp (post\u2011processor object, e.g. MHD_PostProcessor struct): The post\u2011processor object may own buffers or strings that are compared. Its definition (fields and any function pointers) is needed to determine whether memcmp is being used on null\u2011terminated strings or on length\u2011specified buffers.\n- type/definition of request->session (session struct): Although less likely to be the source of string compares, the session object is manipulated here (rc--). Its definition is needed if memcmp is used on session strings via pointers reachable from request->session.\n- memcmp (standard library function) / any local memcmp wrappers: The analyzer must identify calls to the standard memcmp (or wrappers with the same name) in the code paths above to decide if they are being used to compare null\u2011terminated C strings (which would violate the MISRA rule).\n\nBy obtaining the implementations and the above type definitions, the next agent can trace any memcmp calls, inspect the arguments (pointers and lengths), and conclude whether memcmp is being mistakenly used to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
