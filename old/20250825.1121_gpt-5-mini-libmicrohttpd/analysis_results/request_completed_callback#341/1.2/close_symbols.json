  "explanation": "For determining whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect not only the function text but also the definitions and macros it references, because those definitions can hide compiler-specific extensions (for example __attribute__, GNU typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, non-standard calling conventions, or macros that expand to such constructs). Reason for each symbol:\n\n- struct Request (definition): the function dereferences and frees a struct Request instance and accesses members (session, pp). The struct definition might include compiler extensions (attributes on the struct or members, bit-field widths with implementation-specific behavior, packed/pragmas, or non-standard annotations) that would constitute use of language extensions.\n\n- type of request->session (session struct definition): the code adjusts request->session->rc. The session type could be a typedef or struct that carries compiler-specific attributes on the type or on member rc (e.g. packed, alignment, attribute), or rc could be a macro\u2014so its definition must be checked.\n\n- type of request->pp (MHD_PostProcessor or equivalent definition/typedef): request->pp is passed to MHD_destroy_post_processor. The pp type or its typedef may be a macro or use extensions; check its definition to ensure no language-extension usage.\n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor (declaration and/or definition): the call could be a macro that expands to compiler-specific constructs, or the function declaration/definition itself could use non-standard attributes or calling conventions. You must inspect its declaration/body to rule out extension usage introduced there.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (declaration/definition): although the parameter is unused, the type's declaration could contain extensions (attributes, packed, etc.) that would make the function signature rely on language extensions.\n\n- enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode (definition): the enumerated type used in the parameter list could be defined with compiler-specific extensions (attributes, explicit underlying type via extension), so check its definition.\n\n- NULL macro definition: the code uses NULL in pointer comparisons. Some environments define NULL in non-standard ways; verify NULL is a standard macro and not a compiler-specific construct.\n\n- free prototype (stdlib.h): free is called. While the standard free is not an extension, some projects redefine memory-management functions as macros or with attributes; inspect the prototype/definition to ensure no extension is used.\n\nChecking these symbols (their declarations/definitions and any macros that expand to them) lets the next analyst determine whether any language/compiler-specific extensions are present that would violate the MISRA rule."
