  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specific checks:\n- No use of compiler-specific keywords or attributes (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, __declspec, or similar) is present.\n- The function signature and use of struct and enum types are standard C declarations.\n- The (void)variable statements to suppress unused-parameter warnings are a standard idiom, not a compiler extension.\n- The assignment struct Request *request = *req_cls; involves assigning a void* (from *req_cls) to an object pointer type; implicit conversion between void* and object pointers is allowed in standard C and is not a compiler extension (even though some compilers may warn). If a project rule requires an explicit cast, that is a coding-standard choice, not a language-extension issue.\n- All other calls and operations (NULL comparisons, decrement, free, library function call) are standard C or library usage.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this snippet that should be flagged for possible use of language extensions under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
