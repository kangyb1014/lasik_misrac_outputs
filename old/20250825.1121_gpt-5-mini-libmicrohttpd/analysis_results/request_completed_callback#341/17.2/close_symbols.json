  "explanation": "To determine whether request_completed_callback violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls, the analysis must trace all possible call paths starting from request_completed_callback and follow every callee transitively to see if any path returns to request_completed_callback. The listed symbols are required for that analysis for these reasons:\n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor: Direct callee of request_completed_callback. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it calls request_completed_callback (directly) or any functions that could eventually call it.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded: A direct callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor. It must be examined because it could call functions (including callbacks) that lead back to request_completed_callback, forming an indirect recursion.\n\n- free_unmarked: A direct callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor. It must be inspected for the same reason as post_process_urlencoded \u2014 it might call other functions that create a cycle.\n\n- response_completed_callback, request_completed, create_response, generate_page: These functions are listed in the static call graph as callers of MHD_destroy_post_processor. Although they are callers (not callees) in the provided graph, they are relevant because implementations of MHD_destroy_post_processor or its callees could invoke them (or other functions that in turn invoke them). If any such invocation sequence reaches any function that eventually calls request_completed_callback, an indirect recursion exists. Including these symbols lets the next analyst check for such cross-calls and complete the transitive call-graph search for cycles.\n\nNote: If other functions are called by post_process_urlencoded or free_unmarked (or if any callback function pointers are invoked), those additional symbols must also be supplied so the transitive closure of callees can be examined for a path back to request_completed_callback."
