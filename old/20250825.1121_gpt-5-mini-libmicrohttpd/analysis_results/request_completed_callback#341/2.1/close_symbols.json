  "explanation": "Why each is required:\n\n- struct Request (definition)\n  - The function dereferences *req_cls into a struct Request and tests/uses its fields (session, pp). To determine whether any of the if-branches are compile\u2011time or obvious run\u2011time unreachable (e.g. if fields are compile-time constants, bitfields or have unusual definitions), the exact struct layout and types are required.\n\n- type/definition of request->session (e.g. struct Session)\n  - The code does request->session->rc--. To know whether that statement can execute (or whether it has side effects that affect control flow) you need the session type and the rc member. Also needed to check for any non\u2011returning behavior or macros on that member access that could make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- type/definition of request->pp (e.g. MHD_PostProcessor *)\n  - The condition if (NULL != request->pp) and the call MHD_destroy_post_processor(request->pp) depend on the exact type/definition of pp; if pp is a macro, or wraps special semantics, this could affect reachability analysis.\n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor (declaration/definition including attributes/behavior)\n  - Critical: if this function is declared with attributes that change control flow (noreturn, longjmp, abort, or a macro that expands to a non\u2011returning construct), then the code after the call (notably free(request)) could be unreachable when request->pp != NULL. You must examine the declaration/definition to determine whether the call always returns.\n\n- code that registers/invokes request_completed_callback and code that initializes *req_cls (the call sites that set req_cls)\n  - Whether the early return (if (NULL == request) return;) or any later statements are ever executed depends on how this callback is invoked and how req_cls is set by the rest of the program or by the MHD library. You need the project sites (or library API) that set *req_cls and register this callback to determine possible run\u2011time values of req_cls/*req_cls and thus whether any code paths are actually reachable.\n\n- callback prototype/semantics for the completion callback (MHD_RequestCompletedCallback / how req_cls is passed)\n  - The exact callback type and calling convention from libmicrohttpd (or the project wrapper) tells you whether req_cls can be NULL, whether *req_cls is guaranteed to be initialized before the callback, and what caller guarantees exist \u2014 all relevant to deciding if the NULL check and subsequent code are reachable.\n\nNotes:\n- The standard free() symbol is assumed unless the project replaces it; if the project wraps/free is redefined, its definition would also be relevant. If you suspect free is replaced by a non\u2011returning wrapper, include that symbol as well.\n- The static call graph entries for MHD_destroy_post_processor\u2019s callees (post_process_urlencoded, free_unmarked) are only relevant if you need to trace whether those functions introduce non\u2011returning behavior; otherwise they are not required to judge reachability inside request_completed_callback."
