  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function obtains a copy of the pointer stored in *req_cls (struct Request *request = *req_cls;) and calls free(request). This deallocates the object referred to by the pointer parameter but does not modify the parameter variable req_cls itself (nor reassign req_cls). Rule 17.8 permits modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter; it forbids modifying the parameter (pointer) itself. Therefore this code does not violate Rule 17.8. (Note: it does leave *req_cls potentially dangling, but that is not a Rule 17.8 violation.)"
