  "explanation": "- struct Request: Needed to see which members exist (session, pp) and whether any of those are aliases of the incoming pointer parameters. This shows that the code reads *req_cls into a local pointer and then manipulates fields of the object, which must be confirmed as permitted (MISRA allows modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter, but not the parameter itself).\n- type/definition of request->session (the session struct with member 'rc'): Required to determine that request->session->rc-- modifies a field of the session object (an object referred to by request, not a function parameter) rather than assigning to any of the function's parameters.\n- type/definition of request->pp (post-processor type): Needed to confirm that request->pp is an object owned by the request object (not an alias of a function parameter) and that passing it to MHD_destroy_post_processor does not modify any of the function's parameters.\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor (prototype): To verify its signature and that calling it does not modify any of the target function's parameters (only operates on the post-processor object passed by value).\n- free (prototype from <stdlib.h>): To confirm free takes a void* by value and does not modify the pointer parameter of request_completed_callback; freeing *req_cls's pointee is an operation on the object pointed to, not an assignment to a function parameter.\n- enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode (definition): To confirm toe is not modified and to rule out any required side-effect semantics of that enum type that could imply parameter modification.\n- semantics/ownership of req_cls (what *req_cls points to and who may free it): Although not a single C symbol, the ownership contract (caller/library expects the request context to be freed here or not) is necessary to judge whether freeing *req_cls is appropriate and whether that action should be considered a modification of a parameter vs. modification of the object it points to.\n\nThese symbols let an analyst determine whether the code performs any assignment to the incoming parameter variables (which MISRA forbids) versus allowed mutations of objects they point to (which MISRA permits)."
