  "explanation": "The MISRA rule concerns modification of function parameters (the parameter variables themselves must not be modified; objects pointed to by pointer parameters may be). The lines not listed do not modify any parameter variables: the (void) casts only suppress unused-parameter warnings, the NULL check and return (if (NULL == request) return;) only read values, and there are no assignments to the parameter identifiers (cls, connection, req_cls, toe). The reported fragments are the only places where the object obtained via the pointer parameter (req_cls -> *req_cls -> request) or related pointed-to objects are altered (decrementing a member, destroying a post-processor, freeing the object), so they should be investigated for compliance with Rule 17.8. No other lines modify the parameter variables themselves and therefore do not need investigation for this rule."
