  "explanation": "1) struct Request (definition): Needed to know the exact types and qualifiers of request->session and request->pp (e.g. whether they are declared const or volatile, or are bitfields). That determines whether the controlling expressions (NULL == request, NULL != request->session, NULL != request->pp) can be considered compile-time or translation-unit invariants or are modifiable at runtime.\n\n2) struct Session (definition): Required to inspect the session member type and its rc field (type/qualifiers). If session or rc are declared with qualifiers (const/volatile) or have semantics that prevent modification, that could make the controlling expression involving request->session effectively invariant in this context.\n\n3) definition/type of request->pp (post-processor type): Knowing the exact type of pp (and any qualifiers) is necessary to decide whether testing pp against NULL can be invariant, and whether calling MHD_destroy_post_processor(pp) could modify request->pp or other state that would affect later controlling expressions.\n\n4) prototype and implementation/semantics of MHD_destroy_post_processor: You must know whether this function can modify the memory reachable from request, including whether it frees or modifies the pp object or other members of *request or global state that could affect the truth value of the controlling expressions. If the callee has side effects that change the tested expressions, that affects whether the original tests are invariant.\n\n5) framework/caller contract for the void **req_cls parameter (MHD callback semantics): The semantics/documentation (or callers' code) that show how *req_cls is set and whether the framework guarantees it to be NULL/non-NULL or to be changed before/after invocation are needed. If the framework always supplies an invariant value for *req_cls at callback time (or guarantees it never changes), a controlling expression could be invariant; conversely, if callers/framework mutate *req_cls or other threads can change it, the expressions are not invariant.\n\nTogether these symbols allow determination of whether the if-condition expressions in request_completed_callback are truly invariant (compile-time or effectively constant in the function scope) or are legitimate runtime-varying checks (and thus whether the MISRA C controlling-expression rule is violated)."
