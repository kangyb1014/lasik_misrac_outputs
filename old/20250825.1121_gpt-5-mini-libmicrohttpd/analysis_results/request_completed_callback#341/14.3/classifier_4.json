  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The controlling expression (NULL != pp->nested_boundary) depends on the runtime value of pp->nested_boundary and is not a compile-time invariant. A violation would occur only if nested_boundary were guaranteed always NULL or always non-NULL at compile time (for example if it were a macro or compile-time constant), which is not the case here."
