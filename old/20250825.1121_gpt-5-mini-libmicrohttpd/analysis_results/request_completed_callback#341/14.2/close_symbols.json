Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To determine whether request_completed_callback can violate the MISRA 'for loop shall be well\u2011formed' rule you must be able to see all possible for loops and all modifications to objects that could serve as loop counters or loop control flags that are reachable from the target function. Explaination per symbol:\n\n- struct Request (full definition): request_completed_callback reads request->session and request->pp and frees the request. To check the rule you must know the exact layout and types of these members (and whether any members are used as loop counters elsewhere or have side effects when read/modified).\n\n- type/definition of request->session (the session struct, including member rc): the function decrements request->session->rc. If any for loop in this function or in functions called from it uses that same object (or rc) as a loop counter or loop-control flag, modifying it in the body would violate the rule. You need the session type to determine whether rc is an integer/Boolean/volatile/alias to some other object, and whether it could be a loop counter elsewhere.\n\n- type/definition of request->pp (post-processor object type, e.g. MHD_PostProcessor): request->pp is passed to MHD_destroy_post_processor. If pp is an alias to an object used as a loop counter or shared with other code containing for loops, that matters. Knowing the concrete type helps determine aliasing and side effects.\n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor (declaration and full definition / macro expansion): this is the direct callee inside request_completed_callback. To be sure the target function does not introduce or participate in an ill\u2011formed for loop you must inspect this symbol's implementation (or macro expansion). A macro with the same name could expand into a for statement in the caller context, or the function body could contain for loops whose behaviour interacts with objects modified by the caller.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded (definition) and free_unmarked (definition): these are callees of MHD_destroy_post_processor (per the static call graph). They may contain for loops or modify/shared objects that could be used as loop counters/control flags. Because the behaviour of any function called within a for loop body is considered part of that body (MISRA text), you must inspect the full transitive callees reachable from the call site to determine compliance.\n\n(Other symbols in the target function such as MHD_Connection, the enum toe, and free() are either unused or standard library calls that do not affect for\u2011loop formation in this context; they are not required for the MISRA-for-loop analysis.)"
