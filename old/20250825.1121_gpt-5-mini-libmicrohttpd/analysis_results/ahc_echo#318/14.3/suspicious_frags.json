  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are manifestly invariant. There are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) with constant conditions, and none of the selection statements use constant controlling expressions: \n- if (0 != strcmp(method, \"GET\")) \u2014 strcmp operates on the runtime method string, so the result is not a compile-time invariant.\n- if (&aptr != *req_cls) \u2014 although &aptr is an address constant, *req_cls is a runtime value supplied by the caller, so the comparison is not invariant.\n- There is no do-while with an integer constant expression.\nThe (void) casts are not controlling expressions. Given the rule and its exceptions (infinite loops and the do-while idiom), there are no fragments here that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
