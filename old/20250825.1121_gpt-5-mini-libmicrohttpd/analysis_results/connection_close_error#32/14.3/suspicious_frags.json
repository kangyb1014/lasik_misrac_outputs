  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Rule 14.3 targets invariant controlling expressions (typically loop or conditional expressions that are constant/invariant). The code contains no loops and the only runtime control statement is\n  if (NULL != emsg)\nwhich depends on the function parameter emsg and is therefore not inherently invariant. The #ifdef/#else preprocessor conditional is not a C runtime controlling expression covered by this rule. All other statements are simple assignments and a function call, not controlling expressions, so there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
