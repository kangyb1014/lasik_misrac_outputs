  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code and related symbols for any usage of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). No occurrences of these functions (or other functions from <string.h>) appear in the shown fragments. \n\nSpecific notes on fragments considered: \n- connection_close_error: sets boolean fields and calls MHD_DLOG with a format string and emsg; this uses variadic logging but does not call any <string.h> functions in the shown code. \n- MHD_DLOG: formats and forwards the va_list to a custom_error_log function; the code shown does not invoke any <string.h> functions. \n- MHD_connection_close_, MHD_destroy_response, MHD_pool_destroy, MHD_connection_mark_closed_: perform pointer handling, frees, memory unmapping, and socket shutdowns but no string.h calls. \n- The struct definitions reference read/write buffers and note that read_buffer is allocated one byte larger for NUL-termination, but there is no string.h usage in the provided snippets.\n\nBecause Rule 21.17 specifically concerns use of the named <string.h> functions, and none of those functions appear in the given code, there are no suspicious fragments to report from the provided material."
