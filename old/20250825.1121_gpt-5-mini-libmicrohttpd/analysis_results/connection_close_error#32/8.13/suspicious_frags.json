  "explanation": "No other code fragments need investigation for Rule 8.13: the emsg parameter is already const-qualified (const char *emsg); the two assignments at the start of the function (connection->stop_with_error = true; connection->discard_request = true;) modify the connection object, so the connection pointer must be non-const here; the use of (void) emsg; is just to suppress an unused-parameter warning and does not affect const-correctness. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions in this function that would need const qualification."
