  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are:\n- connection (struct MHD_Connection *): only the object pointed to is modified via member assignments (connection->stop_with_error = true; connection->discard_request = true;). Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; the pointer variable itself is not reassigned anywhere in the function.\n- emsg (const char *): it is only read (checked against NULL and passed to MHD_DLOG) or explicitly cast to void to suppress a warning; it is not modified.\nThere are no assignments or rebindings to the parameter variables themselves, so no violations of the rule are present."
