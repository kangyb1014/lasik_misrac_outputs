  "explanation": "I inspected the function and the related struct and selected pointer-containing declarations and uses that should be reviewed to determine whether the pointed-to types could/should be const-qualified. I did not include non-pointer items (e.g. integer fd), nor simple unused-parameter silence statements, nor other statements that clearly modify or release pointer targets (such as calls that free, close, or set pointer members to NULL) because those operations indicate the pointees must be mutable and therefore are not candidates for adding const qualification. Also, API-mandated signatures and callbacks may constrain parameter types; such constraints should be checked during investigation, but the list above includes the occurrences where const qualification might plausibly be applied and thus merit review."
