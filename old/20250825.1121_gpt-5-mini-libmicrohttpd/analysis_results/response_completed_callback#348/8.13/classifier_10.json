  "scenario": "The parameter `void *cls` (and similarly `struct MHD_Connection *connection`) is not const\u2011qualified even though it is unused and not modified in the function. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, an input pointer that is not used to modify the pointed-to object should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. `const void *cls`, `const struct MHD_Connection *connection`). Note: if this function signature is mandated by an external API (a callback prototype from the library), changing the qualification is not possible and constitutes an acceptable justification for deviating from the rule."
