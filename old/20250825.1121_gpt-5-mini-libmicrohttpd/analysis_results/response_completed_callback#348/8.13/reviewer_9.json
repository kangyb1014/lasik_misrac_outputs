If this pointer is only used for read-only access (e.g. pointing to string literals or only passed to printing/inspection routines and never modified), it should be declared 'const char *language;'.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types when that is possible. The code in response_completed_callback operates on uc->filename by unlinking and freeing it \u2014 these operations imply the pointed-to object is owned and mutable (freeing a const-qualified pointer would be inappropriate), so filename must be a non-const char * and does not violate 8.13. The members language and category are declared as char * in the struct, but the presented code does not show they are only ever read-only; Agent A\u2019s claim is speculative without examining all uses. In short: there is no demonstrated 8.13 violation in the shown function/definitions; the report is therefore not correct."
