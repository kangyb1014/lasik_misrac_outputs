  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (pointers should point to const-qualified type whenever possible) we need the precise types and prototypes that determine whether any pointer used in response_completed_callback could/should be const-qualified:\n\n1) struct UploadContext\n   - Required to know the exact types of uc members (pp, fd, filename). Whether filename is char * or const char * and the exact type of pp determines whether these pointers could or should be const-qualified.\n\n2) MHD_destroy_post_processor (prototype)\n   - Needed to know the parameter type expected by the destroy function (e.g., whether it takes MHD_PostProcessor * or const MHD_PostProcessor *). That tells us whether the pp member must be a non-const pointer and whether passing uc->pp here violates/obeys const qualification.\n\n3) type of pp (e.g., MHD_PostProcessor or whatever typedef is used)\n   - If pp is an opaque library type, its declaration/typedef is necessary to judge whether pp could be declared as pointer-to-const in UploadContext and still work with library calls.\n\n4) MHD_ResponseCompletedCallback (callback prototype / registration signature)\n   - The library callback typedef (the exact signature used when registering response_completed_callback) determines whether parameters cls, connection and req_cls are required to be exactly void *, struct MHD_Connection *, void ** (i.e., non-const) by the API. If the API requires non-const pointer types, the function cannot change them to const; if not, they might be const-qualified.\n\n5) struct MHD_Connection\n   - The definition/forward declaration of MHD_Connection is needed to decide if the connection parameter could be declared as pointer-to-const (const struct MHD_Connection *) because the function does not modify it.\n\n6) free (prototype from <stdlib.h>)\n   - free takes void * (non-const). If filename is freed, it cannot be typed as const char * without an explicit cast; this prototype shows that filename must be a non-const pointer (or be explicitly cast), which is directly relevant to const qualification of uc->filename.\n\n7) unlink (prototype from <unistd.h>)\n   - unlink takes const char *; showing unlink accepts a const-qualified string helps determine whether filename could be const for that call. Combined with free's prototype (above), this helps determine the strongest const qualification possible for filename.\n\nThese symbols give the required type-level information to decide whether pointers in this function (cls, connection, *req_cls / uc, uc->pp, uc->filename) could/should be const-qualified under MISRA guidance and whether the current code violates that rule or is constrained by library APIs."
