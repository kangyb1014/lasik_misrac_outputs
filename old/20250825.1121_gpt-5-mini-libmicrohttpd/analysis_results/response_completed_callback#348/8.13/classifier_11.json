  "scenario": "No. In this code pp is stored to be destroyed later via MHD_destroy_post_processor(uc->pp), i.e. the pointed-to object is managed/modified/freed by non-const APIs, so declaring a non-const pointer is appropriate. (If instead pp were only ever accessed by read-only APIs, then it should be declared as const struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp to satisfy Rule 8.13.)"
