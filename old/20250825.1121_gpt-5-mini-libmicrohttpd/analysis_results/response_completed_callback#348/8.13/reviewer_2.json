True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' is declared as a pointer to a non-const type but is not modified (and in this function is unused). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, it should point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection') if possible. This is a violation unless the function prototype must match an external API (callback signature) that requires a non-const parameter, in which case the exception applies.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function response_completed_callback:\nstruct UploadContext\n{\n  /**\n   * Handle where we write the uploaded file to.\n   */\n  int fd;\n\n  /**\n   * Name of the file on disk (used to remove on errors).\n   */\n  char *filename;\n\n  /**\n   * Language for the upload.\n   */\n  char *language;\n\n  /**\n   * Category for the upload.\n   */\n  char *category;\n\n  /**\n   * Post processor we're using to process the upload.\n   */\n  struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp;\n\n  /**\n   * Handle to connection that we're processing the upload for.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *connection;\n\n  /**\n   * Response to generate, NULL to use directory.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_Connection\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. Rule 8.13 indeed recommends using const for pointer targets when possible, but this function is implementing the libmicrohttpd request-completed callback prototype (void (*)(void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection, void **con_cls, enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode)). The callback signature is fixed by the external API and therefore cannot be changed to take a const-qualified pointer. MISRA permits matching required external/provided interfaces even if that prevents adding const, so this use does not constitute a violation. (Also note the code explicitly marks the parameter as unused; the UploadContext and its connection member are likewise declared with non-const types in the surrounding code/API.)"
