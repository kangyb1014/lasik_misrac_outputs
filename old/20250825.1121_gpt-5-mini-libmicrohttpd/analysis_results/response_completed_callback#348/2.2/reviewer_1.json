  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C Rule 2.2 prohibits dead code \u2014 executed operations whose removal would not affect the program behaviour. The three lines \u201c(void) cls;\u201d, \u201c(void) connection;\u201d and \u201c(void) toe;\u201d are the conventional way to mark parameters as intentionally unused to suppress compiler warnings. They do not change runtime behaviour, but neither are they the kind of inadvertent dead code that Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid. In practice MISRA users accept the explicit (void) param; pattern as a documented way to indicate an unused parameter (or alternatively one can omit the parameter name in the function definition or use compiler-specific unused attributes). If a project policy were to forbid such no-op expressions, that would be a separate, stricter constraint, but as a plain Rule 2.2 violation the agent A\u2019s claim is incorrect."
