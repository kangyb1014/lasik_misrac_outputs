  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The statement \u201c(void) toe;\u201d is the common idiom to explicitly mark a parameter as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although it is an expression-statement with no runtime side-effects (so, in a literal reading, removing it would not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour), MISRA\u2019s prohibition on \u201cdead code\u201d is intended to avoid unreachable or leftover logic that masks faults \u2014 not to ban deliberate no-op annotations used to document or suppress warnings. In practice this idiom is an accepted way to indicate an intentionally unused parameter; if a project wishes to avoid such statements it can use a standardized UNUSED(x) macro or other documented mechanism, but the mere presence of \u201c(void) toe;\u201d in this callback is not a substantive MISRA Rule 2.2 violation in the sense that the rule is meant to address. Therefore the report that this line constitutes a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct."
