The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of response_completed_callback:\n```c\nstatic void\nresponse_completed_callback (void *cls,\n                             struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                             void **req_cls,\n                             enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)\n{\n  struct UploadContext *uc = *req_cls;\n  (void) cls;         /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The assignment uc->pp = NULL is dead: within response_completed_callback the post-processor pointer is destroyed via MHD_destroy_post_processor(uc->pp) and immediately the whole UploadContext object uc is freed at the end of the function (free(uc)). No subsequent code observes uc->pp (and *req_cls is not updated), so setting the member to NULL has no effect on program behaviour \u2014 removing the single assignment would not change program behaviour. Therefore this operation constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
