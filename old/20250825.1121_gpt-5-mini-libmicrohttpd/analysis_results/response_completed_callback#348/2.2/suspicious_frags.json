  "explanation": "The remaining statements perform observable side-effects or control flow that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Specifically: calls that release resources or mutate external/system state (MHD_destroy_post_processor(...), close(...), unlink(...), fprintf(...), free(...), free of nested resources in the post-processor, and the final free(uc)) all have effects that removing them would change program behaviour. The conditional checks that gate those operations (e.g. checking uc != NULL, fd != -1 before close/unlink) affect whether those side-effects occur and so are not dead. The cast-to-void applied to the results of functions (other than the three explicit unused-parameter casts listed above) is used to discard return values but the function calls themselves have side effects, so those calls are not dead. Therefore only the listed fragments appear to be operations whose removal would not change runtime behaviour and should be investigated further."
