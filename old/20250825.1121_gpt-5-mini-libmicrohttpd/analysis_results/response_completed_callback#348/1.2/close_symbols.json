  "explanation": "For checking whether response_completed_callback or any symbols it uses rely on compiler language extensions (MISRA check), the next analyst must be able to inspect the declarations/definitions that could introduce such extensions. Each listed symbol is required for the reasons below:\n\n- struct UploadContext: The function dereferences *req_cls to an UploadContext and frees its contents. The UploadContext definition must be inspected to see if the struct itself uses any compiler extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bit-fields with nonstandard widths, flexible-array members implemented non\u2011standardly, compiler-specific annotations, or nonstandard storage-class extensions).\n\n- struct UploadContext::pp (type of pp, e.g. MHD_PostProcessor): uc->pp is passed to MHD_destroy_post_processor and tested for NULL. The concrete type of pp may carry compiler-specific annotations or nonstandard calling conventions; the prototype/definition of that type must be examined for attributes or extensions.\n\n- struct UploadContext::fd: The fd field is passed to close(). Its type (e.g. int) should be confirmed to ensure no nonstandard typedef or extension is used in the struct declaration.\n\n- struct UploadContext::filename: A pointer freed/unlinked and printed. The declaration could use extensions (e.g. custom pointer qualifiers or attributes) that must be checked.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function declares a parameter of this type (unused). Its definition may contain compiler-specific extensions (attributes, nonstandard storage qualifiers) and must be checked.\n\n- enum MHD_RequestTerminationCode: The enum type used as a parameter may be declared with compiler-specific extensions (enum size/underlying-type attributes). Inspecting its declaration is necessary to determine whether an extension is used.\n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor (prototype/definition): This is called by the target function. Its prototype or definition may include compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...)), calling-convention specifiers, inline asm in declaration) that would constitute language extensions; the analyzer must inspect it.\n\n- close (prototype): A libc/system call wrapper\u2014its declaration may include compiler attributes or nonstandard annotations. To determine whether the call or the use (casting away the return value) employs an extension, the prototype should be checked.\n\n- unlink (prototype): Same rationale as close: check its declaration for attributes or nonstandard annotations.\n\n- fprintf (prototype): Standard I/O declarations in some builds carry compiler-specific attributes (e.g. format-checking __attribute__((format(printf,...)))). Those are compiler extensions; the prototype should be inspected to decide if using them constitutes a code-level extension relevant to MISRA.\n\n- stderr (symbol/definition): stderr is used as an argument to fprintf. Its declaration/definition (FILE object) could carry nonstandard attributes; the symbol should be validated.\n\n- free (prototype): The deallocation function prototype may include attributes (nonnull, leaf, etc.) or nonstandard annotations; check to ensure no language extension is introduced via its use or declarations.\n\n- NULL (macro): The code compares pointers against NULL. The actual definition of NULL on the target toolchain can be a compiler/library extension (e.g. ((void*)0) vs 0 vs __null). The exact definition must be known to determine if a language extension is implicitly used.\n\nNote: The goal is to detect explicit compiler/language extensions declared in the symbols used by this function (attributes, nonstandard calling conventions, asm, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, or other documented extensions). The listed symbols are the minimal set required to examine those declarations/definitions for such extensions."
