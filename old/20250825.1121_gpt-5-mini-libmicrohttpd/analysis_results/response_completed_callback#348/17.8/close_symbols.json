  "explanation": "1) struct UploadContext: The function reads and modifies members of *uc (uc->pp, uc->fd, uc->filename) and frees uc. To decide whether any function parameter is being modified you must know that uc is derived from *req_cls and the exact types of pp/fd/filename (pointer vs non\u2011pointer) to tell whether the code modifies the pointer parameters or only the object they point to.\\n\\n2) MHD_destroy_post_processor: The prototype and semantics are needed to determine whether this called function can modify the caller's parameters (for example, if it takes a pointer-to-pointer and writes back) or frees/changes memory reachable from uc->pp. If it modified req_cls or req_cls's contents via side effects, that could constitute modification of a parameter of response_completed_callback.\\n\\n3) libmicrohttpd callback contract for req_cls: The ownership/lifetime rules for the per-request user pointer stored in req_cls (who must free it, whether the callback is expected to NULL-out *req_cls, etc.) are necessary to judge whether freeing uc (the object obtained from *req_cls) is permitted and whether leaving *req_cls unchanged (potentially dangling) counts as modifying a parameter under the applicable API/contract and MISRA interpretation."
