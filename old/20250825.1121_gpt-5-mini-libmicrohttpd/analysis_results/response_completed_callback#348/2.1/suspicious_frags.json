  "explanation": "Fragments not listed (e.g. the function signature, the local assignment 'struct UploadContext *uc = *req_cls;', and the '(void) cls/connection/toe;' lines) are not suspected of being statically unreachable: they execute unconditionally when the function is invoked and are deliberate (the casts silence unused-parameter warnings). There are no obvious unconditional constant expressions (e.g. if (0) { ... }) or code placed after an unconditional jump that would make it permanently unreachable across all executions. The reported fragments are the conditional blocks and the early return whose reachability depends on runtime data (req_cls/uc and members of *uc) and therefore merit investigation to determine whether any of them are in fact never reached in the project (which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1)."
