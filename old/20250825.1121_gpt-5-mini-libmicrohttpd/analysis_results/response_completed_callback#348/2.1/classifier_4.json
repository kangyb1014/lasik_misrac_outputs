  "scenario": "No unreachable code in the fragment. Both the outer 'if (-1 != uc->fd)' and the inner 'if (NULL != uc->filename)' are conditional on runtime values and so their bodies can be executed depending on uc->fd and uc->filename. A concrete violation scenario (not present here) would be if the condition were a compile-time constant (e.g. if (0) { ... }) or if code followed an unconditional return or goto making it impossible to reach, for example if uc->fd were a compile-time constant equal to -1 making the outer branch permanently unreachable."
