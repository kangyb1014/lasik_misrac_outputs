  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if (NULL != uc->filename) free(uc->filename); is reachable whenever uc != NULL and uc->filename is non-NULL; the function only returns early when uc == NULL, otherwise control flows through to that check. A violation would occur only if control could never reach that point (for example an unconditional return or infinite loop before it), which is not present here."
