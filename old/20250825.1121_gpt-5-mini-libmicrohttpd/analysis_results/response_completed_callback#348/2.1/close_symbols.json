  "explanation": "- struct UploadContext (definition): The function dereferences *req_cls into an UploadContext pointer and inspects fields uc->pp, uc->fd and uc->filename. To determine whether branches (if (NULL==uc), if (NULL!=uc->pp), if (-1!=uc->fd), etc.) are reachable for any run, the concrete type and any invariants/initial values of these fields (and whether any fields are const/compile-time constants or set elsewhere) are required.\n- sites that register or call response_completed_callback (callback registration/dispatch): Whether the whole function is unreachable in the project depends on whether it is ever registered or invoked by the HTTP framework. You must supply the symbols/locations where this callback is passed to the server library (or otherwise referenced) to determine if the function itself is reachable.\n- code that allocates/initializes and clears *req_cls (functions that set req_cls to an UploadContext or NULL): To decide reachability of the internal branches (especially the early return when uc==NULL) you need the code that stores the request-specific pointer into req_cls (allocation path, successful/failed upload paths, and any code that resets it to NULL). This lets you know whether uc can be NULL or always non-NULL at entry.\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor (declaration/definition and attributes): If this function is marked noreturn or performs longjmp/exit, later code might be unreachable. Its prototype/implementation and any attributes are needed to reason about control flow.\n- close / unlink / free / fprintf (declarations/definitions and attributes): Similarly, these standard functions could, in theory, be replaced/macro-wrapped or annotated (noreturn/longjmp). Confirming their declarations/attributes ensures calls to them do not render subsequent code unreachable."
