  "explanation": "To determine whether response_completed_callback (or any function it invokes) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer needs the following definitions: \n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor: response_completed_callback calls this function; its implementation must be inspected to see whether it (directly) uses memcmp on string data. \n\n- post_process_urlencoded: listed as a callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor in the call graph. If MHD_destroy_post_processor forwards string pointers or invokes this function, post_process_urlencoded must be checked for memcmp usage on null-terminated strings. \n\n- free_unmarked: also listed as a callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor; its implementation must be inspected for memcmp usage on strings. \n\n- struct UploadContext: response_completed_callback accesses uc->filename (and other fields). The definition is required to confirm the type and ownership/terminator semantics of filename (e.g., char * null-terminated string vs. a length-delimited buffer) so you can judge whether any memcmp use on that data would be a string comparison. \n\n- memcmp: the implementation/signature and all call sites found in the above functions must be examined to see how memcmp is used (buffer vs. C-string comparison) so you can determine if a forbidden null-terminated string comparison occurs."
