  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this function. The only use of a character pointer (uc->filename) is passed to fprintf, unlink and free; none of these are functions from <string.h>. Therefore there are no string.h usages here that could cause out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17 and no fragments need further investigation for that specific rule."
