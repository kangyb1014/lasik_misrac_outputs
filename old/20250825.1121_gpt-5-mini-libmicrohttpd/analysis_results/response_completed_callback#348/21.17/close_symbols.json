  ],
  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required\n\n- struct UploadContext (definition)\n  Reason: The target function dereferences uc->filename and other fields (pp, fd). To determine whether any string-handling functions could read beyond the bounds of filename, we must know the exact type of filename (char *, fixed-size array?), ownership semantics, and how it is allocated/terminated. Null-termination and buffer length info are essential to check for out-of-bounds reads by string functions.\n\n- All functions that allocate/initialize an UploadContext and/or assign to UploadContext->filename (all source locations that set or modify uc->filename)\n  Reason: The safety of passing uc->filename to fprintf/unlink (and any string functions elsewhere) depends on how filename is created and populated. Any strcpy/strncpy/memcpy/strlen or similar used when building filename can introduce non-terminated or truncated buffers. You must inspect the assignment/initialization sites to verify correct null-termination and buffer sizes.\n\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor (implementation/source)\n  Reason: The target function calls MHD_destroy_post_processor on uc->pp. Although the target itself does not call string.h functions, MHD_destroy_post_processor (or its callees) could access buffers that are related to the UploadContext or that otherwise rely on uc->filename or data owned by the post-processor. Inspecting its implementation is needed to find any string.h calls that may operate on UploadContext-owned buffers.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded (implementation/source)\n  Reason: This function is listed as a callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor in the static graph. It likely parses form data and may perform string operations (parsing filenames, extracting values). If it manipulates buffers that become uc->filename or are otherwise reachable from the UploadContext, its use of string.h routines must be checked for bounds safety.\n\n- free_unmarked (implementation/source)\n  Reason: Also a callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor; it may traverse/free buffers or strings allocated during post-processing. It could contain string.h calls that access memory related to the upload context.\n\n- create_response, request_completed_callback, request_completed, generate_page (implementation/source)\n  Reason: These functions are callers of MHD_destroy_post_processor (per the static graph) and are likely part of the request/upload handling flow. They may allocate or modify UploadContext or the buffers that feed uc->filename. Inspecting these callers can reveal code paths that populate filename (including any string.h usage), which is necessary to determine whether passing filename to fprintf/unlink risks out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- All call-sites of the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) that take UploadContext pointers or uc->filename (or buffers owned by UploadContext) as arguments\n  Reason: The MISRA rule specifically targets these functions. To decide if the target function violates the rule (directly or indirectly), you must find every use of these string.h functions that operates on buffers owned by the UploadContext (including uc->filename and buffers reachable via uc->pp). Each call-site must be inspected for correct length arguments, null termination, and buffer bounds to ensure no access beyond object bounds occurs.\n\nNotes\n- The target function itself does not call any string.h functions, but it passes uc->filename to fprintf and unlink, which read the string contents. Ensuring those reads are safe requires knowledge of how filename was created and whether it is a valid NUL-terminated buffer. Likewise, destroying the post-processor (uc->pp) could invoke routines that operate on buffers related to the UploadContext; those routines must be inspected for string.h usage and correctness.\n- Provide the source (or at least prototypes and key code paths) for the listed symbols so the next analyst can trace allocations, modifications, and any string.h calls that may lead to out-of-bounds accesses."
