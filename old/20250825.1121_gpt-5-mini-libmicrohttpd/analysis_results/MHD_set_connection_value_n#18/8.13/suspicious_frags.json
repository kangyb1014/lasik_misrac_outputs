  "explanation": "The only pointer parameter in this function that is not const-qualified is 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' (appearing in the function header and passed through to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_). According to Rule 8.13, such a pointer should be reviewed to determine whether it could be declared as pointing to const (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Connection *') because key and value are already const-qualified. Other fragments do not need investigation: 'const char *key' and 'const char *value' are already const-qualified; size_t and enum parameters are not pointer types; use of strlen on key/value is appropriate since strlen accepts const char *; there are no other pointer objects in the shown code that could be const-qualified."
