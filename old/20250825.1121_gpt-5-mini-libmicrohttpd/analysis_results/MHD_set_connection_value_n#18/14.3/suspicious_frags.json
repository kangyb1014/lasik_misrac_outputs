  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant and therefore no fragments requiring investigation for Rule 14.3. Specifically:\n\n- In MHD_set_connection_value_n the controlling if expression depends on the parameter kind and on key/key_size/value/value_size (strlen(key) and strlen(value) when non-NULL). These values are runtime inputs, so the expression is not invariant.\n\n- In connection_add_header the if tests the runtime result of MHD_set_connection_value_n against MHD_NO; the function return depends on inputs and internal state, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- There are no for/while/do-while loops or other conditional constructs with constant/compile-time-only controlling expressions in the provided snippets. The enum constants (e.g. MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND) are compile-time constants but are compared to runtime variables, so those comparisons are not invariant.\n\n- The odd macro around MHD_RESPONSE_HEADER_KIND is not used as a controlling expression in the shown code.\n\nThus, based on the provided code, there are no candidate fragments violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
