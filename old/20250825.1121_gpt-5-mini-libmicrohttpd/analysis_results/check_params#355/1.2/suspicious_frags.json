  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The following potentially suspicious constructs are standard C and do not constitute compiler extensions:\n\n- '! 0' and 'return ! 0;': use of the logical-not operator with a constant is standard C and yields 1. This is not an extension.\n- Concatenated string literals across lines in printf: adjacent string literal concatenation is standard C.\n- Casting expressions like (unsigned int) argc and the comparison between size_t and unsigned int: these are standard C casts and integer promotions, not extensions.\n- The function signature using 'char *const *const argv': pointer qualifiers are standard C.\n- Use of uint16_t: fixed-width integer types from <stdint.h> are part of standard C (C99 and later), not a compiler extension.\n- Use of standard library functions sscanf, strcmp, printf, fprintf: these are standard C library functions.\n\nNo occurrences of known compiler extensions were found (no use of __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, labels as values, or other vendor-specific keywords/features). Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
