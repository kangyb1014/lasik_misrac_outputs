  "explanation": "To decide whether code in check_params constitutes dead code (assignments or operations that could be removed without affecting program behaviour) you must know where the effects of those operations are observed. For each listed symbol: \n\n- force_md5, force_sha256, force_sha512_256: these globals are written in check_params. You must find all places in the program that read these flags (e.g. hashing, response generation, conditional behaviour) to determine if the assignments are meaningful or removable. If no readers use them, the assignments would be dead. \n\n- allow_rfc2069: written in check_params; same rationale \u2014 determine whether any reads elsewhere change program behaviour (e.g. authentication fallback). \n\n- daemon_port: assigned from argv in check_params. You must locate where this value is consumed (e.g. when starting the daemon or binding sockets) to see whether assigning it has an effect. If no consumer reads it or a hardcoded/default value is always used instead, the assignment may be dead. \n\n- main: the top-level caller that orchestrates program initialization and likely calls functions that read the globals. You need main to see call sites and data flow from check_params to runtime behaviour (order of initialization, whether check_params return value affects later code). \n\n- run_mhd: likely part of the runtime path that would use daemon_port or algorithm flags; include to check reads/uses of globals during server runtime. \n\n- process_params, check_apply_params: parameter-processing and apply-check routines commonly read or re-evaluate global options. They may override, ignore or rely on values set by check_params; include them to determine whether check_params writes are redundant. \n\n- update_cached_response: functions that generate cached responses may choose hash algorithms (force_md5/sha256/sha512_256); include to find uses of the hashing flags. \n\n- add_new_users: user-related logic may be affected by allow_rfc2069 or hashing choices; include to see side-effects. \n\n- MHD_start_daemon: the microhttpd start function (or wrappers around it) is the most likely consumer of daemon_port; include to verify whether daemon_port influences socket binding or is ignored. \n\n- strcmp, sscanf, fprintf, printf, stderr: the library calls used inside check_params must be considered because they have observable side effects (I/O and parsing). To determine if removing parts of check_params alters program behaviour you must consider whether these calls' outputs or effects are required (for example, reporting unrecognized parameters via fprintf or the informational printf when force_sha512_256 is set). If those I/O effects are required, removing them would change behaviour and thus is not dead code.\n\nProviding the definitions/usages of the above symbols (especially the global variables and the functions that might read them) is sufficient to trace reads of the values set in check_params and decide whether those assignments and the I/O in check_params are dead under the MISRA C dead-code rule."
