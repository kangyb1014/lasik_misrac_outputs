  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check MISRA rule on string.h usage in check_params:\n\n- strcmp\n  - strcmp is the string.h function actually used on argv[i]. To determine if its use can access beyond the bounds of the argv[i] object we must inspect the call site and know the exact contract/prototype and semantics (it scans until a terminating '\\0' and dereferences the pointer). Any analysis of potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds reads must consider how strcmp is invoked and what guarantees hold for its pointer argument.\n\n- sscanf\n  - Although sscanf is not from <string.h>, it also reads argv[i] as an input string (\"%u\"). If argv[i] were not a valid NUL\u2011terminated string or were NULL, both strcmp and sscanf could read out of bounds. Include sscanf so the analyzer can check that use as an additional evidence of whether argv[i] is required to be a valid NUL\u2011terminated string before the strcmp call.\n\n- main\n  - check_params is called from main (call graph shows this). To decide whether argv[i] passed into check_params is a valid, non\u2011NULL, NUL\u2011terminated C string (so strcmp cannot read past its bounds), the analyzer must inspect how main obtains and passes argc/argv (startup contract, any preprocessing or mutation of argv elements before calling check_params). Include main to see the origin and any modification of argv/argc.\n\n- force_md5, force_sha256, force_sha512_256, allow_rfc2069\n  - These globals are written by check_params. The analyzer must see their declarations/definitions to ensure they are ordinary scalar flags (not macros, not arrays, not objects that alias or overlap argv storage). If any are defined in an unusual way (e.g. as arrays, packed structs, or macros that expand to memory operations), that could affect memory layout or cause aliases that change whether a string access is safe. Include these symbols to confirm they are simple scalars and do not influence buffer bounds.\n\n- daemon_port\n  - check_params assigns a cast value to daemon_port. Include its declaration/type to confirm it is a scalar (e.g. uint16_t) and not some buffer/array or memory\u2011mapped object which could influence or overlap with argv buffers. Also confirms no unexpected side effects that could affect string storage.\n\nIn short: inspect strcmp and sscanf usage and the origin/validity of argv (via main), and confirm that the globals modified here are ordinary scalars so they do not create aliasing or memory\u2011layout concerns that could make the strcmp call illegally read past object bounds."
