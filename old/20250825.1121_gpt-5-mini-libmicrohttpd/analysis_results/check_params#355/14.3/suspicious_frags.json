  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. Each selection/iteration controlling expression depends on runtime inputs or variables that change during execution:\n- if (2 > argc) depends on the parameter argc.\n- for (i = 1; i < (unsigned int) argc; ++i) depends on i (which is incremented) and argc (function parameter), so the loop condition is not invariant.\n- The series of if/else if comparisons (0 == strcmp(argv[i], ...)) depend on argv[i] and the runtime result of strcmp.\n- The sscanf check ((1 == sscanf(argv[i], \"%u\", &port_value)) && (0 < port_value) && (65535 >= port_value)) depends on argv[i] and port_value (written by sscanf), so it is not invariant.\n- The final if (force_sha512_256) depends on a variable that may be set in the loop.\n\nThe use of expressions like force_md5 = ! 0 or allow_rfc2069 = ! 0 are constant assignments but are not controlling expressions and therefore not relevant to Rule 14.3. No do-while/infinite-loop exceptions apply. Consequently, there are no fragments requiring investigation for possible violations of MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3."
