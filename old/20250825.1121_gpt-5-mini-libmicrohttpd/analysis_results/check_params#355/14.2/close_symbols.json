Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Provide these symbols because the MISRA requirement concerns what objects appear in the three clauses of the for loop and whether they are (a) loop counters, (b) used in the second clause, or (c) modified by the loop body (including functions called from the body). For each symbol:\n\n- i\n  - Role: the loop counter (declared size_t). Required to verify there is exactly one loop counter, that it is initialized in the first clause (i = 1), and that it is not modified inside the loop body or by any called function.\n\n- argc\n  - Role: used in the second clause (i < (unsigned int) argc). Required to verify the second clause uses only the loop counter and allowed objects, and to ensure argc is not modified in the loop body or by any called function.\n\n- argv\n  - Role: indexed inside the loop body (argv[i]). Included because objects used in the body might alias or otherwise affect objects used in the header; we must confirm argv usage does not modify i or argc.\n\n- port_value\n  - Role: local used with sscanf and later assignment. Included to confirm that operations on port_value in the body cannot affect the loop counter or argc (no aliasing/modification of header objects).\n\n- force_md5, force_sha256, force_sha512_256, allow_rfc2069, daemon_port\n  - Role: globals modified in the loop body. Included to check the MISRA constraint that the second clause shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body and to ensure none of these globals appear in the loop header (they do not). Also included to show they are not loop counters or loop-control flags used in the second clause.\n\n- strcmp, sscanf, fprintf, printf\n  - Role: library functions called from the loop body. Their semantics must be known to determine whether they can modify the loop counter or argc (directly or via side effects/aliasing). These standard functions do not modify their input string arguments or non-aliased local variables like i/argc; including them lets the analyzer rely on their behaviour when checking the rule.\n\n- size_t, uint16_t\n  - Role: types of i and daemon_port. Included so the analyzer can reason precisely about the loop counter\u2019s type, the comparison i < (unsigned int) argc (promotion/compatibility), and the allowed modifications of the loop counter (increment ++i).\n\nIn short: i and argc are essential to determine whether the three clauses obey MISRA's restrictions; argv and the locals/globals modified in the body are included to ensure none of them are used in the header or alias the header objects; the called functions are included to establish they do not modify i or argc. These symbols are sufficient to decide whether the for loop in check_params is well-formed per the quoted MISRA rule."
