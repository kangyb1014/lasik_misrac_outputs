  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in check_params is unreachable you must know the declarations, linkage and possible constant/compile-time values of the globals it reads/writes and the behavior/signatures of the library symbols it calls:\n\n- force_md5: global used and assigned inside the option branches and tested (indirectly, after loop). If this symbol is declared const, macro, or otherwise cannot be changed at runtime the branches that set or test it could be unreachable. Knowing its type, linkage and initialization is required.\n\n- force_sha256: same rationale as force_md5; it participates in mutually-exclusive option branches and affects reachability of later conditional code.\n\n- force_sha512_256: used to select an option and later tested to decide whether the printf note executes. If this symbol is const/macro or initialized to a fixed value unreachable code could result; its declaration/value/type must be known.\n\n- allow_rfc2069: written in one branch. If this symbol cannot be written (e.g. const/macro) the branch may be unreachable; its declaration/type/initialization matter for reachability analysis.\n\n- daemon_port: assigned in the sscanf branch. Its type and declaration matter (and whether it has side-effects or is a macro) to determine whether that branch is meaningful/reachable.\n\n- strcmp: the option dispatch relies on strcmp returning 0 for matches. To conclude whether any strcmp branch is impossible you must assume/confirm ordinary strcmp semantics (prototype, no unusual replacement/macro, not defined to behave differently in this build).\n\n- sscanf: the branch that parses a numeric port depends on sscanf returning 1 for \"%u\"; need sscanf prototype/semantics (and whether it has been redefined) to know if that branch can be taken.\n\n- fprintf: used in the final else to print an error and return. If fprintf were redefined to longjmp/abort (or is a macro with side-effects) that could affect reachability of subsequent code; its standard behavior must be known.\n\n- printf: the final note is guarded by force_sha512_256; knowing printf semantics and whether it is replaced matters for whether that statement is reachable/has side-effects.\n\n- stderr: used as the stream target for fprintf. If stderr is redefined/unavailable it could affect the error branch reachability or semantics.\n\n- uint16_t: daemon_port is cast to uint16_t; its exact type and width (definition from stdint.h or an alternate typedef) affects whether the assignment or branch logic could be optimized away or considered undefined, which can affect unreachable-code analysis.\n\nIn short: the global option variables and the I/O/scan functions (and the daemon_port type) are necessary to decide whether any conditional/branch in check_params is impossible (compile-time constant/non-modifiable or has nonstandard behavior) and therefore unreachable under MISRA C's rule against unreachable code."
