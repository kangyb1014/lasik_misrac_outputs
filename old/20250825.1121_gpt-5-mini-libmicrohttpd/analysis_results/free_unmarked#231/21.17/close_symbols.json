  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor\n  - The function operates on members of this struct (content_name, content_type, content_filename, content_transfer_encoding, and have). You must know the exact member types, ownership semantics (are these char * to heap memory or pointers into another buffer?), and layout (is have a bitfield or integer) to judge whether freeing them or later string operations can cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- NE_content_name, NE_content_type, NE_content_filename, NE_content_transfer_encoding\n  - These macros/enum values determine the conditions under which free_unmarked frees each pointer. You need their definitions to know when a pointer is left intact vs freed and thus whether later string.h calls could operate on freed or invalid memory.\n\n- post_process_multipart\n  - A direct caller of free_unmarked and also a function that builds/parses multipart data. It may set the content_* members, use string functions, or create pointers into input buffers (non-heap). Inspecting it is required to see how the pointers were produced and whether string.h calls elsewhere might access beyond object bounds.\n\n- process_multipart_headers\n  - Called by post_process_multipart; likely where content_* members are assigned or parsed. You must inspect how strings are written/terminated, whether strncpy/strncat/strlen/mem* variants are used, and whether content_* point to heap allocations or substrings of a larger buffer.\n\n- process_value_to_boundary\n  - Also used by post_process_multipart to extract header values; it may return pointers into a larger buffer or allocate new storage. Knowing its behaviour is essential to determine if later string.h functions will access beyond actual object bounds.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded\n  - Called by MHD_destroy_post_processor (another caller of free_unmarked). It may set or manipulate content_* members or perform string operations; you need to inspect it for string.h usage and pointer provenance.\n\n- find_boundary\n  - Parsing functions like this often return pointers into the original input buffer. If content_* are set to such pointers, freeing them is invalid and string.h operations using them could go out-of-bounds. Inspecting find_boundary helps determine whether content pointers are substrings of larger buffers.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_\n  - This helper is listed as a callee of post_process_multipart; it likely compares strings, possibly using strn* or memcmp. You must inspect its implementation to see which string.h routines are used and whether they might read beyond the provided object when called with the content_* pointers and lengths used in callers.\n\nIn short: to determine whether free_unmarked leads to any violation of the MISRA string-h functions rule you must know how the content_* pointers are produced, whether they point to independently allocated storage or into larger buffers, when they are freed (via the NE_* flags), and where string.h functions are subsequently invoked on those pointers. The symbols above provide the definitions and call-sites necessary to make that determination."
