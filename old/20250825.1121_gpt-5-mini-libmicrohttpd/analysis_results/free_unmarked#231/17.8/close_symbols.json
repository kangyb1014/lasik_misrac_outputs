  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): Needed to know the exact types of pp->content_name, pp->content_type, pp->content_filename, pp->content_transfer_encoding and of pp->have. MISRA's rule distinguishes modifying the pointer parameter itself (forbidden) from modifying the object it points to (allowed). If these members are pointer types (e.g. char *), then setting them to NULL and freeing their targets modifies the pointed-to objects (permitted). If they were array members or something unusual, the semantics could differ \u2014 so the struct layout and member types are required.  \n2) NE_content_name / NE_content_type / NE_content_filename / NE_content_transfer_encoding: These macros/constants are used in the bit tests (pp->have & NE_...). Their definitions are required to ensure they are plain integer constants/flags (no side-effects or macro expansions that could modify pp or other objects).  \n3) free (declaration / macro definition): Confirm whether free is the standard library function (void free(void *)) or a project macro with side effects. If free were a macro that, for example, reassigns its argument or otherwise modifies pp, that could violate the rule; so the actual definition is needed.  \nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the code modifies the pointer parameter pp itself (which would violate the MISRA rule) or only modifies the objects referenced by pp (which is allowed)."
