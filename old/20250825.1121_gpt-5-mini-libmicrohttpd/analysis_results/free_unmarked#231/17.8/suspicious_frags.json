  "explanation": "The function has a single pointer parameter (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp). MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself (reassigning pp), but allows modifying the object referred to by the pointer. In this code no assignment to pp occurs \u2014 only members of the object pointed to (pp->content_name, pp->content_type, pp->content_filename, pp->content_transfer_encoding) are freed and set to NULL. Those are modifications of the pointee, which the rule permits. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation with respect to this rule."
