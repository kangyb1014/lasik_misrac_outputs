  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_PostProcessor (definition including fields: content_name, content_type, content_filename, content_transfer_encoding, have and any volatile/const qualifiers)\n   - Why: The controlling expressions reference pp->content_name, pp->content_type, pp->content_filename, pp->content_transfer_encoding and pp->have. To decide if the if-condition is invariant you must know the types and qualifiers of those members (pointer types, whether any are declared volatile or const, whether 'have' is a plain integer, bitfield or volatile). Volatile/side-effect-bearing qualifiers or bitfield widths can make an expression non\u2011invariant; conversely, a compile-time constant member (or a field that cannot change in the function\u2019s contexts) could make the expression invariant.\n\n2) Definitions of NE_content_name, NE_content_type, NE_content_filename, NE_content_transfer_encoding (macros or enum values)\n   - Why: The expressions test (pp->have & NE_...). If any NE_... value is 0 or otherwise produces a constant result for all possible pp->have values in practice, that conjunct becomes a constant (e.g. (0 == (pp->have & 0)) is always true). Knowing the numeric values of these NE_... symbols is essential to determine whether the bitwise tests can be invariant.\n\n3) Type and declaration of the 'have' field (if not obvious from the struct)\n   - Why: The semantics of the & operation depend on the type of 'have' (signed/unsigned, width, bitfield). A zero-width bitfield or a field with restricted range might make the expression effectively constant. Also needed to judge whether reads of 'have' can produce varying results (e.g. if it is volatile or updated elsewhere).\n\n4) Definition of NULL macro\n   - Why: The code compares pointer fields against NULL. Although NULL is normally a constant, knowing its definition (e.g. ((void*)0) vs 0) and pointer types can be relevant when reasoning about whether the pointer comparison can be statically constant in this build/ABI.\n\nNotes: The free() function and the callers listed in the call graph are not required to determine whether the controlling expressions are invariant at the point they are evaluated (the tests are evaluated before the free calls). The principal risk for an invariant controlling expression here is that one of the NE_... constants or the have field\u2019s type/qualifiers makes the bit-test a compile-time constant; therefore the NE_... definitions and the struct layout/qualifiers are the critical symbols to inspect."
