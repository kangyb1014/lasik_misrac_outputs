  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions. The only controlling expressions in this function are the four if conditions above; they must be examined to ensure they are not invariant. All other fragments in the function (the calls to free(), the assignments setting pointers to NULL, the function signature, and the block delimiters) are not controlling expressions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3 and do not need investigation for this specific rule. No loops or do-while constructs are present that would invoke the stated exceptions."
