  "explanation": "- struct MHD_PostProcessor: free_unmarked operates on pp->content_* and pp->have; to determine whether any of those fields are NUL-terminated strings (subject to the memcmp rule) we need the struct definition.\n- Type of the content_* members: if content_name/content_type/content_filename/content_transfer_encoding are char * (NUL-terminated strings) the MISRA memcmp rule is relevant; if they are e.g. binary buffers or other types, the rule may not apply.\n- NE_content_* flag values: understanding the semantics of the 'have' bit flags is needed to confirm that free_unmarked only frees string pointers and does not perform any hidden comparisons that could involve memcmp via macros or inline logic.\n- free prototype: to verify free_unmarked only calls free and does not call or alias memcmp via some custom free macro/override.\n- NULL macro: used in the function; confirm it is the standard null pointer macro and not redefined to something that could involve comparisons.\n- memcmp declaration / project wrappers: to check whether memcmp (or a macro that expands to it) is used anywhere in code paths affecting these fields (or by any inline/wrapper called or expanded in this function). Including memcmp lets the next agent verify there is no indirect use of memcmp on these string fields.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal items needed to decide whether free_unmarked itself (or anything it directly invokes/expands to) uses memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings and therefore could violate the MISRA rule."
