  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if-statement body can be reached at run-time when pp->content_transfer_encoding is non-NULL and the NE_content_transfer_encoding bit is not set in pp->have. There is no evidence in the fragment that the condition is always false or that control flow makes the block impossible to reach (no preceding unconditional return, compile-time constant false condition, or #if that excludes it). (A hypothetical violation would occur only if the condition were provably always false at compile time or the code were guarded by mutually exclusive compile-time macros or earlier unconditional return, which is not shown here.)"
