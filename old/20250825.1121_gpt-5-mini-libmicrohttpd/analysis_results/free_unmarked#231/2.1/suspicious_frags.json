  "explanation": "The only code that could be unreachable (or whose reachability needs verification) are the bodies of the four guarded free/assignment blocks above; those are reported. Other parts of the function\u2014specifically the function signature, the conditional test expressions themselves, the control-structure syntax (ifs and braces), and the final closing brace\u2014are ordinary control constructs and do not constitute separate unreachable statements to investigate beyond the listed blocks. No other statements exist in the function that could be unreachable."
