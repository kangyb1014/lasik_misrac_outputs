  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment is reachable whenever at runtime pp->content_filename is non-NULL and the NE_content_filename bit is not set in pp->have (e.g. content_filename was allocated but not marked as present). Under normal use this will cause the free() and assignment to NULL to execute. There is no evidence in the provided code that the condition can never be true (no constant expressions or control flow making it unreachable), so Rule 2.1 is not violated."
