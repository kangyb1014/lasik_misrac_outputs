  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from this fragment alone. The pointer is being freed and then nulled, which implies it points to dynamically-allocated, modifiable memory \u2014 in that case declaring it non-const is appropriate. A violation would occur if pp->content_name is never modified (only read) and is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. char *content_name) even though it could be const char *; in that situation Rule 8.13 would be violated."
