  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains only the parameter declaration and control checks; these are not candidates for adding const to the pointed-to types. The function assigns NULL to the struct pointer members (modifies the pointer values) so those pointer variables cannot be declared to point-to-const in this context. Also, memory is deallocated with free(), which requires passing a void* (casting away const would be required if fields were declared as pointers-to-const and is generally undesirable). The NULL and bitmask checks themselves do not indicate a missing const qualification. Therefore only the four blocks that access/free the struct's pointer fields are relevant for investigation under Rule 8.13."
