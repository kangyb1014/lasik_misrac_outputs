  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "From the fragment alone there is no clear violation. The code frees and NULLs an owning pointer (pp->content_transfer_encoding) which implies the pointer is used to manage mutable storage; such owning pointers need not be const-qualified. To determine a violation you must inspect the declaration and other uses: if the pointee is never modified (read-only usage) but the declaration is non-const (e.g. char * instead of const char *), that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
