  "explanation": "To decide whether free_unmarked violates the MISRA rule \"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" we must know whether the pointers freed by this function are intended to point to mutable memory (char *) or to immutable data (const char *), and whether other code writes to or reassigns those pointers.\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (definition): the exact field types (e.g. char * vs const char *) and the layout are required to determine if the content_* members are declared with const qualification.\n- pp->content_name, pp->content_type, pp->content_filename, pp->content_transfer_encoding (declarations/types): explicit field declarations are needed to see their pointer element types and const-qualification.\n- pp->have (declaration/type): to understand how the NE_content_* flags are interpreted (bitfield/integer type) and whether ownership semantics are encoded in 'have'.\n- NE_content_name, NE_content_type, NE_content_filename, NE_content_transfer_encoding (macros/enum values): to understand the meaning of the branch condition (whether a given content_* was supplied/owned) and whether that implies ownership/alloc responsibility vs a borrowed const pointer.\n- post_process_multipart (definition): this caller likely initializes or assigns the content_* fields; its code is needed to see whether it writes into or assigns non-const buffers or stores pointers to literal/const data.\n- post_process_urlencoded (definition): another routine that may set content_* fields; needed for the same reason as above.\n- process_multipart_headers and process_value_to_boundary (definitions): these helper routines (called by post_process_multipart) are likely where content_* pointers get set; their behavior determines whether the pointers are mutable/owned or borrowed const data.\n- free (declaration from <stdlib.h>): to confirm the signature (void free(void *)) and to reason about constness interactions (free requires void*, so freeing a pointer declared const would require a cast, possibly violating MISRA).\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyzer determine (1) the declared constness of the pointers freed here, (2) whether other code mutates the pointees or assigns non-const pointers (thus making const qualification infeasible), and (3) whether freeing a const-qualified pointer would require a cast or contradict ownership semantics. Without these definitions you cannot soundly determine whether the code violates the MISRA rule."
