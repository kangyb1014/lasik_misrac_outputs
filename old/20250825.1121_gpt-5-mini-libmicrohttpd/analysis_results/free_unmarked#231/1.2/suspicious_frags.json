  "explanation": "I examined the provided function free_unmarked and the related struct MHD_PostProcessor definitions. I did not find any compiler-specific language extensions that would require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- There are no anonymous structs/unions, zero-length arrays, or flexible array members used as compiler extensions.\n- The use of standard identifiers and types (NULL, free, size_t, uint64_t, bool) is standard C (bool corresponds to the standard _Bool when stdbool.h is present) and not a compiler extension.\n- Bitwise operations on enum values (pp->have & NE_content_name) are normal C operations and not an extension.\n\nThe repeated copies of the struct definition in the additional code appear to be duplicate excerpts rather than use of an extension. Therefore there are no code fragments that use explicit compiler language extensions to report."
