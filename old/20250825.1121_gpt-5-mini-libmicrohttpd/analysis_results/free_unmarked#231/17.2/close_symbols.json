  "explanation": "To determine whether free_unmarked participates in direct or indirect recursion we must inspect the call graph around it. Each listed symbol is directly connected (caller or callee) in the provided static call graph and therefore required to rule out a cycle that returns to free_unmarked:\n\n- post_process_multipart: immediate caller of free_unmarked; its body must be inspected to see if it (or functions it calls) can call free_unmarked again (indirect recursion) or form a cycle.\n- MHD_destroy_post_processor: immediate caller of free_unmarked; must be checked for any call chains that could lead back to free_unmarked.\n- MHD_post_process: caller of post_process_multipart; included because recursion could occur via higher-level callers calling back down the chain.\n- post_process_urlencoded: callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor; included because it could contain calls that lead back into the chain that reaches free_unmarked.\n- find_boundary: callee of post_process_multipart; its implementation could call other functions that form a cycle back to free_unmarked.\n- process_multipart_headers: callee of post_process_multipart; must be checked for any calls that would ultimately call free_unmarked.\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: callee of post_process_multipart; included to ensure it does not call back into the call chain creating recursion.\n- process_value_to_boundary: callee of post_process_multipart; must be checked for potential callbacks into the chain.\n- __builtin_unreachable: listed in the static graph for completeness (builtin), to confirm it does not affect call-cycle analysis.\n- create_response: caller of MHD_destroy_post_processor; included because higher-level callers may participate in a cycle.\n- request_completed_callback: caller of MHD_destroy_post_processor; included for the same reason as create_response.\n- response_completed_callback: caller of MHD_destroy_post_processor; included for the same reason.\n- generate_page: caller of MHD_destroy_post_processor; included for the same reason.\n- request_completed: caller of MHD_destroy_post_processor; included for the same reason.\n\nAnalyzing the bodies of these symbols (their call targets) is necessary to prove there is no path from any of them back to free_unmarked, which is required to determine compliance with the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls."
