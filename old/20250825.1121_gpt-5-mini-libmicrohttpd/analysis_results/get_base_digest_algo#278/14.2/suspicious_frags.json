  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I found no for statements in the provided code fragments. Rule 14.2 applies to for loops; therefore only code containing for statements (or macros that expand to for statements) needs investigation. The supplied items are:\n\n- get_base_digest_algo function: contains only local variable declaration, bitwise operations, casts and a return; there is no for statement or loop counter manipulation.\n- enum MHD_DigestAuthAlgo3 and enum MHD_DigestBaseAlgo definitions: these are constant enumerations and contain no executable for statements.\n- Macro definitions (_MHD_static_inline and MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_NON_SESSION): the inline-attribute macro is an alias for storage/attribute specifiers and the constant macro expands to a bitwise constant; neither expands to a for loop.\n\nBecause none of the provided code fragments contain a for statement or a macro that would expand to one, there are no fragments that need to be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 in the supplied code."
