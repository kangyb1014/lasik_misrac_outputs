  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for checking whether any controlling expression is invariant:\n\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: used as the upper bound in the for-loop controlling expression (i < CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE). If this macro can be 0 or constant in a way that makes the loop condition invariant, that would violate the MISRA requirement.\n\n- CPU_SETSIZE: used to compute mask_size_cpus (256 * CPU_SETSIZE). If CPU_SETSIZE is 0 or otherwise fixed to make downstream conditions invariant (e.g. allocation size zero), that affects whether later if-conditions/branches are ever entered.\n\n- cpuset_getaffinity: its return value is used directly in controlling expressions (if (0 == cpuset_getaffinity(...))). To decide if those if-expressions are invariant you must know whether the function can return different values at runtime.\n\n- CPU_COUNT: used to set ret from cur_mask (ret = CPU_COUNT(&cur_mask)); whether this can change ret (from initial -1) affects the truth of subsequent (0 >= ret) checks \u2014 so its behaviour/value range matters for invariance analysis.\n\n- CPU_COUNT_S: similarly used to set ret for the larger mask path; whether it can produce different values (and whether it interprets its first argument as bytes or number of CPUs, see MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS) affects whether subsequent (0 >= ret) tests are invariant.\n\n- CPU_ISSET: used inside the for-loop body to possibly increment ret. The capability of CPU_ISSET to return true for some i determines whether ret can change and thus whether later (0 >= ret) tests are invariant.\n\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: computes mask_size_bytes used as a size argument to cpuset_getaffinity and CPU_COUNT_S; if this expands to a compile-time constant with special properties it could affect invariance of subsequent runtime checks.\n\n- CPU_ALLOC: allocates p_mask; the condition (NULL != p_mask) controls a branch. Whether CPU_ALLOC can ever return non-NULL matters to determine if that branch (and its controlling expressions) can ever be reached and therefore whether any controlling expression is invariant.\n\n- CPU_FREE: used to free p_mask; included to understand lifetime of p_mask (though not a controlling expression itself), but necessary to reason about whether p_mask can be reused/observed and whether branch effects can change conditions.\n\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: controls which argument is passed to CPU_COUNT_S (mask_size_bytes vs mask_size_cpus). That changes semantics of CPU_COUNT_S call and thus whether ret can change \u2014 relevant to the (0 >= ret) checks.\n\n- HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S: preprocessor flags that determine which blocks of code exist at runtime. To analyse controlling-expression invariance we must know which branches are compiled in (code that is not compiled cannot influence invariance).\n\n- CPU_LEVEL_WHICH, CPU_WHICH_PID: macro/constant parameters passed to cpuset_getaffinity. While they are not controlling expressions themselves, their values may affect cpuset_getaffinity behaviour/return and so are needed to determine whether the cpuset_getaffinity-based conditions are variant.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any controlling expression in the function is invariant you must know the values/semantics of the loop bound macros, the behaviour and return variability of cpuset_getaffinity, the semantics of CPU_COUNT/CPU_COUNT_S/CPU_ISSET (which change ret), allocation macros (CPU_ALLOC/CPU_ALLOC_SIZE) that gate the p_mask branch, the compilation flags that include/exclude code paths, and the macro that changes CPU_COUNT_S argument meaning (MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS)."
