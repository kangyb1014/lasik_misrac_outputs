  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule about buffer/byte-range safety of string.h calls, we must inspect any symbols that can affect buffer sizes, memory writes, or that might themselves expand to use string.h routines: \n\n- cpuset_getaffinity: external/system call that writes into the provided buffer; need its prototype/semantics to know how many bytes it may write and whether the provided size argument prevents overruns.\n- cpuset_t: concrete type/layout used for stack variable cur_mask; sizeof(cur_mask) is passed to cpuset_getaffinity and must be known to ensure no out-of-bounds access.\n- CPU_COUNT: macro/function used on cur_mask; its implementation could read the cpuset bytes (possibly via mem* functions) \u2014 need its definition to ensure it does not access beyond cur_mask.\n- CPU_COUNT_S: alternative count function used on p_mask; its signature/behavior matters (some implementations take byte-count, others take CPU count) and its implementation could use string.h functions \u2014 must know which argument form is required and how it reads the buffer.\n- CPU_ISSET: macro/function used in the for-loop; need its implementation and how it indexes into a cpuset object to ensure the loop bound (CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE) does not cause out-of-bounds access.\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: loop upper bound; its numeric value must be compared to the bit/byte capacity of cur_mask to ensure the loop does not index past the actual storage.\n- CPU_SETSIZE: used to compute mask_size_cpus; its value affects CPU_ALLOC_SIZE and allocation size calculations.\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: macro that computes mask_size_bytes from number of CPUs; its definition is required to check that mask_size_bytes is the correct byte count and that CPU_COUNT_S (when expecting bytes) is called with the matching unit.\n- CPU_ALLOC / CPU_FREE: allocation/deallocation macros/functions used for p_mask; their implementation could perform initialization (e.g., memset) or copying that relies on sizes \u2014 need to ensure allocated buffer size matches subsequent cpuset_getaffinity usage and that no hidden string.h calls cause overrun.\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: compile-time macro that switches whether CPU_COUNT_S expects number-of-CPUs or number-of-bytes \u2014 critical to determine which argument is correct and whether CPU_COUNT_S may read beyond p_mask.\n- CPU_LEVEL_WHICH, CPU_WHICH_PID, id_t: constants/types passed to cpuset_getaffinity; while not string functions themselves, cpuset_getaffinity semantics can be platform-specific depending on these values, so their definitions help determine expected behavior/limits.\n- HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S: preprocessor feature macros that control which code paths are compiled. To analyze whether any string.h routine might be invoked (and with what buffer sizes), the exact active configuration must be known.\n\nIn short: to prove there are no out-of-bounds usages of any string.h routines (directly or inside macros/functions used here), we must see the definitions/implementations (or at least the exact prototypes/behaviors) of the cpuset APIs, the CPU_* macros/funcs, the allocation-size macro, and the compile-time switches that select code paths."
