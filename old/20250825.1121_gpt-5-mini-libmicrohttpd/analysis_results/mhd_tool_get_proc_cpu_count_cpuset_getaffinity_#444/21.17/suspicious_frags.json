  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and there are no calls to any of the Standard Library string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (no use of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that fall under the scope of Rule 21.17 and need investigation for accesses beyond the bounds of objects via those string.h functions.\n\nNotes on other constructs (not in scope for Rule 21.17):\n- The calls to cpuset_getaffinity(...) and the use of CPU_ALLOC/CPU_ALLOC_SIZE/CPU_FREE/CPU_COUNT_S manipulate buffers and sizes, but these are not functions from <string.h>. Although such calls should be checked for correct size/pointer use under other safety/robustness rules, they are not relevant to MISRA Rule 21.17 as given and thus are not reported here.\n- Conditional compilation (HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S) only affects which CPU-counting path is used; none of the compiled paths invoke string.h functions.\n\nBecause Rule 21.17 strictly concerns the listed <string.h> functions, and none are present in the target code, there are no suspicious fragments to report for this rule."
