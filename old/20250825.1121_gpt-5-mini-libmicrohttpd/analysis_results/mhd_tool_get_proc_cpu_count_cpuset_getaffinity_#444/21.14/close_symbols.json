  "explanation": "For MISRA Rule checking of memcmp-on-strings you must examine any functions or macros referenced by the target that could themselves call memcmp or perform string comparisons. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- cpuset_getaffinity: function called by the target. Its implementation could call library routines (including memcmp) \u2014 need its body to see if memcmp is used on NUL-terminated data.\n- cpuset_t: the data type populated/inspected by cpuset_getaffinity and used by CPU_* macros \u2014 needed to understand whether operations treat buffers as bitmaps or NUL-terminated strings.\n- CPU_COUNT: macro or function used to count CPUs in the cpuset; its implementation must be inspected for any use of memcmp on string data.\n- CPU_COUNT_S: alternative/counting function used with CPU_ALLOC; its implementation and the meaning of its size parameter must be known to rule out memcmp-on-strings.\n- CPU_ISSET: macro used to test bits in cpuset_t; need its definition to verify it operates on bitmaps (safe) and does not call memcmp on strings.\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: constant used in the fallback loop; need its value/definition to know whether the loop indexes are used with string-like buffers.\n- CPU_SETSIZE: size constant used to compute CPU_ALLOC size \u2014 knowing it clarifies whether CPU_ALLOC/CPU_COUNT_S treat their buffers as arrays/bitmaps rather than strings.\n- CPU_ALLOC / CPU_FREE: allocation/free helpers for cpuset storage; their implementations could wrap library helpers that might use memcmp \u2014 include to inspect transitive calls.\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: macro computing allocation byte size; needed to understand the buffer length passed into cpuset_getaffinity and CPU_COUNT_S and whether any string semantics are implied.\n- CPU_LEVEL_WHICH / CPU_WHICH_PID: constants passed to cpuset_getaffinity \u2014 include to get the exact cpuset_getaffinity signature and behavior from headers/implementation.\n- id_t: type used in the cpuset_getaffinity call \u2014 include to resolve prototype and ensure correct overload/ABI when inspecting cpuset_getaffinity implementation.\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: compilation macro that changes how CPU_COUNT_S is called (number-of-cpus vs byte-size). Necessary to know which prototype/semantic is used so you can inspect the correct implementation for memcmp use.\n- memcmp: the Standard Library function targeted by the MISRA rule. Include its symbol so the analyzer can detect direct or transitive uses of memcmp in any of the above implementations.\n\nProviding these symbols (their declarations/definitions/bodies or the headers that define them) lets the next agent determine if any code reachable from the target function invokes memcmp on NUL-terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
