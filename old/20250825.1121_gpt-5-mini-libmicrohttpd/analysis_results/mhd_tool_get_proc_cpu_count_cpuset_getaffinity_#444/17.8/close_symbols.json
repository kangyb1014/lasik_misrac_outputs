  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function violates the MISRA rule 'A function parameter should not be modified' we must inspect any called symbols or macros whose expansion or prototypes could modify parameters of the target function (or otherwise behave as if they modify parameters). Although the target function has no formal parameters, macros or inline functions used here could expand into code that assigns to implicit parameters or global objects in an unexpected way; the following symbols are therefore required:\n\n- cpuset_getaffinity: it's the external function called with &cur_mask and with p_mask; we need its prototype/definition to see whether it is a macro or inline that might alter any caller-supplied parameters or have side-effects that could be interpreted as modifying a parameter. Also ensures correct types of its arguments (id_t etc.).\n- CPU_COUNT: may be a macro or function that operates on its argument; its definition is required to confirm it does not assign to or rebind any function parameters (or mutate expressions in an unexpected way via side-effects).\n- CPU_ISSET: macro/function used in a loop condition; its expansion could contain side-effects or parameter modifications \u2014 need to verify.\n- CPU_COUNT_S: variant used with two different second-argument conventions (size in bytes vs cpu count). Its definition/signature must be known to confirm it doesn't modify caller parameters or the pointer arguments passed from the target.\n- CPU_ALLOC, CPU_FREE: allocator/free functions/macros; need to see whether any of these are macros that modify pointer arguments (unlikely but possible) or expand into constructs that could touch parameters.\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: macro that computes allocation size; inspect to ensure it is pure and does not mutate inputs.\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE and CPU_SETSIZE: macros used for bounds; definitions could be macros with side-effects \u2014 must confirm they do not modify parameters.\n- CPU_LEVEL_WHICH and CPU_WHICH_PID: constants/macros used as call args to cpuset_getaffinity; inspect in case they are complex macros with side-effects.\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: feature-test macro that changes which form of CPU_COUNT_S is used; needed to know the compiled variant and thus which signature/behavior to inspect.\n- HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S: preprocessor macros controlling compilation branches; required to know which code paths are actually compiled and therefore which symbols/definitions must be inspected.\n- cpuset_t: the type of cur_mask and p_mask; its definition is required to determine whether passing &cur_mask or p_mask could involve cast/macro magic that might mutate a parameter unexpectedly.\n- id_t: type used in the cpuset_getaffinity call; its definition/prototype context helps verify correct argument passing and any hidden macro behavior.\n\nIn short, these symbols cover all function calls, macros, types and preprocessor switches used inside the target function. Inspecting their definitions (or prototypes/macros) is sufficient to determine whether any expanded code or invoked routine performs modifications to function parameters (or introduces constructs that would violate the MISRA rule) when the target function is compiled."
