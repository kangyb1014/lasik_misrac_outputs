  "explanation": "I found no pointer declarations in this function that could or should be made to point to a const-qualified type. All pointer uses are to objects that are written to (so cannot be const):\n\n- &cur_mask is passed to cpuset_getaffinity which fills/updates the mask, so cur_mask must be modifiable.\n- p_mask is returned by CPU_ALLOC and then passed to cpuset_getaffinity (which writes into the buffer) before being passed to CPU_COUNT_S/CPU_FREE; because it is an output buffer it must be non-const.\n- CPU_ISSET/CPU_COUNT/CPU_COUNT_S operate on masks that have been (or may be) modified by cpuset_getaffinity; even if some of these macros/functions accept const pointers for read-only access, the buffer is earlier written to, so the local pointer cannot be declared to point-to-const.\n- No other pointer variables or pointer parameters are present in this code fragment (only size_t and integer values), and casts like (id_t)-1 involve integers, not pointers.\n\nGiven these facts, there are no code fragments here that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible)."
