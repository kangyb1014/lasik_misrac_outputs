The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: the for-loop's second clause is `i < CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE`. You must see the macro/definition to ensure it is a pure compile-time constant or an expression without side effects or aliases to objects that might be modified in the loop body. If it expands to an expression with side effects or to an object that can be modified in the loop body the loop may violate MISRA.\n\nCPU_ISSET: used inside the loop body. You must inspect its definition (macro or function) to ensure it does not modify the loop counter `i` or any other object used in the for-clause, and that it has no persistent side effects. MISRA requires that functions called from the loop body be considered part of the loop behaviour.\n\nCPU_SETSIZE: CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE may be defined in terms of CPU_SETSIZE; include it so you can fully evaluate CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE and verify it is side\u2011effect free and not subject to modification in the loop body.\n\nHAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY and HAVE_CPU_COUNT: these preprocessor configuration symbols control whether the for-loop is present (the loop is inside #if defined(HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY) and only used when HAVE_CPU_COUNT is not defined). To determine whether the for-loop actually participates in the compiled function (and thus whether the MISRA check applies), the analyzer needs these build-time macros/definitions."
