  "explanation": "I inspected pointer declarations and uses in the function and selected fragments where non-const pointer types are declared or passed around and where pointers are converted/used in ways that could be made to point to const-qualified types. I did not mark other code fragments because:\n- The parameter 'realm' is already const-qualified (const char *realm), so it complies with the rule.\n- The local array 'char nonce2[...]' is an internal, modifiable buffer (not a pointer parameter) and is intentionally writable; Rule 8.13 targets pointer declarations that could be const-qualified, not local arrays used as mutable storage.\n- Calls to functions like MHD_get_master(...) are uses of returned values; there are no local pointer declarations for those that could be made const in this snippet.\n- Uses of timestamp1/timestamp2 and integer temporaries (base1..base4, etc.) are non-pointer entities and not relevant to Rule 8.13.\n- The pointer-to-integer cast involving nonce2 is included above because it uses a pointer in a context where const qualification of the pointed-to type may be relevant; other casts in the function do not involve pointer variables that could be const-qualified.\n\nIf further context (declarations of calculate_add_nonce, digest_* APIs, or whether connection and da are modified by callees) is provided, the investigation can determine which of the flagged non-const pointer parameters can be safely changed to point to const-qualified types."
