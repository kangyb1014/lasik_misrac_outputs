  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. The reported violation is valid: the code uses the macros _MHD_ROTL32 and _MHD_ROTR32 which expand to compiler-specific builtins (__builtin_rotateleft32 and __builtin_rotateright32). These __builtin_* identifiers are non\u2011standard compiler extensions (documented as GCC/Clang builtins) and therefore constitute use of language/compiler extensions. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (Language extensions should not be used) this is a violation unless the use is explicitly allowed/guarded by project configuration. The correct remediation is to replace the builtin rotations with a standard-C implementation (e.g. ((x << n) | (x >> (32 - n))) with well\u2011defined operand widths) or hide the builtin behind a portability/configuration macro offering a portable fallback."
