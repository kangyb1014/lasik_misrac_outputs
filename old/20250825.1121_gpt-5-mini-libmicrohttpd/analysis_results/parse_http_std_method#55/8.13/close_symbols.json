  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer in parse_http_std_method should be const-qualified (MISRA: prefer const wherever possible) we must inspect the types and usages that affect constness:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: needed to determine whether the connection parameter could be a pointer-to-const. The function writes to connection->rq.http_mthd, so the definition shows whether such writes actually modify the pointed-to object and thus whether connection must be non-const.\n\n- MHD_Connection.rq (type of rq member): the concrete type of rq and whether it is an object or pointer and whether its members are declared const affects whether connection could be const-qualified.\n\n- rq.http_mthd (declaration / type): the function assigns to this field. We need the field's declaration (type and qualifiers) to confirm that a write occurs and thus that connection cannot be a pointer-to-const.\n\n- enum/typedef MHD_HTTP_MTHD and its constants: to understand the type being stored in http_mthd and whether any conversions or casts occur that could affect constness checking.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_* definitions: these are the right-hand operands of memcmp and of the length macro. Knowing whether they are string literals (const char[]) or some non-const char* (or macro that casts away const) matters to verify that comparing them with const char *method is valid and that no implicit non-const usage occurs.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: this macro/function is used in the comparisons. If it performs casts or manipulations that remove const qualifiers, that could violate the rule; its definition is needed to check for such casts.\n\n- memcmp prototype: memcmp takes const void* parameters. Confirming its prototype shows that passing method (const char*) does not force a non-const conversion.\n\n- mhd_assert: ensure the assert macro does not perform any operation that modifies the pointer or casts away const (e.g., a debug helper that casts types). If it does, it could affect whether method or connection should be const.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine whether any pointer in parse_http_std_method could (or should) be declared with stronger const qualification and whether the code performs any casts or writes that prevent such qualification."
