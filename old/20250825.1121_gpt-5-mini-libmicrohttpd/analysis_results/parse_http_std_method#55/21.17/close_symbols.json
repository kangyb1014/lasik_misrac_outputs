  "explanation": "- get_request_line_inner: caller that produces the method pointer and the len argument. You must inspect its code to determine the origin, lifetime and actual length of the buffer pointed to by method (and whether len can exceed that buffer). Without this you cannot decide whether memcmp(m, ..., len) can read past the method buffer.\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: macro used to compare literal-method lengths. You must see its expansion (e.g. sizeof(x)-1 or other) to confirm the integer compared to len and to understand the intended length used for the static strings.\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_POST, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_PUT, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_DELETE, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_CONNECT, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_OPTIONS, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_TRACE: definitions (the actual char arrays/strings and their sizes). These are the second-argument buffers to memcmp; you must know their storage and size so you can verify that memcmp(..., len) will not read past those static strings.\n- memcmp (from <string.h>): semantic/contract: memcmp reads exactly the number of bytes given by the length argument from both pointers (it does not stop at NUL). Confirming this is necessary to reason about potential out-of-bounds reads on both operands.\n- struct MHD_Connection: definition (including the rq sub-structure and any buffers in the connection object). Needed to see whether the method pointer may alias parts of the connection, whether method points into a transient buffer, and to ensure assignments to rq.http_mthd do not affect the buffers used in comparison.\n- mhd_assert: its definition/behavior (runtime abort vs no-op in non-debug builds). If mhd_assert is compiled out, the asserted non-NULL and non-zero-len assumptions may not hold; this affects whether memcmp can be called with invalid pointers or zero/invalid lengths.\n\nThese symbols together let the next analyzer determine the provenance and valid size of both memcmp operands and the effective length used, which is necessary to check the MISRA rule forbidding out-of-bounds string-handling calls."
