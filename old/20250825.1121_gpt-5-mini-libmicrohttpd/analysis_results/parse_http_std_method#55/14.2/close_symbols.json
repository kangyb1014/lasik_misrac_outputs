Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For evaluating MISRA rule about well-formed for loops we must ensure no macros or called functions introduce loops or side effects that would affect loop counters/flags. Each listed symbol is required for these checks:\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: This macro is used in every comparison; it could expand to code or expressions (possibly complex) that might include loops or side effects. We need its definition to be sure it is a simple pure expression (e.g. sizeof(...) - 1) and not a loop or side-effecting construct.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_* (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE): These identifiers are used as the macro argument to MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ and as memcmp targets. We must confirm they are simple string literals (or static consts) and not function-like macros or constructs that introduce loops or side effects.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_MTHD_* (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, OTHER): These are the assignment targets for connection->rq.http_mthd. We need their definitions to ensure they are plain enum/constant values (no macros with side effects) so the assignment cannot violate the \u201conly modify loop counter in third clause\u201d part of the rule if such assignment were inside a for.\n\n- memcmp: It is invoked from this function. Although parse_http_std_method contains no for loop, MISRA requires considering behaviour of any functions called within a for statement. We must confirm memcmp is a standard function (or a macro wrapper) and that its implementation or macro expansion does not itself contain a for loop or modify objects that could be loop counters in an enclosing for.\n\n- mhd_assert: This macro/function is called at the top. It could expand to code with loops or side effects (e.g. logging macros). We need its definition to rule out hidden loops/side effects that would affect loop well-formedness.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): The function assigns to connection->rq.http_mthd. We must inspect the structure and the rq/http_mthd members to ensure those are ordinary fields (not macros or accessors) and that the assignment is a simple store with no hidden side effects.\n\n- type/definition of connection->rq and its http_mthd member: For the same reason as above, confirm that writing to this member is an ordinary assignment (no invoked functions, no overloaded/complex macros) that cannot violate the rule if used inside a for loop.\n\nIn short: verify all macros and called symbols used in the function expand to simple, side-effect-free expressions or ordinary assignments (and that memcmp/mhd_assert are not macro/wrapper forms introducing loops). If they are simple, parse_http_std_method contains no for loops and thus cannot violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule; if any expand to loops/side effects, those definitions must be inspected to determine compliance."
