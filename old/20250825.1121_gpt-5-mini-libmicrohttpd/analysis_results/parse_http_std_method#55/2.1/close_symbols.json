  "explanation": "- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: the macro expands to the compile-time length used in each length comparison; knowing its definition is required to prove whether any length-comparison branch can ever be true (or is always false => unreachable).\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_* (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE): the actual string literals (or definitions) compared by memcmp; their contents determine whether memcmp branches are reachable for any input.\n- memcmp: standard comparison semantics are assumed, but having the prototype/semantics available is necessary to reason precisely about byte comparisons and possible overlapping/aliasing effects.\n- mhd_assert: the assert macro may abort or be a no-op depending on build configuration; its definition is needed to know if the NULL/zero checks act as runtime guards that affect reachability reasoning.\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition, including member rq and rq.http_mthd): required to understand the effect of assignments and whether any aliasing/side-effects or unusual types could affect control flow or make assignments unreachable/invalid.\n- MHD_HTTP_MTHD_* (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, OTHER): target enum/constant values assigned to connection->rq.http_mthd; needed to confirm assignments are valid and to see if any assignment paths are impossible due to type/enum constraints.\n- get_request_line_inner and get_request_line: these callers (from the provided static call graph) are needed to determine whether parse_http_std_method is reachable from program entry points. To satisfy the MISRA rule about unreachable code you must consider the call chain; if these callers are themselves never reachable, parse_http_std_method could be unreachable even if its internal branches are conditionally reachable.\n\nProviding these symbols (macro/string definitions, struct/enum definitions, assert implementation, and the immediate callers) lets an analyst determine whether any branch inside parse_http_std_method or the function itself is provably impossible (unreachable) in the built project."
