  "explanation": "Every listed symbol is needed to determine whether the if/else controlling expressions in parse_http_std_method can be invariant (always true or always false) under realistic compilation/usage:\n\n- memcmp: The second conjunct of each if uses 0 == memcmp(m, <method>, len). Knowing memcmp's semantics (it compares the runtime bytes pointed by m and the literal) is essential to decide if that expression can ever vary.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: This macro provides the length value compared against the runtime len. You must inspect its definition (compile\u2011time constant vs. computed at runtime) to know whether the left-hand comparison (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(...) == len) is a compile\u2011time invariant.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_* (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE): These are the string constants used both by MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ and memcmp. You need their definitions (literal content/length) to reason about the comparisons and whether memcmp can return zero for given len.\n\n- mhd_assert: The function calls mhd_assert(NULL != m) and mhd_assert(0 != len). Depending on how mhd_assert is defined (active check, abort, or a no-op in release builds) these checks may or may not affect the set of reachable runtime values for m and len; this influences whether a controlling expression could be considered invariant.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection and connection->rq (rq member layout): parse_http_std_method assigns to connection->rq.http_mthd. To understand whether any of the controlling expressions are influenced by side effects or aliases in connection/rq, and to fully understand the code context (and whether assignments or accesses could make expressions invariant), the structure definition and layout are needed.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_MTHD_* enumerators (MHD_HTTP_MTHD_GET, HEAD, ..., OTHER): While these appear only on assignment RHSs, their presence confirms the intended finite set of outcomes; knowing them helps a reviewer ensure the conditional chain is meaningful and not optimized away or replaced by other macros that might affect invariant status.\n\n- get_request_line_inner and get_request_line: These callers supply the method pointer and len arguments. To conclude that a controlling expression inside parse_http_std_method is (not) invariant in the whole program, one must inspect call sites to see whether len or method are always a particular constant at call time (e.g., the caller always passes a compile\u2011time constant or always the same string), which could make the comparisons constant. Including callers lets the analyzer determine whether the controlling expressions can be treated as invariant across actual usages.\n\n(Other obvious C builtins like NULL and size_t are assumed known; the listed symbols are those whose definitions or caller behavior must be inspected to decide compliance with the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions.)"
