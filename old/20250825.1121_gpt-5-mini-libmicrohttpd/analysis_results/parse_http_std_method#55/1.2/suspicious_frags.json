  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __label__, or statement-expression ({ ... }) constructs.\n- The code uses only standard C constructs: static function, pointer declarations (const char *const), size_t, standard library function memcmp, and ordinary if/else chains.\n- The Doxygen-style comment (/**< ... */) is a comment only and not a language extension.\n- The visible macros for method strings are plain string-literal defines and are standard C.\n\nNote about macros not shown: mhd_assert and MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ are invoked but their definitions were not included. If those macros expand to compiler-specific extensions, those expansions would need to be inspected. However, based on the supplied code itself there is no explicit use of any documented compiler language extension to report."
