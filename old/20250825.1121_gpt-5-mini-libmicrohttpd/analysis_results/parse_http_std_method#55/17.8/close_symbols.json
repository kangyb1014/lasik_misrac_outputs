  "explanation": "To determine whether parse_http_std_method violates the MISRA rule 'A function parameter should not be modified' we must be sure none of the symbols/macros used by the function expand to code that assigns to or otherwise modifies the parameter variables (connection, method, len) rather than only reading them or modifying the object pointed to by connection (which is allowed). Explaination per symbol:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition, and the types of rq and rq.http_mthd): The function writes connection->rq.http_mthd. To assess compliance we must confirm that this is a write to the object pointed to by the pointer parameter (permitted) and not an assignment that rebinds or modifies the pointer parameter itself via some macro/overloaded operator. Also check whether rq or http_mthd are macros or have side effects.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function definition): The two mhd_assert calls reference the parameters (m and len). If mhd_assert is a macro it might expand to code with side effects (assignments, pointer modifications). We need its definition to ensure it only evaluates/read expressions or converts to (void)0 in non-debug builds and does not modify any parameter.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (macro definition): This macro is called repeatedly with constant identifiers. If it expands to an expression with side effects or that modifies any parameter, that could violate the rule. We need its definition to confirm it is a pure compile-time/side-effect-free operation (e.g. sizeof or strlen on a literal).\n\n- MHD_HTTP_METHOD_* (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE) (definitions): They are used as the second operand to memcmp and as arguments to MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_. We must verify they are ordinary string literal/constants (no side effects) and not macros that perform assignments or otherwise alter parameters.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_MTHD_* (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, OTHER) (definitions): These are the values assigned to connection->rq.http_mthd. We must verify they are simple constants (enum values or macros without side effects) so the assignment is a plain write to the pointee, not an operation that would modify the parameter itself.\n\n- memcmp (prototype / declaration): memcmp is used to compare the method bytes. We need its prototype to confirm it takes const void * and does not modify the memory pointed to by its arguments nor the pointer parameter itself. Also to rule out any local redefinition of memcmp as a macro or function with side effects.\n\nCollectively, these definitions allow an analyzer to determine whether any macro expansion or called function mutates the parameter variables (connection, method, len) themselves. If all listed symbols expand to side-effect-free constants/expressions and memcmp/mhd_assert do not assign to parameters, then parse_http_std_method does not violate the MISRA rule (writes are only to the object pointed to by 'connection')."
