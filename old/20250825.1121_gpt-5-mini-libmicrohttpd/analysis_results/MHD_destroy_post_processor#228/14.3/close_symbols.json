Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "struct MHD_PostProcessor: needed to know the exact types and qualifiers of the fields accessed here (state, xbuf_pos, nested_boundary, have). Whether these fields are volatile/const, signed/unsigned, or have other attributes determines whether the controlling expressions can be treated as compile\u2011time or run\u2011time invariants.\n\nPP_ProcessValue, PP_Done, PP_Init: the enumerator (or macro) values used in comparisons with pp->state. Their definitions are required to see if any comparison is actually between two compile\u2011time constants (which would make the controlling expression invariant) or if they are normal enum values compared with a run\u2011time field.\n\nNE_none: the enumerator (or macro) assigned to pp->have. Knowing its definition and type is required to understand side effects and whether the assignment or the value could affect subsequent control flow or be used to detect invariance concerns elsewhere.\n\npost_process_urlencoded: this function is called before the key compound controlling expression that inspects pp->xbuf_pos and pp->state. Its implementation (and whether it modifies pp->state, pp->xbuf_pos, pp->nested_boundary or other fields) is essential to decide if the later controlling expression can change at run time (i.e., is not invariant).\n\nprocess_value: called (directly or indirectly) by post_process_urlencoded and likely responsible for updating pp->state and buffer position. Its behaviour is important to determine whether pp->state and pp->xbuf_pos can change during the call path, which affects whether the controlling expressions are invariant.\n\n(These symbols provide the minimal information needed to determine whether the if/conditional expressions in MHD_destroy_post_processor depend on run\u2011time state or are constant/invariant.)"
