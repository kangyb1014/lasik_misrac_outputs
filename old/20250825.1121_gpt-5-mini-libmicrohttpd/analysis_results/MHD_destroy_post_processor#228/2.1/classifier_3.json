  "scenario": "The conditional free is reachable. When MHD_destroy_post_processor is called with a non-NULL pp, execution continues past earlier checks and returns, and the if (NULL != pp->nested_boundary) free(pp->nested_boundary); statement will be executed whenever pp->nested_boundary is non-NULL. There is no path that makes that statement permanently unreachable, so Rule 2.1 is not violated."
