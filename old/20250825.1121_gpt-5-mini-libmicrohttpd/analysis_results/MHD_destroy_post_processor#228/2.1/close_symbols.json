  "explanation": "For deciding whether any code in MHD_destroy_post_processor is unreachable you must know: \n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (definition): needed to know the types/representations and possible ranges of fields accessed (state, xbuf_pos, have, nested_boundary). Reachability of the if/else branches depends on those field types/values (e.g. whether xbuf_pos can ever be >0, whether nested_boundary can be non-NULL).\n- PP_ProcessValue, PP_Done, PP_Init: the enum/defines used in comparisons against pp->state. You must know their values and semantics to determine whether the PP_ProcessValue test or the (state != PP_Done && state != PP_Init) test can be true/false in any reachable state.\n- post_process_urlencoded (implementation): the function is invoked conditionally; if it can unconditionally not return (e.g. abort, longjmp, or call __builtin_unreachable on the taken path) then the code after that call in MHD_destroy_post_processor may be unreachable. You need its body to see under which conditions it returns.\n- free_unmarked (implementation): same reason as above \u2014 if this callee can be non-returning or has side effects that change reachability assumptions, that affects whether subsequent statements in the target function are actually reachable.\n- MHD_unescape_plus, MHD_http_unescape, process_value (implementations): these are called (directly or indirectly) by post_process_urlencoded; they might contain aborts, longjmps, or calls to __builtin_unreachable that make a return path impossible. Their implementations are needed to determine whether post_process_urlencoded can ever return to the caller.\n- __builtin_unreachable (usage sites): this compiler intrinsic appears in the post_process_urlencoded call graph. You must examine where and how it is used (and whether its invocation is unconditional along the path taken from MHD_destroy_post_processor) because its execution implies code after the call is unreachable.\n- NE_none: the constant used to assign pp->have \u2014 while not usually affecting reachability, include it to understand any enum assignment semantics or side effects and to fully model the state transitions in the struct.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions allows a precise analysis of whether any branch or statement in MHD_destroy_post_processor can never be executed (i.e. would be unreachable) due to constant values, field ranges, or non-returning callees."
