  "scenario": "Not violated. Both branches of the conditional are reachable depending on pp->xbuf_pos and pp->state. For example: if pp->xbuf_pos == 0 and pp->state == PP_Init then the condition is false and ret = MHD_YES is executed; if pp->xbuf_pos == 0 and pp->state == PP_ProcessValue (or any state not equal to PP_Done or PP_Init) then the condition is true and ret = MHD_NO is executed. There is no constant expression forcing one branch to be permanently unreachable."
