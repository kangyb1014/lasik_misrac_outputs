  "explanation": "No other lines in this function call any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), nor do they pass buffers/lengths to external APIs that are string-library functions. The remaining code performs pointer/null checks, simple enum/state tests, assignments, frees, and returns; these do not by themselves implicate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The post_process_urlencoded(...) call is the only place where a byte buffer (the literal \"\\n\" with length 1) is handed to a string-processing routine and therefore must be inspected to ensure the callee does not read beyond the provided buffer/length or assume a NUL-terminated string. Other fragments (free, free_unmarked, field accesses, enum checks, returning) are not string.h usages and so do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
