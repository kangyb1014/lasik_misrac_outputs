  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C string/buffer bounds you must inspect any code that reads from or writes to character buffers or calls string.h functions. The target function itself delegates possible string/buffer manipulations to other functions and uses fields of the post-processor structure; therefore you need:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): to know the exact buffer objects, their types and sizes (e.g. xbuf pointer/array, xbuf_pos, any xbuf_size or capacity fields, nested_boundary pointer). Without the concrete buffer fields and sizes you cannot determine whether memory copies or writes in callees stay within bounds.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded (implementation): the target calls this when PP_ProcessValue is active. This function likely appends/terminates/parses input into pp's buffers and may call string/memory functions. Its body must be inspected for memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc. and for how it updates xbuf_pos and checks capacities.\n\n- MHD_unescape_plus and MHD_http_unescape (implementations): post_process_urlencoded calls these unescape helpers. They may write into destination buffers or perform in-place edits using string/memory functions; their behavior determines whether they can write past buffer limits.\n\n- process_value (implementation): post_process_urlencoded calls process_value to finalize parsed values; it may copy or terminate strings into pp buffers or allocate/modify memory and could use string.h routines that must be checked for bounds.\n\n- free_unmarked (implementation): called before freeing pp; this routine may clear or overwrite internal buffers (e.g. with memset or similar). To ensure no out-of-bounds writes occur when cleaning up, its implementation must be inspected.\n\n- PP_ProcessValue, PP_Done, PP_Init (enum/defines): the state values control whether post_process_urlencoded is invoked and how parsing was interrupted. Knowing these constants and the state machine semantics is necessary to determine which buffer paths execute and whether partial/unterminated data could lead to out-of-bounds string ops.\n\n- NE_none (enum/define): while just an assignment here, the meaning of 'have' flags may affect how other code (e.g. free_unmarked or process_value) behaves; include to understand any conditional cleanup that may affect buffer access.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any standard string.h functions used by the target or its callees can access beyond object bounds you must examine the pp structure (buffers and capacities) and the implementations of post_process_urlencoded and the functions it calls (MHD_unescape_plus, MHD_http_unescape, process_value) plus free_unmarked and the listed state/flag constants that determine control flow."
