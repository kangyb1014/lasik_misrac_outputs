  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The call free_unmarked(pp) is appropriate because the helper likely modifies/frees internal members of *pp (and pp itself is later freed), so the pointer must not be const-qualified. This conforms to Rule 8.13 (use const only when the pointed-to object is not modified). (Note: a violation would exist if free_unmarked neither modified nor freed *pp but its parameter were non-const \u2014 in that case the parameter should be a pointer to const.)"
