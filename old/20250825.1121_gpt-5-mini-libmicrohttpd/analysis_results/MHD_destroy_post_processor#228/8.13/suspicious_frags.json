  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either do not introduce or pass pointer types that could/should be const-qualified, or they clearly modify or release the pointed-to object (so const would be inappropriate). Examples: the NULL check and early return (if (NULL == pp) return MHD_YES;) and the state checks/branching only examine fields; the assignment pp->have = NE_none modifies object state (const would be incompatible); the conditional and enum logic manipulate or inspect non-pointer members and do not affect pointer qualification. These operations therefore do not indicate a missing const qualification and do not need further review under Rule 8.13."
