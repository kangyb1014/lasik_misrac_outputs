  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The parameter pp refers to an object that is modified (pp->have = NE_none; free_unmarked(pp); possible freeing of pp->nested_boundary) and finally deallocated with free(pp). MISRA Rule 8.13 requires const qualification when the pointed-to object is not modified; here the object is modified and destroyed, so it must not be const. A true violation would be a function that only reads from its pointer parameter but declares it as a non-const (e.g. void f(struct S *p) that only inspects p instead of taking const struct S *p)."
