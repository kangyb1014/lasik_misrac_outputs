  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in typical use: the call free(pp->nested_boundary) requires a pointer to modifiable storage (free has prototype void free(void *)), so pp->nested_boundary is expected to be a non-const pointer and therefore does not violate Rule 8.13. A concrete violation scenario would be if pp->nested_boundary is declared as a non-const pointer but actually points to storage that is never modified and could (and should) be declared const (e.g. it always points to constant text or read-only data). In that case the pointer declaration should be const-qualified and the current declaration would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
