  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const whenever possible you must know whether any pointer parameters or object members are actually modified (which would prohibit adding const) or whether they are passed to functions expecting non-const pointers (which may signal a violation). Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): The function dereferences and writes to pp (pp->state, pp->have, pp->xbuf_pos, free(pp->nested_boundary), free(pp)). The complete struct definition shows the exact types of these members (and whether any members are themselves pointers) and whether the function performs modifying operations that prevent making the pp parameter a pointer-to-const.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded (prototype/signature): The call post_process_urlencoded(pp, \"\\n\", 1) passes a string literal as the second argument. To determine if a const qualifier should be used you must know whether this function's parameter is declared as char * or const char *. If it takes char * then passing a literal can highlight a pointer-to-non-const issue; if it accepts const char * then the literal is fine and may indicate the function already follows the const rule.\n\n- free_unmarked (prototype/signature): The function calls free_unmarked(pp). If free_unmarked accepts a non-const pointer (struct MHD_PostProcessor *) it indicates pp is modified/inspected in a non-const way; if it accepted const, that would affect whether pp itself could be const. You need the signature to decide if making pp a pointer-to-const is possible.\n\n- PP_ProcessValue, PP_Done, PP_Init (definitions): These are compared against pp->state. Knowing the type (enum or macro) and whether state comparisons reflect read-only usage or state changes helps decide if pp->state is modified elsewhere in this function or must remain mutable.\n\n- pp->xbuf_pos (type/definition within struct MHD_PostProcessor): The code reads pp->xbuf_pos to decide return value. Its type (e.g., integer vs pointer) determines whether the expression constitutes modification and whether any pointer members are involved that might require const qualification.\n\n- pp->have and NE_none (definitions/types): The function assigns pp->have = NE_none; knowing the type of have and NE_none confirms that this function writes to pp, which prevents making pp a pointer-to-const; include these symbols to justify that pp must be non-const.\n\n- pp->nested_boundary (type/definition within struct MHD_PostProcessor): The function frees pp->nested_boundary. Its declared type (char *, const char *, or other) matters: if nested_boundary is declared as char * but actually points at string literals or const data, that could indicate a const-correctness issue. Also knowing its type shows whether freeing it is compatible with const qualification.\n\nThese symbols give the necessary type and prototype information to determine which pointers in MHD_destroy_post_processor could or could not be declared to point to const types in accordance with the MISRA rule."
