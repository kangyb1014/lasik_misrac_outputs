  "explanation": "I examined the function for actions that would modify the parameter variable pp itself (e.g. assignments to pp, pp = ..., taking action that changes the pointer value). There are no such operations: pp is only compared (if (NULL == pp)), dereferenced to read or write members (pp->state, pp->xbuf_pos, pp->have, pp->nested_boundary) \u2014 writing to the object pointed to is allowed by the rule \u2014 passed to other functions (post_process_urlencoded, free_unmarked) and finally passed to free(). None of these modify the pointer parameter variable itself. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8; no further investigation of other fragments in this function is necessary."
