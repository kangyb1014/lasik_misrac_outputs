  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d we must be sure the local parameter variable pp is never assigned to inside MHD_destroy_post_processor (and not implicitly modified via macro expansion). Each listed symbol is needed for the following reasons:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full type definition): confirms pp is a single-level pointer (struct MHD_PostProcessor *), shows the types of members (state, xbuf_pos, have, nested_boundary) and whether any of those member names are macros or have unusual types that could affect whether pp itself is modified. Also needed to determine whether nested_boundary is a pointer type (so free(nested_boundary) is operating on a member, not the parameter variable).\n\n- post_process_urlencoded (declaration/definition): pp is passed to this routine. We must inspect its prototype/definition to ensure it is not a macro that expands into code that assigns to the caller\u2019s pp variable or that it does not take, e.g., a pointer-to-pointer allowing side-effects on the caller\u2019s pp identifier via macro tricks.\n\n- free_unmarked (declaration/definition): called with pp. We must verify its prototype/definition to ensure it cannot modify the caller\u2019s pp variable (e.g., by being a macro or taking a pointer-to-pointer) \u2014 even if it manipulates the object pointed to, that is allowed by MISRA; changing the parameter variable itself is not.\n\n- free (stdlib.h): free is used on pp and pp->nested_boundary. Verify that in this build environment free is the normal library function (not redefined as a macro that could perform an assignment to pp in the calling scope).\n\n- PP_ProcessValue, PP_Done, PP_Init (state enum/defines): these identifiers are used in comparisons with pp->state. We need their definitions to ensure they are plain constants/enumerators (not macros expanding to code that could modify pp via some token-pasting or unusual side-effecting construct).\n\n- MHD_Result and MHD_YES / MHD_NO (result enum/defines): used to set and return ret. Confirm these are simple enumerators/constants and not macros that could alter pp via expansion.\n\n- NE_none (enumerator/define): used in assignment to pp->have. Confirm NE_none is a normal constant (not a macro that could expand into code that assigns to pp).\n\n- NULL (macro): used in pointer comparisons. Ensure NULL is the usual constant (not a macro that could expand to code altering pp).\n\nIn short, inspect the struct and the called functions/macros to ensure none are implemented as macros or as functions that could (directly or indirectly via pointer-to-pointer) reassign the local parameter variable pp. The above symbols are the minimal set required to conclude whether the parameter variable pp is modified (violating MISRA) versus merely the object it points to being altered (permitted)."
