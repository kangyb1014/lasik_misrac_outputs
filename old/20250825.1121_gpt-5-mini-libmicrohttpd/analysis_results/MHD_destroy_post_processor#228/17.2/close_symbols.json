  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_destroy_post_processor calls itself (directly or indirectly), the analyzer must inspect every function it invokes and those functions' transitive callees to see if any path returns to MHD_destroy_post_processor. The listed symbols are required for that transitive-call analysis:\n\n- post_process_urlencoded: Direct callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor. Its implementation may call other functions that could (directly or transitively) call back into MHD_destroy_post_processor, so its body must be inspected.\n\n- free_unmarked: Direct callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor. Even though the provided static graph shows no callees, its definition must be checked to ensure it does not (transitively) call MHD_destroy_post_processor.\n\n- MHD_unescape_plus: Callee of post_process_urlencoded. It must be inspected because it is on the transitive callee chain and could call (directly or indirectly) MHD_destroy_post_processor.\n\n- MHD_http_unescape: Callee of post_process_urlencoded. Same reason as above \u2014 it is on the transitive call path and must be checked for any call paths back to MHD_destroy_post_processor.\n\n- process_value: Callee of post_process_urlencoded. Must be inspected for any call paths that could eventually invoke MHD_destroy_post_processor.\n\n(Notes: __builtin_unreachable is a compiler intrinsic and not relevant to call-cycle detection. Standard library free is called in MHD_destroy_post_processor but cannot create recursion to MHD_destroy_post_processor in typical code; only user-defined callees and their transitive callees need inspection for the MISRA recursion rule.)"
