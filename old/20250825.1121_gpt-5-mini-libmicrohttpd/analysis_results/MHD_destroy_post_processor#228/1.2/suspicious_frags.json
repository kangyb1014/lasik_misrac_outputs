  "explanation": "Only the macro using GCC/Clang attribute syntax (__attribute__((visibility(\"default\")))) and its use on the function declaration are potentially compiler-specific language extensions. The rest of the code uses standard C constructs and standard library types: enums, struct definitions, size_t, uint64_t (from stdint.h), bool (from stdbool.h), pointer operations, free(), and normal control flow. No other __attribute__ uses, inline asm, Microsoft-specific pragmas, or other known compiler-specific extensions appear in the provided code, so they do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
