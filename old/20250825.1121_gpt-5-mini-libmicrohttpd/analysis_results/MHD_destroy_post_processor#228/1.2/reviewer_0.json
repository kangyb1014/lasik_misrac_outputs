  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. The _MHD_EXTERN macro expands to __attribute__((visibility(\"default\"))) which is a GCC/Clang compiler-specific attribute (documented as an extension). MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 prohibits use of language/compiler extensions; therefore the function declaration using that macro violates Rule 1.2."
