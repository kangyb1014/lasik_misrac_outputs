  "explanation": "For a strict check of MISRA C rule on language extensions we must inspect any macros, types or declarations used in the target function signature and body because they may expand to or carry compiler extensions (attributes, builtin calls, calling\u2011convention specifiers, __declspec, __attribute__, inline assembly, __builtin_*, etc.). Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- _MHD_EXTERN: This macro decorates the function declaration/definition. It commonly expands to compiler-specific storage/linkage annotations (e.g. __declspec(dllexport), __attribute__((visibility(...))), extern \"C\", calling-convention qualifiers). Its expansion must be examined to detect any language extensions.\n\n- enum MHD_Result: The return type; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not use extension constructs (e.g. bit\u2011fields in enums, compiler attributes attached to the enum type or its members).\n\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO: Enum constants used as return values. Their definitions are in the enum; verify no extension annotations on the constants or unusual macro redefinitions.\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: The function operates on members of this struct (.state, .xbuf_pos, .have, .nested_boundary). The struct definition may contain compiler extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bitfields, anonymous structs/unions, attributes on members, non\u2011standard pragmas). The member types also must be known to see if any typedef uses extensions.\n\n- PP_ProcessValue, PP_Done, PP_Init: Identifiers used to inspect pp->state. They are likely enum or macro constants; their definitions must be checked for attributes or non\u2011standard constructs.\n\n- NE_none: Assigned to pp->have; must inspect its definition and the underlying type of .have (enum, macro) for extensions.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded (prototype/definition): Although the function is called (and appears in the call graph), its declaration may carry attributes (e.g. attribute((noreturn)), calling conventions, or use of builtins/macros). The prototype/definition should be inspected to detect extension use that affects the call site or API surface used by the target function.\n\n- free_unmarked (prototype/definition): Called before freeing pp; its declaration/definition might use attributes or compiler extensions that are part of the visible API of the target function.\n\n- NULL: The NULL macro definition should be checked (rare, but some platforms redefine NULL in non-standard ways). This is usually standard, but include it for completeness when hunting for language extensions used via macros.\n\n- free: The standard library free declaration is normally standard, but on some platforms it may be macro-wrapped or annotated with attributes (e.g. __attribute__((nonnull))). Checking the declaration ensures no unexpected compiler extension is used at the call site.\n\nCollecting the above symbol definitions (from the headers/source where the project defines them) is sufficient to determine whether the target function itself, or its visible declarations, use language extensions disallowed by MISRA C."
