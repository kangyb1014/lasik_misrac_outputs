  "explanation": "I did not mark the other code fragments for investigation because they affect control flow or observable behaviour and therefore are unlikely to be dead code: the initial NULL check and early return (if (NULL == pp) return MHD_YES;) is a guard that changes program behaviour; the PP_ProcessValue state test determines whether remaining input must be processed (and so cannot be assumed dead without analysing post-processing); the computation of ret based on pp->xbuf_pos and pp->state directly determines the function's return value; the function signature, local variable declaration (enum MHD_Result ret;) and the final return (return ret;) are all used and affect behaviour. The suspicious fragments above were chosen because they perform operations that may have no effect on external behaviour (e.g. writing into a structure immediately prior to freeing it, or freeing resources that may have already been released), or are function calls whose effects on final observable behaviour are not clear from this snippet and therefore warrant investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
