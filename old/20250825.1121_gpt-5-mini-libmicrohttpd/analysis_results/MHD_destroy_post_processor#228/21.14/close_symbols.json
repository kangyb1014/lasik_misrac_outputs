  "explanation": "post_process_urlencoded \u2014 Direct callee from MHD_destroy_post_processor. Any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings inside this function would make the target violate the MISRA rule, so the function body/prototype is required for analysis.\n\nMHD_unescape_plus \u2014 Called by post_process_urlencoded. If this helper uses memcmp (or calls others that do) to compare null-terminated strings, it must be inspected.\n\nMHD_http_unescape \u2014 Called by post_process_urlencoded. Same reason: memcmp usage here (direct or indirect) could cause a violation.\n\nprocess_value \u2014 Called by post_process_urlencoded. It may perform comparisons of parsed values (likely strings); its implementation is needed to check for memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\nfree_unmarked \u2014 Direct callee of MHD_destroy_post_processor. Although less likely, it could contain memcmp usage; include its implementation to be sure the overall cleanup path does not call memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nstruct MHD_PostProcessor (definition) \u2014 The target inspects and frees members of this struct (state, xbuf_pos, nested_boundary, etc.). Knowing which members are char* or other string types and whether they are NUL-terminated is necessary to determine whether any memcmp usages in callees operate on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nnested_boundary (member type/definition) \u2014 This member is explicitly freed in the target. If nested_boundary is a NUL-terminated string, any memcmp usage elsewhere that compares it must be checked. Provide the precise type/ownership/termination semantics.\n\nmemcmp \u2014 The rule concerns use of the Standard Library function memcmp. Include the symbol so the analyzer can find any direct or indirect calls to memcmp within the above functions (or in functions they call) and determine whether the arguments are NUL-terminated strings.\n\n(Only these symbols are requested because they cover the direct call chain from the target and the data types touched by the target; inspecting their implementations and the memcmp symbol is sufficient to decide whether any memcmp usage compares null-terminated strings.)"
