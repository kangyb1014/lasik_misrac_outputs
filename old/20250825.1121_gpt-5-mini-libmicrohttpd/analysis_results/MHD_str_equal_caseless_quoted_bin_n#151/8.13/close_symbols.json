  "explanation": "charsequalcaseless: The target function calls this helper to compare characters. To decide whether any pointer should be const-qualified for MISRA compliance you must inspect charsequalcaseless's prototype and implementation to see (a) what parameter types it expects (value vs pointer), (b) whether it takes or returns non-const pointers or performs casts that drop const, or (c) whether it modifies the data passed. Any of those could require removing constness or indicate a const-qualification problem.\n\nisasciiupper: According to the static call graph, charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper. You need isasciiupper's declaration/definition (or macro expansion) to check its parameter types and any casts or pointer operations it performs. If isasciiupper (or an underlying macro it uses) expects or manipulates non-const pointer types or performs casts that defeat const qualifiers, that could propagate a const-correctness issue back to the target function via charsequalcaseless."
