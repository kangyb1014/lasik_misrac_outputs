  "explanation": "charsequalcaseless: This function is used directly in a controlling expression (if (! charsequalcaseless(quoted[i], unquoted[j]))). To decide whether that controlling expression is invariant you must see the definition of charsequalcaseless (is it a macro/inline that always returns the same value for all inputs, does it have side effects, does it depend only on compile-time constants, etc.).\n\nisasciiupper: charsequalcaseless (per the call graph) calls isasciiupper. If isasciiupper is a macro or an implementation-defined routine that can reduce charsequalcaseless to an invariant expression (or otherwise affect its behavior or side effects), you must inspect its definition as well to determine whether the controlling expression remains variable."
