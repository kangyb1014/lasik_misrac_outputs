  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found regarding Rule 17.2. The function MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n contains no call to itself. The only function calls it makes are to charsequalcaseless and isasciiupper; the provided definitions for these functions do not call MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n (they are simple, non-recursive helpers). There are no function pointers, callbacks, or macros in the shown code that could expand to an indirect call back to MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n. Therefore there is no direct or indirect recursion to investigate."
