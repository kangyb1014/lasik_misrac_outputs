  "explanation": "To prove absence of direct or indirect recursion you must examine every function called (transitively) by the target. \"charsequalcaseless\" is a direct callee of MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n and its body may call back to the target or call other functions that do. \"isasciiupper\" is a callee of charsequalcaseless and therefore part of the target's transitive call chain; its implementation (or macro expansion) must be checked to ensure it does not call, directly or indirectly, MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n. Provide the full definitions (or expanded inline/macro bodies) of these symbols to perform the recursion check."
