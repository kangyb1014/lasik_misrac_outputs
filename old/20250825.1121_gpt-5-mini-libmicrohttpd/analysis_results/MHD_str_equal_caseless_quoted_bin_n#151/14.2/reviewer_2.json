First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n.\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n (const char *quoted,\n                                     size_t quoted_len,\n                                     const char *unquoted,\n                                     size_t unquoted_len)\n{\n  size_t i;\n  size_t j;\n  if (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2)\n    return false;\n\n  j = 0;\n  for (i = 0; quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j; ++i, ++j)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[i])\n    {\n      i++; /* Advance to the next character */\n      if (quoted_len == i)\n        return false; /* No character after escaping backslash */\n    }\n    if (! charsequalcaseless (quoted[i], unquoted[j]))\n      return false; /* Different characters */\n  }\n  if ((quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j))\n    return false; /* The strings have different length */\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nViolation: the for loop uses two loop counters (i and j) in the iteration-expression (++i, ++j) and the loop body modifies i with i++;. This breaches Rule 14.2: a loop counter shall not be modified in the loop body and there shall be only one loop counter. Additionally the loop condition (quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j) uses i which is then modified in the body, violating the requirement that the second clause not use objects modified in the loop body.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n:\n_MHD_static_inline bool\ncharsequalcaseless (const char c1, const char c2)\n{\n  return ( (c1 == c2) ||\n           (isasciiupper (c1) ?\n            ((c1 - 'A' + 'a') == c2) :\n            ((c1 == (c2 - 'A' + 'a')) && isasciiupper (c2))) );\n}\n...\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nisasciiupper (char c)\n{\n  return (c >= 'A') && (c <= 'Z');\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The for statement is not well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 for multiple reasons: (1) The loop uses two loop counters (i and j) in the iteration-expression (++i, ++j). Rule 14.2 requires there be only one loop counter. (2) The loop body modifies i with i++; Rule 14.2 requires that the loop counter not be modified in the loop body. (3) Because there are effectively two counters, the second clause (quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j) is not the permitted simple use of a single loop counter (and the rule forbids using objects that are modified in the loop body other than the single loop counter). The call to charsequalcaseless does not mitigate these violations. Therefore agent A\u2019s claim of a Rule 14.2 violation is correct."
