First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n.\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n (const char *quoted,\n                                     size_t quoted_len,\n                                     const char *unquoted,\n                                     size_t unquoted_len)\n{\n  size_t i;\n  size_t j;\n  if (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2)\n    return false;\n\n  j = 0;\n  for (i = 0; quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j; ++i, ++j)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[i])\n    {\n      i++; /* Advance to the next character */\n      if (quoted_len == i)\n        return false; /* No character after escaping backslash */\n    }\n    if (! charsequalcaseless (quoted[i], unquoted[j]))\n      return false; /* Different characters */\n  }\n  if ((quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j))\n    return false; /* The strings have different length */\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe for statement uses two loop counters (i and j) and modifies both in the third clause (++i, ++j). MISRA 14.2 requires a single loop counter; the second clause must use only that counter (and optional boolean flags). Furthermore the loop body modifies i (i++ when a backslash is seen), which violates the requirement that the loop counter shall not be modified in the loop body. Therefore the for statement is not well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n:\n_MHD_static_inline bool\ncharsequalcaseless (const char c1, const char c2)\n{\n  return ( (c1 == c2) ||\n           (isasciiupper (c1) ?\n            ((c1 - 'A' + 'a') == c2) :\n            ((c1 == (c2 - 'A' + 'a')) && isasciiupper (c2))) );\n}\n...\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nisasciiupper (char c)\n{\n  return (c >= 'A') && (c <= 'Z');\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The for statement is not well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 for multiple reasons: (1) There are two loop counters (i and j) in effect \u2014 the loop header increments both (++i, ++j) which violates the requirement that there shall be only one loop counter in a for loop and that the third clause shall modify only that loop counter. (2) The second clause uses both i and j (quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j), whereas the second clause is allowed to reference only the loop counter (and optional boolean loop-control flags). (3) The loop body modifies i (i++ when a backslash is seen), which violates the prohibition on modifying the loop counter inside the loop body. Any of these points means the for loop fails to meet Rule 14.2; together they confirm the reported violation."
