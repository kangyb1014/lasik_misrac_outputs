Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) charsequalcaseless\n- It is called from inside the for loop body. MISRA requires the behaviour of the loop body to be analysed including any called functions to determine whether the second- and third-clause objects (here i and j and the other objects used in the loop condition) are modified by the body. To decide compliance you must inspect charsequalcaseless's prototype and implementation to verify it has no persistent side effects and does not modify any objects used in the for-clause (notably i, j, quoted_len, unquoted_len or any global objects those clauses rely on). Also confirm it does not itself rely on or modify loop control flags.\n\n2) isasciiupper\n- This is a transitive callee of charsequalcaseless (per the call graph). MISRA mandates analysing the behaviour of any functions called within the for statement, transitively. You must inspect isasciiupper to ensure it is side-effect free and cannot modify any of the loop counters/objects used in the for clauses (or any global state that would affect the loop-clause expressions).\n\nNo other symbols are required for deciding this MISRA rule: the loop header and body show explicit modifications of i and j and an extra modification of i inside the body, and the only called function is charsequalcaseless (and its callee isasciiupper) which must be inspected for side effects to complete the analysis."
