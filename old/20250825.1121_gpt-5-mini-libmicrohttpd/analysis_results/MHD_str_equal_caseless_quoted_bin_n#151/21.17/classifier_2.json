  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the code guards accesses to quoted[]. The loop condition (quoted_len > i) ensures the initial access quoted[i] is in bounds; when a backslash is seen the code increments i and immediately checks if i == quoted_len and returns false if so, preventing any subsequent access to quoted[i] beyond the buffer. Also no <string.h> functions are used here. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated."
