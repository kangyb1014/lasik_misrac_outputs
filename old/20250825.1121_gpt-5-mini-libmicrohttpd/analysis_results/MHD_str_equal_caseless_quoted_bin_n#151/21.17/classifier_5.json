  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment only compares the indices i and j against the provided lengths and does not dereference any pointers or call any <string.h> functions. The loop and the in-loop checks ensure that any accesses to quoted[i] and unquoted[j] occur only when i < quoted_len and j < unquoted_len, so this comparison cannot cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses and therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
