  "explanation": "charsequalcaseless: The target function delegates character-comparison to this helper. To determine bounds-safety (MISRA rule about string.h usage and accesses beyond object bounds) you must see its implementation/prototype to know whether it reads only the single characters passed, or whether it calls any <string.h> functions (e.g. strcmp, memcmp, strlen) or otherwise accesses more bytes (for example by treating inputs as NUL-terminated). If it reads beyond the single character or assumes NUL termination, the target function may indirectly cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nisasciiupper: The call graph shows charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper. You need the definition or macro expansion of isasciiupper to ensure it does not perform unexpected memory accesses or call other library routines that could read beyond the provided character data. Also check whether it invokes ctype functions without proper unsigned-char casting (which can be undefined behavior for negative char values).\n\nisupper, tolower, toupper: These are representative ctype functions that isasciiupper might call (or macros it might expand to). Their presence is included so the analyser can inspect how characters are passed (are they cast to unsigned char before calling?) and confirm they do not implicitly depend on NUL-terminated strings or call any <string.h> functions. If any of these are used incorrectly (e.g. calling isupper on a signed char without casting), it can produce undefined behavior; if any helper uses string.h routines, that must be examined for out-of-bounds access.\n\nNote: size_t and bool are standard types used in the function signature; their declarations (stddef.h / stdbool.h) are not required to assess string.h-related out-of-bounds behavior, so they are not listed above. The focus here is to obtain implementations/prototypes/macros for the helper functions that could perform additional memory accesses or call string.h functions."
