  "explanation": "Only the listed fragments perform indexed accesses through the pointer parameters (quoted[...] and unquoted[...]) or change the index variables in a way that affects bounds checking. These accesses and the manual increment of i inside the loop can affect whether subsequent indexing is in-bounds and therefore must be investigated for potential out-of-bounds accesses relative to quoted_len and unquoted_len. The rest of the code does not call any <string.h> functions (the MISRA Rule 21.17 focus) nor does it perform pointer indexing on the function parameters: variable declarations, the initial length comparison (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2), the return statements, and the helper functions charsequalcaseless and isasciiupper operate on char values rather than pointer-indexed memory and therefore do not raise concerns under Rule 21.17. Hence they do not need to be investigated for this specific rule."
