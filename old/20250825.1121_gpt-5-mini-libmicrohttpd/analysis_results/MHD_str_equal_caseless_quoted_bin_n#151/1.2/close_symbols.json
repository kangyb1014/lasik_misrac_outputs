  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n uses compiler language extensions you must inspect the code it calls and the types it uses: \n\n- charsequalcaseless: this callee may be a function or a macro and its implementation could use compiler-specific extensions (attributes, builtins, inline assembly, typeof, nested functions, statement-expressions, etc.). You need its declaration/definition or macro expansion to see any such uses. \n\n- isasciiupper: the static graph shows this is called (transitively). It is commonly a macro wrapper and could hide extensions; its definition is required to check for non\u2011standard constructs. \n\n- stdbool.h / bool typedef: the function uses the identifier 'bool'. Verify whether this is the standard _Bool/type from stdbool.h or some compiler-specific substitute or macro (which could be an extension). \n\n- stddef.h / size_t typedef: similarly, confirm 'size_t' comes from the standard header and not a compiler extension/type alias.\n\n- Any headers/macros pulled in by the above: macros in those headers can introduce extensions (for example wrappers around builtin functions). You must examine those headers/macros to find extension tokens.\n\n- Explicit compiler\u2011extension tokens/constructs: look for __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, asm, typeof, GCC nested functions or statement\u2011expression constructs ({ ... }) in the above symbols. These are the concrete markers of language extensions that must be reported.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions/macros/headers) allows the next analysis agent to reliably detect any compiler-specific language extensions used by the target function or its callees."
