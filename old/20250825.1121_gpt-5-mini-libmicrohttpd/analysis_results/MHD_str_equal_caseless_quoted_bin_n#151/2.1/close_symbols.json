  "explanation": "1) charsequalcaseless: The target function calls this symbol for each character comparison. To determine whether any statements in the target function are unreachable you must know whether charsequalcaseless is a normal function, a macro that can inject control-flow statements (return, goto, break), or is annotated/implemented as non-returning (or otherwise has side-effects that change i/j or perform longjmp/exit). The exact implementation/expansion also reveals if it always returns a constant for all inputs (which could make later code unreachable). Therefore include its prototype, source/definition and any macro/header that defines it.\n\n2) isasciiupper: The static call graph shows charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper. If isasciiupper is a macro or has unusual semantics (or is non-standard/overridden) that affect how charsequalcaseless behaves (for example causing it to always take a particular branch, or to be non-returning when mis-implemented), that can indirectly make code in the target function unreachable. Include its declaration/definition or macro expansion and the header that defines it.\n\nNote: For a complete unreachable-code analysis you should inspect the headers/macros where these symbols are defined (to capture macro expansions) and any attributes (e.g., noreturn) or calls (exit/longjmp) they use. Standard type definitions (size_t, bool) are not sufficient alone to assess reachability and are therefore not listed as additional close symbols here."
