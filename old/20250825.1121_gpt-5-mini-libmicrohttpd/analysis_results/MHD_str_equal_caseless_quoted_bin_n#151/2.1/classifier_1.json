  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the provided code fragment. The return statement is executed whenever charsequalcaseless(quoted[i], unquoted[j]) evaluates to false, so it is reachable in normal operation. A concrete violation scenario would be if charsequalcaseless is implemented or preprocessed to a constant true (for example via a macro: #define charsequalcaseless(a,b) (1) or an inline/function that is provably always true). In that hypothetical case the if condition would never be true and the return false; statement would be unreachable, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
