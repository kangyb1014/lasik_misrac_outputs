  "explanation": "I examined the provided function MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n and the related inline helpers (charsequalcaseless, isasciiupper). There are no calls to memcmp (nor to any wrapper that would be expected to call memcmp) in the shown code. The string comparison is performed character-by-character with explicit length checks and escape handling, so no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings is present. Therefore, there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If additional files or functions exist beyond the supplied snippets, those should be searched for any memcmp usage, as this analysis is limited to the provided code."
