  "explanation": "1) charsequalcaseless \u2014 Direct callee of the target function. You must examine its implementation to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls memcmp (or otherwise uses memcmp to compare strings). If charsequalcaseless uses memcmp on character buffers that may be NUL-terminated, that would trigger the MISRA rule.\n\n2) isasciiupper \u2014 Shown in the static call graph as a callee of charsequalcaseless. To fully analyze charsequalcaseless you must also inspect any functions it calls; if any of those call memcmp (or perform string comparisons via wrappers), that affects the MISRA check. isasciiupper is the immediate dependent in the graph, so include it.\n\n3) memcmp \u2014 The Standard Library function referenced by the MISRA rule. Include this symbol to detect any direct or indirect uses (including via wrappers/macros) in charsequalcaseless or its callees and to inspect how it is used (whether on null-terminated strings)."
