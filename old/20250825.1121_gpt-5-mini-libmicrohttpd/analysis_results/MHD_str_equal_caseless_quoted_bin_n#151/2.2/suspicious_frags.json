  "explanation": "I have listed all code fragments that could plausibly contain operations that are executed yet redundant or whose removal might not change behavior (these should be investigated for possible dead code or redundant checks). Other parts of the function that were not listed are not suspicious for Rule 2.2 for the following reasons: initializations (size_t i; size_t j; j = 0; i = 0 in the loop) are necessary state setup (initialization is explicitly excluded from dead-code candidates per the rule notes); the loop body increments (++i, ++j) and the final return true implement the essential matching logic and are required for correct behaviour; comments and obvious control-flow constructs are not executable operations that could be dead; and each early-return that I did not include (for example the explicit return true at the end) directly affects the function result so its removal would change behaviour. The fragments I selected cover conditional checks, branch logic and helper functions that contain conditional expressions which may be redundant or otherwise candidates for dead code; those should be examined further."
