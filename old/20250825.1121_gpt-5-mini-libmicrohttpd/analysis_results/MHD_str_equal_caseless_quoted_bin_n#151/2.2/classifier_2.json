  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n (const char *quoted,\n                                     size_t quoted_len,\n                                     const char *unquoted,\n                                     size_t unquoted_len)\n{\n  size_t i;\n  size_t j;\n  if (unquoted_len < quoted_len / 2)\n    return false;\n\n  j = 0;\n  for (i = 0; quoted_len > i && unquoted_len > j; ++i, ++j)\n  {\n    if ('\\\\' == quoted[i])\n    {\n      i++; /* Advance to the next character */\n      if (quoted_len == i)\n        return false; /* No character after escaping backslash */\n    }\n    if (! charsequalcaseless (quoted[i], unquoted[j]))\n      return false; /* Different characters */\n  }\n  if ((quoted_len != i) || (unquoted_len != j))\n    return false; /* The strings have different length */\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n:\n_MHD_static_inline bool\ncharsequalcaseless (const char c1, const char c2)\n{\n  return ( (c1 == c2) ||\n           (isasciiupper (c1) ?\n            ((c1 - 'A' + 'a') == c2) :\n            ((c1 == (c2 - 'A' + 'a')) && isasciiupper (c2))) );\n}\n...\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nisasciiupper (char c)\n{\n  return (c >= 'A') && (c <= 'Z');\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (! charsequalcaseless (quoted[i], unquoted[j]))\n      return false; /* Different characters */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The if-statement invoking charsequalcaseless(quoted[i], unquoted[j]) is reachable and semantics-dependent on the inputs: when characters differ it returns false and thus determines the function result. Removing this check would change observable behaviour (mismatched characters would no longer cause an early false return), so this is not dead code."
