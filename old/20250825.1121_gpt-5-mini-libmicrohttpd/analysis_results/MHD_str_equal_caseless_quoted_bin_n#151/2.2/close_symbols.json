  "explanation": "For deciding whether code in MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n is dead (MISRA: \"A project shall not contain dead code\") you need to reason about both internal control-flow and whether the function (and the statements inside it) can ever affect program behaviour. The listed symbols/information are required for that analysis:\n\n- charsequalcaseless: The target calls this function. You must inspect its implementation to determine if it has side-effects, if it can always return a fixed result, or if it contains always-taken/never-taken branches that would make parts of the caller redundant. If charsequalcaseless were a no-op or constant-returning function, removing some operations in the caller could be behaviour-preserving (dead).\n\n- isasciiupper: charsequalcaseless calls this helper (per the call graph). Its behaviour may influence charsequalcaseless outcomes (and any side effects). To correctly judge whether comparisons in the target can ever fail or always succeed, you need the full callee chain behaviour.\n\n- all callers (direct call-sites) of MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n across the project: If the function is never called, it is dead code. Determining that requires enumerating every direct call-site in the codebase. The static call graph fragment shows no callers, but you must verify project-wide.\n\n- all places that take the address of MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n (function-pointer tables, callback registries, global variables): A function can be reachable by pointer use even if there are no direct calls. If its address is recorded in a callback table or otherwise used indirectly, the function is not dead. You must inspect these symbols/data structures to decide reachability.\n\n- linkage/visibility information for MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n (static/extern/visibility attributes and symbol-table / object-file exports): Whether the function has internal linkage (static) or is externally visible affects dead-code determination. A static function with no callers in its translation unit is dead; an externally visible function might be used by other modules or at link time, so you need symbol visibility info.\n\n- translation unit / source file that defines MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n (to check static/inline qualifiers): The file-level qualifiers and surrounding code (e.g., conditional compilation) can affect whether the function is compiled, inlined, or reachable. This is needed to determine whether the function body can be removed safely.\n\n- build configuration and linker map / exported-symbol lists: The build system and linker output show whether the function is retained in the final binary, whether it is stripped, or whether it is referenced by other linked modules (including external libraries). This is essential to conclude if removing the function or statements inside it changes program behaviour.\n\nCollecting these symbols and artefacts lets the next analyst determine both (a) whether any statements inside the function are executed at runtime and (b) whether their removal would change observable behaviour (i.e., whether the function is ever reachable or has side effects), which is required to assess compliance with the MISRA dead-code rule."
