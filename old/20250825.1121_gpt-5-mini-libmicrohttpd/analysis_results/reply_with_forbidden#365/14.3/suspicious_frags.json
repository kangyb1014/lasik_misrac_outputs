  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. The rule concerns invariant controlling expressions (loops/switches/etc.). In the provided code there are no loop or switch controlling expressions that are constant/invariant:\n\n- There are no for, while, or do-while loops in reply_with_forbidden or in the provided helper functions that use a compile-time invariant condition (no for(;;), while(1), while(constant), or do { } while(constant) patterns).\n- The only conditional statements are if checks whose controlling expressions depend on runtime values or function results: (NULL == resp), ((NULL == buffer) && (size > 0)), (MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN == size) \u2014 size is a runtime parameter, (NULL == r) after allocation, and (! MHD_mutex_init_(&r->mutex)) which depends on the mutex init result. None of these are compile-time invariants.\n- The static constant page_content_len is a compile-time constant but it is not used as a controlling expression; it is an initializer for a constant, which is outside the scope of Rule 14.3.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#if SIZEOF_SIZE_T >= SIZEOF_UINT64_T) are handled by the preprocessor and are not C-language controlling expressions covered by Rule 14.3.\n\nTherefore there are no suspicious controlling expressions to report for investigation under Rule 14.3."
