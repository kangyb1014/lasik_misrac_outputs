  "explanation": "I inspected all pointer usages in the function. The static page_content is already const-qualified, so it is not a violation. The resp pointer is later passed to and destroyed by MHD_destroy_response(), so it must refer to a mutable response object and should not be made const. There are no other pointer declarations or usages in this function that could be promoted to point to const-qualified types. The three fragments listed above are the only places where const-qualification might be being discarded or where a non-const pointer parameter may be used with data that is const; they should be investigated further against the API prototypes to determine whether const qualifiers are being lost or could be applied."
