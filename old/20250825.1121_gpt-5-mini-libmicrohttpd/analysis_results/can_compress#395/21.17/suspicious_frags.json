  "explanation": "I flagged the calls that use <string.h> operations (strcmp, strstr, and subsequent indexing relative to the returned pointer) because they operate on the pointer returned by MHD_lookup_connection_value and could result in out-of-bounds accesses if that returned object is not a properly NUL-terminated region or if assumptions about surrounding characters do not hold. Other code fragments were not flagged because they do not invoke string.h functions or they are already guarded/safe: the NULL check on ae prevents dereferencing a NULL pointer before string usage; the wrapper MHD_lookup_connection_value uses a guarded strlen(key) ((NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen(key)) and in this usage the key is a string literal; uses of strlen on string literals (e.g. \"deflate\") are compile-time/constant and do not cause bounds issues; simple return statements and macro definitions are irrelevant to Rule 21.17. Therefore only the listed string-handling-related fragments require further investigation."
