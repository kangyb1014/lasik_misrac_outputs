  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only code fragments that contain for statements need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The target function can_compress contains no for loops, so it is not relevant. The other provided code elements (function prototypes, enum/define declarations, and the body of MHD_lookup_connection_value which calls MHD_lookup_connection_value_n but contains no for loops) do not require inspection for this rule. The two for-loop fragments above are the only occurrences of for statements in the supplied code and therefore should be examined for compliance with Rule 14.2 (loop-counter initialization, loop-test side-effects, update expression, single loop counter, and that the loop counter is not modified within the loop body or by called functions)."
