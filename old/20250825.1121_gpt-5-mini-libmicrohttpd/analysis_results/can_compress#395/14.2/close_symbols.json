The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol:\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value: can_compress calls this function directly. To determine whether any for-loop behaviour relevant to MISRA (e.g. loop counters, side-effects, objects modified in loop bodies) is induced by called code, you must inspect this called function\u2019s implementation.\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: MHD_lookup_connection_value calls this symbol (per the static call graph). It must be inspected because it is part of the callee chain and could contain for loops or side effects relevant to the MISRA rule.\n- strcmp, strstr, strlen: standard-library functions used in can_compress. Although can_compress itself contains no for loop, the MISRA rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of a for loop body if a for loop were present. To be thorough you must know whether these functions have side effects that could affect loop-counter rules or use/modify objects used by a surrounding for loop.\n- struct MHD_Connection: the concrete layout/semantics of this type may expose objects accessed or modified (via pointers inside it) that a for loop in can_compress might reference. Knowing the definition helps determine whether any object used in a loop header/body is modified elsewhere.\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_ACCEPT_ENCODING: constants/macros passed to MHD_lookup_connection_value. Their definitions can affect how the lookup behaves (and therefore whether called code traverses/updates objects) and so are necessary to inspect the callee behaviour.\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: the return enumeration and its values are used by can_compress; while not directly related to for-loop formation, their definitions are required to fully understand control flow and whether any implicit conversions or macros expand into code with for loops or side effects.\n- NULL: the null macro is tested in can_compress. Its canonical definition is needed to ensure the NULL tests are standard and have no unexpected side-effects in this codebase.\n\nNotes: can_compress contains no for statement itself. The only symbols needed to decide MISRA compliance are the direct callees and any functions they invoke (because MISRA treats called-function behaviour as part of a for-loop body). The list above collects the direct call chain and the standard/string functions referenced, plus the relevant types/constants used by the call, so a subsequent agent can inspect those implementations/definitions for any for-loops or side-effects that could cause a MISRA C for-loop violation."
