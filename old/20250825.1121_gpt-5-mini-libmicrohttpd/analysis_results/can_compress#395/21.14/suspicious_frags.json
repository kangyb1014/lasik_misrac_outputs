  "explanation": "No direct use of memcmp appears in the provided code fragments. The code uses strcmp, strstr and strlen (e.g. if (0 == strcmp(ae, \"*\")), de = strstr(ae, \"deflate\"), de[strlen(\"deflate\")] == '\\0'), which are appropriate for null-terminated string operations and are not violations of Rule 21.14. The only called helper that might conceivably use memcmp internally is MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, but it is invoked with an explicit length (key_size) and is intended for binary/length-based comparison rather than comparing null-terminated strings; therefore, based on the shown code there is no evidence of memcmp being used to compare null-terminated strings. If the implementation of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (not provided) itself used memcmp on null-terminated strings, that implementation should be inspected, but that implementation is not part of the supplied code. Consequently there are no suspicious fragments in the given code that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
