  "explanation": "No loops (for, while, do-while) appear in can_compress, so there are no controlling expressions that could be invariant in the sense targeted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. All conditional tests in the function are runtime-dependent and therefore not invariant:\n\n- if (NULL == ae) \u2014 depends on the return value of MHD_lookup_connection_value called at runtime.\n- if (0 == strcmp (ae, \"*\")) \u2014 depends on the contents of ae (runtime string comparison).\n- if (NULL == de) \u2014 depends on the result of strstr called with ae at runtime.\n- the compound if that checks surrounding characters of de and de[strlen(\"deflate\")] \u2014 depends on pointer de and the runtime contents of the string; strlen(\"deflate\") is a function call here (not an integer constant expression) and the character checks depend on the runtime buffer contents.\n\nBecause none of these are invariant constant controlling expressions, and because there are no loop conditions to which the rule (and its exceptions) would apply, there are no code fragments that need investigation under Rule 14.3 in the provided code."
