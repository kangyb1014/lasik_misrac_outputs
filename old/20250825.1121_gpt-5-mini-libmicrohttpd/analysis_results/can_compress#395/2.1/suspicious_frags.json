  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Every statement and return in can_compress can be executed for some valid input path: - The initial NULL check on ae may return MHD_NO; - The strcmp(\"*\") branch may return MHD_YES for the literal \"*\" value; - The strstr result de can be NULL (leading to MHD_NO) or non-NULL (continuing execution); - The compound conditional that inspects de[-1] and de[strlen(\"deflate\")] is reachable when de points to an occurrence of \"deflate\" inside the ae string, and the use of short-circuit operators ensures de[-1] is only accessed when de != ae. There are no statements following unconditional returns that would never be reached, no dead code sections, and no infinite loops or other constructs that would render code unreachable. Therefore, under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code), there are no suspicious fragments to investigate in the supplied code."
