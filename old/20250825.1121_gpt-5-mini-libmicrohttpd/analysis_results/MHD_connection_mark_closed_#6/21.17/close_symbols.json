  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_connection_mark_closed_ can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses via any string.h routines, the analyzer must know the exact types and code paths that this function touches: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection: required to see the types of fields accessed (daemon, socket_fd, state, event_loop_info). In particular, if any of these fields are pointer(s) to character buffers or contain offsets/lengths that could be passed to string.h functions, their layout and types must be known. \n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: required to know the type of daemon->options (bitfield/integer vs pointer) and any other fields that might be involved in conditional logic or passed to helper functions that could use string functions. \n\n- MHD_USE_TURBO and MHD_USE_TLS: the bitmask macros/constants determine the control flow (whether shutdown or TLS shutdown is invoked). Their definitions (type/values) are needed to reason about which call paths are possible. \n\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown: this calle\u00e9 is invoked conditionally; its prototype and implementation must be inspected because it may itself call string.h functions (memcpy/strlen/etc.) or manipulate buffers derived from the connection/daemon. Any string usage there would make the target function transitively relevant for the MISRA rule. \n\n- shutdown: the POSIX/system call invoked on socket_fd is part of the executed path. Its prototype and the semantics of the socket_fd field (from struct MHD_Connection) are needed to ensure no string functions are invoked via this call (normally none), and to confirm socket_fd is a valid integer FD. \n\n- SHUT_WR: the constant passed to shutdown; included for completeness to confirm correct use of shutdown and that no unexpected macro expands to string operations. \n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: the compile-time macro controls whether the TLS branch is present. The presence/absence of this macro changes whether MHD_tls_connection_shutdown is reachable and thus must be analyzed. \n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP: the state/event constants assigned at the end\u2014need to know their definitions in case their assignment invokes macros or inline code that could call string functions or otherwise affect buffers.\n\nThese symbols cover the data layout, control flow choices, and the only callees reachable from MHD_connection_mark_closed_. Inspecting their definitions/implementations is sufficient to determine whether any string.h functions are reachable from the target function and whether they could access beyond object bounds."
