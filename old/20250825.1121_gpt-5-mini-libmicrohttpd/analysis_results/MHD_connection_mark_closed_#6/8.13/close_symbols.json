  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: needed to see the declaration and const-qualification of the connection->daemon field and of socket_fd, state and event_loop_info fields. The core MISRA question is whether the daemon pointer (and other pointers/fields) could/should be declared const; that can only be decided from the struct member types and any const qualifiers on them.\n- struct MHD_Daemon: needed to see the declaration and const-qualification of the daemon object and its options field. The code reads daemon->options; knowing the daemon type shows whether the object is already const-qualified or whether it is ever modified (affecting whether a const pointer is appropriate).\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown: prototype/signature is required to determine whether this function requires a mutable (non-const) MHD_Connection* or could accept a const pointer. If it accepts non-const, that constrains whether connection (or pointers to it) can be const.\n- MHD_USE_TURBO and MHD_USE_TLS: definitions (macros/enum values) show the type/usage of daemon->options and help confirm that options is an integer flag field (relevant to whether daemon needs to be mutable).\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP: definitions (enum constants or macros) and the types of the state/event_loop_info members are needed to confirm that the function writes to these fields (so connection must be non-const) and to see their types/qualifiers.\n- SHUT_WR: definition (macro/constant) and the shutdown prototype help confirm the use of socket_fd and that shutdown does not require pointer mutability; also to check whether socket_fd is used in a manner requiring it to be non-const.\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: compile-time option that gates different control flow. Its presence/absence can change which functions/paths are compiled; the analysis must consider both configurations to decide const-qualification needs.\n- shutdown: prototype (POSIX int shutdown(int,int)) to confirm that no pointer-to-object mutability is required by this call.\n\nIncluding these symbols (types, macros and function prototypes) lets the analyst determine whether pointers involved in the function are already const-qualified, whether they could/should be declared const, and whether any callees or assignments in this function require non-const access (i.e. whether the code violates the MISRA rule)."
