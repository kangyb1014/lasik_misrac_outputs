  "explanation": "To decide whether MHD_connection_mark_closed_ violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we must be sure the parameter variable 'connection' itself is not being changed (reassigned) by any code or macro used in the function. The listed symbols are needed because:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: we must see the exact member declarations to confirm 'connection' is a pointer parameter (not a macro) and to verify that access expressions like connection->daemon, connection->socket_fd, connection->state and connection->event_loop_info are plain field accesses (not macro expansions that could reassign the parameter variable).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: the daemon->options expression must be inspected in context (type, and whether 'daemon' is a simple field) to ensure no macro hides/rewrites that expression into something that could modify the parameter.\n\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown: this identifier may be a function or a macro. If it is a macro its expansion could contain code that assigns to the parameter variable 'connection' (e.g. reassigning it). We must inspect its definition to rule out modification of the parameter identifier.\n\n- shutdown: typically a library function, but could be a macro in some builds. Verify it cannot reassign or otherwise modify the parameter variable.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: a compile-time macro controlling the conditional. If defined as something unusual (e.g. a macro that expands to code), it could change semantics. Verify it's a plain preprocessor symbol used only for conditional compilation.\n\n- MHD_USE_TURBO and MHD_USE_TLS: these are macros/constants used in bitwise tests on daemon->options. If either is a macro with side effects or function-like behavior, it could change semantics; check they are simple bit masks/constants.\n\n- SHUT_WR: ensure this is a simple constant (macro) for the shutdown call and not a macro that expands to code altering the parameter.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP: these are assigned into connection->state and connection->event_loop_info. Verify they are simple constants (enum or object-like macros) and not macros that could expand into assignments or other code affecting the parameter variable.\n\nIn short: inspect each of the above symbols to ensure none are macros or expansions that reassign the local parameter variable 'connection' (or otherwise modify it). The struct definitions are required to confirm the member accesses are ordinary field writes (allowed by MISRA) rather than disguised parameter modifications."
