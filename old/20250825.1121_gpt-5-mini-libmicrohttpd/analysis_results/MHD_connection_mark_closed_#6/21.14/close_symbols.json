  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_connection_mark_closed_ (directly or indirectly) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect all symbols it references and the conditional compilation/path selection that can cause other code to run: \n\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown: Called when TLS is enabled (HTTPS_SUPPORT and MHD_USE_TLS). This function is the prime candidate to contain any memcmp usage; its implementation must be examined for memcmp-based string comparisons.\n- shutdown: The system call invoked when TLS is not used or when MHD_tls_connection_shutdown fails. Included for completeness to verify it does not hide or expand to any string-comparison logic.\n- SHUT_WR: Constant passed to shutdown; included for context of the shutdown call (no memcmp expected, but listed to allow full analysis of the call site).\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: Compile-time macro that controls whether the TLS branch (and thus MHD_tls_connection_shutdown) is present. You must know if that branch is compiled in to know whether to analyze MHD_tls_connection_shutdown.\n- MHD_USE_TLS and MHD_USE_TURBO: Daemon option flags used to select the TLS vs non-TLS path. Their definitions/values are needed to determine which path can be taken at runtime or in static analysis.\n- struct MHD_Daemon (and field: options): The daemon->options field is tested against the above flags; its type/definition may also reveal inline helpers or macros that perform string comparisons (unlikely but needs checking).\n- struct MHD_Connection (and fields: daemon, socket_fd, state, event_loop_info): The function reads/writes these fields; their definitions confirm there are no hidden helper macros or accessor functions that use memcmp.\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP: Enumerators/macros used to set state; included to ensure there are no side-effecting setters or macros that might internally perform string comparisons.\n\nIn short: you must inspect MHD_tls_connection_shutdown (if compiled/selected) and verify none of the referenced macros, constants, or struct accessors expand to or call memcmp on null-terminated strings."
