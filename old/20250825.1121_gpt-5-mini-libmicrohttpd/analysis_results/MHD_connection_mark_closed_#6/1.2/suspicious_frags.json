  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ / __inline, __declspec, typeof, statement-expressions ({:}), named labels as values, or other vendor-specific extensions.\n- The preprocessor constructs (#ifdef/#endif, macros like HTTPS_SUPPORT) are standard C preprocessor features, not compiler extensions.\n- The use of shutdown() and SHUT_WR are OS/POSIX API calls and macros, not compiler language extensions; they should be checked for portability but are not language extensions per the compiler documentation criterion in the rule.\n- The local variable declaration (const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;) and other C syntax used are standard C (C99 and later); nothing in the snippet indicates reliance on an implementation-defined extension explicitly documented as a compiler extension.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need to be flagged under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
