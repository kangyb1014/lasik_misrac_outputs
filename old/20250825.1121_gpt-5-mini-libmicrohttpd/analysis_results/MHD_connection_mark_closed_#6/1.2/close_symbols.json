  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking use of compiler language extensions:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): the target function accesses connection->daemon, connection->socket_fd, connection->state and connection->event_loop_info. The struct definition may itself use language extensions (bit-fields with non-standard widths, packed/ aligned attributes, GCC attributes, anonymous/unnamed fields, typeof, or other extensions). We must inspect the definition to detect any extension use referenced by this function.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (full definition): the function reads daemon->options. The daemon struct or the type of options may use compiler extensions (e.g., attributes, bitfields, typedefs using extensions). The actual type of options is needed to see if macros perform nonstandard operations.\n\n- MHD_USE_TURBO (macro/constant): used in the expression (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TURBO). Macros can expand to expressions using compiler extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, __extension__, inline asm, etc.). We must inspect its definition to ensure it is a plain constant and does not use extensions.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS (macro/constant): same reason as MHD_USE_TURBO \u2014 it appears in a conditional and may be defined via extensions.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (preprocessor macro): controls conditional compilation of a large branch. Its definition (or lack thereof) changes which code is compiled; the macro itself might be defined in build flags or headers using extension constructs. To determine whether any extension appears in the compiled variant, we need to know how HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined or set.\n\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown (declaration and definition): called inside the conditional. The function declaration/definition might use compiler-specific attributes, calling-convention extensions, inline asm, or nonstandard prototypes. Even if the call is to an ordinary C function, its prototype could use extensions that affect MISRA rule compliance.\n\n- shutdown (declaration from system headers): shutdown is a system call wrapper; its declaration may come from platform headers that could use implementation-specific extensions or macros. Also check whether SHUT_WR is a macro that expands to something nonstandard.\n\n- SHUT_WR (macro/constant): used as an argument to shutdown. Like other macros, it may be defined via extensions; verify it is a plain integer constant.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED (macro/enum): assigned to connection->state. The definition may be an enum or macro that uses extensions (e.g., designated initializers, complex macro tricks). Inspect to ensure no language extensions are used.\n\n- MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP (macro/enum): assigned to connection->event_loop_info. Same rationale as MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED.\n\nIn short: inspect the struct/type definitions, all macros/constants used in expressions or assignments, and the declarations/definitions of called functions and system macros. Any of those could hide compiler-specific language extensions; they must be available to determine whether the target function (as compiled) uses such extensions."
