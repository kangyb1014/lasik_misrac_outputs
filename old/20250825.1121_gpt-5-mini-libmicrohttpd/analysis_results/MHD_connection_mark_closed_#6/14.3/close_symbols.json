  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' we must determine whether the if-conditions in MHD_connection_mark_closed_ can be considered invariant at the point of use. Each listed symbol is needed for that analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition, including member 'options' and any const/volatile qualifiers): The primary controlling expressions use daemon->options. To decide if those expressions are invariant you must know the type of options and whether it (or the object it belongs to) is declared const or volatile, and whether it can be modified elsewhere. The struct definition also shows any qualifiers that affect mutability.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition, including member 'daemon', 'socket_fd', 'state', 'event_loop_info'): The local variable daemon is initialized from connection->daemon. You must inspect the connection structure to see whether daemon is a pointer to a mutable or immutable daemon instance and whether that pointer or the pointed-to data can change concurrently. socket_fd/type is needed only to confirm the call semantics (not invariance), and state/event_loop_info members confirm this function\u2019s side-effects but are not primary for the rule.\n\n- MHD_USE_TURBO (preprocessor macro / flag value): The outer controlling expression tests (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TURBO). You must know the macro value (and whether it is a compile-time constant) to interpret the bit-test and to see whether the result could be invariant.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS (preprocessor macro / flag value): If HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined, the inner conditional tests (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS). Its value is required to decide if that bit-test can be invariant.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (preprocessor symbol presence/absence): The TLS-related code is under #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT. If HTTPS_SUPPORT is not defined at compile time, that branch is not present and the invariance analysis changes. You must know whether that code is compiled in.\n\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown (declaration and implementation/semantics): The code contains a run-time call whose return value is tested (if (! MHD_tls_connection_shutdown(connection))). To judge whether that inner controlling expression is invariant you need the function\u2019s behavior (is it a pure constant-returning function, does it depend on runtime state, or could it have side effects). If the function always returns a constant value, that could make the controlling expression invariant; otherwise it is not invariant.\n\n- shutdown (declaration) and SHUT_WR (macro): Although the shutdown call itself is not directly relevant to invariance, SHUT_WR is part of the controlling logic (it appears in the code path guarded by the condition). Knowing SHUT_WR and shutdown prototypes helps confirm that the conditions govern runtime behavior (side effects) rather than being compile-time constants; include them to be thorough.\n\nYou do not need unrelated symbols (response-pool cleanup macros, callers) for deciding whether the controlling expressions here are invariant; the items above provide the information required to determine if the bit-tests or function-call results can be regarded as compile-time or otherwise invariant expressions under MISRA C."
