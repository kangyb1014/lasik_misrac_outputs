  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The controlling expression depends on the run\u2011time value of daemon->options (a field read from the daemon object) masked with the compile\u2011time bit MHD_USE_TURBO; it is not an invariant constant expression. (Note: it would be a violation if the expression were a compile\u2011time or otherwise invariant constant \u2014 for example if daemon->options were a true integer constant or #define/const known at translation time so the test is always true or always false.)"
