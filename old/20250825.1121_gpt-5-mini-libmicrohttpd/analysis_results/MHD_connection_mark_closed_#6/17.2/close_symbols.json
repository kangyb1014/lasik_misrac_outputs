  "explanation": "- MHD_connection_close_: It directly calls MHD_connection_mark_closed_. To prove absence of indirect recursion we must inspect MHD_connection_close_\u2019s body to see if it (or functions it calls) can call back into MHD_connection_mark_closed_.\n- close_connection: It also calls MHD_connection_mark_closed_ and calls MHD_connection_close_. It could create a mutual/indirect recursion cycle, so its implementation must be examined.\n- MHD_destroy_response: Called by MHD_connection_close_. Any call chain from here back to MHD_connection_mark_closed_ would produce indirect recursion, so its body and callees must be checked.\n- MHD_pool_destroy: Called by MHD_connection_close_. Like MHD_destroy_response, it must be checked for any path that eventually calls MHD_connection_mark_closed_."
