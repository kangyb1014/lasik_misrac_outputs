Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA-C for-loop compliance analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): needed to inspect all members referenced in the function (daemon, socket_fd, state, event_loop_info) to ensure no hidden for-loops or side-effecting expressions are present via member access, and to verify no loop counters (if any) are modified via those members.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition): required to locate the options field and to see whether any access can introduce side effects relevant to loop-clauses or to discover inline functions/macros in the structure that might contain for-loops.\n\n- MHD_Connection::daemon (member): the code reads connection->daemon; required to see exact type and any possible side effects or macro indirections when accessing daemon that could contain for-loops or persistent side effects.\n\n- MHD_Connection::socket_fd (member): used as argument to shutdown; include to verify no for-loops or modifications to loop counters occur through socket_fd usage.\n\n- MHD_Connection::state and MHD_Connection::event_loop_info (members): these assignments occur at end of function; their definitions (macros/enums) are needed to confirm they don't expand to expressions with side effects or hidden loops (e.g., via setter macros).\n\n- MHD_Daemon::options (member): used in bitmask tests to select code paths; must confirm its type and that evaluating it has no side effects or macro indirections that could violate clause-2 (no persistent side effects).\n\n- MHD_USE_TURBO and MHD_USE_TLS (macros/constants): required to determine which branches are compiled/executed and whether those branches contain any for-loops or side-effecting expressions (affecting compliance).\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (compile-time macro): controls whether the TLS branch (which calls MHD_tls_connection_shutdown) is present. The presence/absence affects whether any called function bodies must be inspected for for-loops; must know compile configuration.\n\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown (function definition): this is an invoked function (when HTTPS_SUPPORT and MHD_USE_TLS are set). Since \"the behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement,\" its implementation must be inspected for any for loops that might be ill-formed or modify objects used as loop counters in surrounding code.\n\n- shutdown (system call prototype): included to confirm the call is a library/system call without embedded for-loops and to ensure it has no persistent side-effects that would conflict with the MISRA for-clause constraints.\n\n- SHUT_WR (macro): argument to shutdown; include to ensure it is a plain constant macro with no side effects or expansions that could introduce loops or modify objects used elsewhere.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP (macros/enums): these are assigned at function end; include their definitions to verify they are simple constants (no side effects or macro expansions with loops) and that these assignments don't modify any loop counters or objects used in loops.\n\nNotes: The target function itself contains no for-loop, so the primary concern for MISRA I.8.7-like rules is that none of the called functions or any macros expanded here introduce for-loops that violate the rule, and that none of the macros/assignments used have hidden side-effects. The symbols above are the ones needed to decide those points."
