  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for dead-code (MISRA) analysis of MHD_connection_mark_closed_:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the function reads/writes several fields (daemon, socket_fd, state, event_loop_info). Knowledge of the struct layout and any semantic attributes (volatile, write-side effects, or accessors) is required to determine whether assignments or uses are meaningful or redundant.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: the function reads daemon->options to decide control flow; the type and meaning of options (and any invariants) are needed to decide if the conditional is ever true/false (i.e., whether the guarded code is dead).\n\n- MHD_USE_TURBO: this bitmask/flag is used in the outer if condition (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TURBO). Its compile-time value/meaning and how it is used elsewhere determine whether the whole shutdown branch can ever execute.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS: this flag controls the TLS-specific branch when HTTPS_SUPPORT is enabled; its value and use determine reachability of the inner branch that calls MHD_tls_connection_shutdown (impacting whether either branch is dead).\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: a compile-time macro that enables/disables the TLS branch. Whether it is defined changes which code is present; dead-code analysis must know the actual compilation configuration.\n\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown: the function call may have side-effects (shutting TLS, returning success/failure); knowing its semantics and possible return values is required to determine whether the subsequent shutdown() call (or the call itself) is necessary or redundant.\n\n- shutdown: the system/socket call invoked on connection->socket_fd; its side-effects on the socket and whether it is a no-op on certain platforms affect whether that call (or its conditional invocation) is dead.\n\n- SHUT_WR: the shutdown direction argument determines the observable effect of the shutdown() call (write-half close vs full close); its meaning is needed to decide if removal would change program behaviour.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED: the state value assigned to connection->state \u2014 knowing its semantic effect on the rest of the program (used by other code paths) is necessary to decide if this assignment is removable (dead).\n\n- MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP: the value assigned to connection->event_loop_info \u2014 as above, determining whether this write has observable consequence (and thus is not dead) requires knowing its meaning.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine (a) which branches are actually present/possible at compile- and run-time, (b) whether the calls/assignments have observable side-effects, and (c) whether removing any of them would change program behaviour (the MISRA dead-code criterion)."
