  "explanation": "For a correct reachability (MISRA \u2018no unreachable code\u2019) analysis you must know which branches and statements can be eliminated at compile or link time or rendered impossible at run time. Each symbol below is required for that judgment:\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (preprocessor symbol): Controls whether the inner if/else that calls shutdown() is present at compile time. Presence/absence changes the control-flow shape; a compile-time-disabled block could make code that appears in the source unreachable or remove an else branch entirely.\n\n- MHD_USE_TURBO (flag macro): Appears in the outer condition (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TURBO). If this macro has a constant value of 0 or some defined constant that makes the expression constant, the whole outer if may be always true/false and thus can create unreachable regions.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS (flag macro): Appears in the inner condition (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS). If this macro equals 0 or some compile-time constant, the inner if/else behavior is fixed and one branch may be unreachable.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon::options (type and possible const/volatile/compile-time constraints): Knowing the declaration and semantics of options (its type, whether it is a compile-time constant, whether the field can only take certain values) is necessary to decide if the bit-tests above can be resolved to constant true/false and thus create unreachable code.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection::{daemon,socket_fd,state,event_loop_info} (field types and invariants): The connection->daemon nullability/invariants can affect reachability; socket_fd and behaviour of assignments at the end are relevant if any of those writes are unreachable or optimized away by undefined behaviour assumptions.\n\n- MHD_tls_connection_shutdown (function signature and attributes, e.g. return type and attributes like noreturn): If this function is declared noreturn or its return value is statically known, code following the call (or some branches) could be unreachable. Its return-value domain is needed to determine whether the inner conditional body (shutdown call) is reachable.\n\n- shutdown (signature/implementation): Normally a library/system call, but if it is a macro or wrapper that does not return (or always fails/always succeeds) the reachability of subsequent statements could change. Need its exact declaration/behavior.\n\n- SHUT_WR (macro): The presence/value is needed to understand whether the shutdown invocations are distinct or possibly no-ops via macro expansion (affecting semantic reachability reasoning).\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_CLEANUP (constants/macros): These are the l-value assignments at the end; while they do not by themselves create unreachable code, their definitions may reveal side-effect macros or const expressions that affect reachability or optimization assumptions.\n\nProvide these symbols/definitions to the next agent so it can determine whether any branch or statement in MHD_connection_mark_closed_ is provably unreachable (compile-time removed or never-executed at run-time) and thus violates the MISRA rule."
