  "explanation": "The only parts that can plausibly hide unreachable code are the conditional compilation region and the shutdown calls it interacts with; those are listed above for inspection. The outer if (checking MHD_USE_TURBO) and the final assignments to connection->state and connection->event_loop_info are ordinary runtime-conditioned or sequential statements and are not statically unreachable based on the shown code. No return statements, infinite loops, or code after unconditional exits are present elsewhere in the function, and other lines depend on runtime flags or preprocessor inclusion rather than being definitively unreachable, so they do not require investigation for Rule 2.1."
