  "explanation": "The only code that appears to invoke a compiler-specific language extension is the use of the GCC-style attribute(always_inline) via the _MHD_static_inline macro. Other parts of the provided code use standard C constructs: struct/union/enum declarations, size_t/uint8_t types, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef _DEBUG), and ordinary macros (mhd_assert) and function calls. These do not constitute compiler language extensions as defined by compiler documentation, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 1.2. (Note: identifier naming with leading underscore and uppercase is a separate concern but is not a compiler language-extension per Rule 1.2.)"
