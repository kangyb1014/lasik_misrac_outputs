The string literals (MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET/HEAD) themselves are safe, but the code does not check that 'method' is non-NULL and NUL-terminated before calling strcmp.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function answer_unique_empty_response:\n#define MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET \"GET\"\n...\n#define MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD \"HEAD\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The code calls strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET) and strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD) without first ensuring that 'method' is a non-NULL pointer to a NUL-terminated array of char. strcmp (a <string.h> function) will read bytes until a NUL is found, so if 'method' is NULL or does not point to a NUL-terminated buffer this can result in accesses beyond the bounds of the object referenced by 'method' (or a NULL dereference). That is precisely what MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids unless a valid external guarantee exists. The snippet shown contains no such check or proof; therefore the reported violation stands unless the surrounding API/documentation (the caller) formally guarantees that 'method' is always non-NULL and NUL-terminated. A compliant fix is to validate method (e.g. check method != NULL) or otherwise rely on a documented, verifiable precondition."
