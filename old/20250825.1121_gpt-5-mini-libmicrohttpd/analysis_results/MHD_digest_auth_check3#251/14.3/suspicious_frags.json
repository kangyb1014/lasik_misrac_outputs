  "explanation": "No controlling expressions that are compile-time or otherwise invariant were found. The only conditional statements in the provided code are:\n- if (0 == nonce_timeout) \u2014 depends on the runtime parameter nonce_timeout\n- if (0 == max_nc) \u2014 depends on the runtime parameter max_nc\n- if (NULL != buf) \u2014 depends on buf which is assigned by digest_auth_check_all_inner at runtime\nThese are all runtime-dependent and therefore not invariant. The mhd_assert(NULL != password) macro expands to ((void)0) (a no-op) and is not a controlling statement. There are no loops or switch statements with constant conditions in the supplied code. Consequently, there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
