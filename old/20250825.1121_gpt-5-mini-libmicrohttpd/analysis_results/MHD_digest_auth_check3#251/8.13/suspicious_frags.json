  "explanation": "The other pointer occurrences and expressions in the snippet do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: realm, username and password are already const-qualified (const char *), so they conform to the rule; the NULL literal is not a declared pointer type and does not change required qualifiers here; scalar/non-pointer parameters (unsigned int nonce_timeout, uint32_t max_nc, enums) and the enum return type are not subject to pointer const-qualification. The mhd_assert line only checks password against NULL and does not affect pointer qualification. Therefore only the function parameter that declares a non-const pointer to a connection and its propagation into the call site are potential places to check whether the pointer could instead be a pointer-to-const."
