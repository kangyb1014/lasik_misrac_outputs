If digest_auth_check_all also does not modify the connection, the parameter should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection' to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not proven by the snippet. MISRA Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible, but whether a violation exists depends on whether the pointed-to object can/should be modified. In this function the connection pointer is simply forwarded to digest_auth_check_all; we do not know the signature or behaviour of that callee. If digest_auth_check_all takes a non-const struct MHD_Connection * or may modify the connection, then MHD_digest_auth_check3 must also accept a non-const pointer and there is no violation. Conversely, if digest_auth_check_all and all callers treat the connection as immutable, changing the parameter to const struct MHD_Connection * would be appropriate. Given only the provided code there is insufficient evidence to conclude a Rule 8.13 violation. To decide definitively, inspect digest_auth_check_all\u2019s signature and implementation and the intended API contract for struct MHD_Connection; if they do not modify the object, make the pointer const (and update the API consistently)."
