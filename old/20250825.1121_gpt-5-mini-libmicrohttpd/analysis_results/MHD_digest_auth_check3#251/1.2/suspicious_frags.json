  "explanation": "All other code constructs in the provided snippets are standard C and do not represent compiler-specific language extensions. Examples: - The use of standard fixed-width integer type uint32_t (from C99 stdint.h) and enum types are standard C features. - The mhd_assert macro expands to ((void)0), which is a standard macro idiom. - Pointer and const usage, the function body (calls to digest_auth_check_all, return statement), and NULL usage are standard C. Therefore they do not need further investigation for Rule 1.2."
