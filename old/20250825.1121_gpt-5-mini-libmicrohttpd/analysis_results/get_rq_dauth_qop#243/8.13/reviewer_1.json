According to MISRA C 2023 R8.13, pointers used only for reading should point to const-qualified types. Here value.str should be declared as const char * (or the API should provide a const-qualified pointer) because the function only reads the characters; therefore the current usage violates R8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function get_rq_dauth_qop:\n#define MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_s_bin_n(q, l, u) MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_bin_n(q,l,u,MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(u))\n...\n#define MHD_str_equal_caseless_s_bin_n_(a, s, l) ((MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(a)==(l))&&MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_(a,s,l))\n...\n#define MHD_TOKEN_AUTH_ \"auth\"\n...\n#define MHD_TOKEN_AUTH_INT_ \"auth-int\"\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Conclusion: The report is plausible but cannot be confirmed from the code shown. Reasoning: MISRA C:2023 R8.13 expects pointers that are used only for reading to point to const-qualified types. In get_rq_dauth_qop the code only reads the characters via qop_param->value.str, so if value.str is declared as char * (non-const) then this usage would be a violation of R8.13 (because the pointer should be declared const char *). Note that declaring qop_param as const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *const does NOT make the pointee of the member pointer const \u2014 the member has type char * const in that case, not const char *; so the issue described by agent A is technically valid if the struct member is non-const. However, the struct definition of value.str was not provided in the materials, so we cannot definitively say the code as compiled violates R8.13. If value.str is already declared as const char * (or the API requires a non-const pointer for legitimate reasons), then there is no violation. Recommended fixes (if value.str is non-const and only read): change the member's type to const char * (preferred), or otherwise justify a documented deviation or change call sites appropriately."
