  "explanation": "To decide whether get_rq_dauth_qop can cause out-of-bounds accesses you must know exactly how the comparison functions and the data they compare behave: \n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_s_bin_n (prototype + implementation): the target calls this when qop_param->quoted is true. You must inspect its code to see how it reads qop_param->value.str and how it uses qop_param->value.len (does it skip surrounding quotes, add or subtract length, rely on a terminating NUL, call memcmp/strlen, etc.). Only the implementation reveals whether it can read beyond the provided length.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_s_bin_n_ (prototype + implementation): same reasoning for the non-quoted path \u2014 its behavior (how many bytes it reads, whether it assumes NUL termination, whether it reads exactly value.len bytes) is essential to determine bounds safety.\n\n- Any helper/string comparison routines called by the above (prototypes + implementations): the two comparison functions may delegate to small wrappers or use standard C library calls (memcmp, strncasecmp, strlen, etc.). You must examine those callees to track any memory read sizes and confirm they do not read past the buffers described by value.str/value.len.\n\n- MHD_TOKEN_AUTH_ and MHD_TOKEN_AUTH_INT_ (definitions): these are the literal token buffers being compared against qop_param->value. Their contents and lengths (including whether they include quotes or trailing NULs) are needed to know how many bytes the comparison code will attempt to read from each side and whether comparisons can index beyond qop_param->value.len.\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuthParam (full definition), and specifically the nested value member (types/semantics of value.str and value.len): you must know the exact types (pointer type, integer type for len) and the meaning of value.len (is it the number of bytes available, does it include a terminating NUL, does it include quotes when quoted==true?). Also confirm whether value.str can be non-NULL with a smaller value.len and whether other invariants hold. Without this, you cannot determine if the comparison functions can legally read the bytes they access.\n\nTogether, these symbols let you trace how many bytes are accessed on each side of each comparison and whether any use of string.h routines inside those helpers can read past the buffers specified by value.str/value.len. Only with their implementations and the data layout semantics can you verify compliance with the MISRA rule about not accessing beyond object bounds."
