  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant. Each conditional depends on runtime data or function results:\n\n- if (NULL == qop_param->value.str): tests a runtime pointer value (depends on the argument passed).\n- if (qop_param->quoted): tests a runtime boolean/member of the passed structure.\n- The calls to MHD_str_equal_caseless_quoted_s_bin_n(...) and MHD_str_equal_caseless_s_bin_n_(...): these are function (or macro) calls whose results depend on the runtime contents/length of qop_param->value and thus are not compile-time invariants (even though token macros like MHD_TOKEN_AUTH_ may be compile-time constants, the comparison result depends on the runtime string and length).\n\nThere are no loops (for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions, and no if conditions are compile-time constant expressions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
