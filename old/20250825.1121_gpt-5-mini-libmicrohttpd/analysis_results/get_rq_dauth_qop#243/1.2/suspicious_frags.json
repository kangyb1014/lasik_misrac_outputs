  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions were detected in the provided code. I checked for common, explicitly-documented compiler extensions such as: __attribute__ or __attribute__((...)), __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, inline assembly (asm/__asm__), GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, anonymous structs/unions used as extensions, token-pasting tricks beyond standard macros, or other vendor-specific keywords. The backslashes seen at line ends are simple source line splices (preprocessor line splicing), which is standard C and not a compiler extension. Use of enum, static, const, pointer-to-const, bool (from stdbool.h), string macros, and function calls are all standard C features. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
