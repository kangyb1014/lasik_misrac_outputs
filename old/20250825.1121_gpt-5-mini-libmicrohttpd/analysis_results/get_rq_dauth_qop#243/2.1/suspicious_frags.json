  "explanation": "I did not find any code in the provided function that is definitely unreachable (i.e. cannot be executed under any feasible runtime or compile-time condition). Rationale:\n\n- The function contains conditional returns only; none of the statements are located after an unconditional return in the same execution path. Each return is guarded by a condition, so those later statements remain reachable in other execution paths.\n- Both the quoted and unquoted branches are reachable depending on the runtime value of qop_param->quoted, and the final return (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_QOP_INVALID) is reachable when none of the earlier comparisons match. There are no dead labels, unreachable statements after a guaranteed-return, nor impossible constant boolean expressions visible in this snippet.\n- There is no evidence here of compile-time constructs (e.g. #if 0) or definitions that would make any part of this snippet permanently omitted or skipped; any macros called (MHD_str_equal_* etc.) could affect behavior, but their use does not by itself make the code shown unreachable.\n\nNotes for investigators (not flagged as suspicious fragments here):\n- To fully rule out unreachable code in the project, ensure this static function is actually referenced somewhere in the translation unit; an unreferenced static function would be unreachable from the program and should be investigated. (This is a project-level linkage/usage check outside this snippet.)\n- Also check macro/function definitions used in the comparisons to ensure none expand to constructs that would make branches impossible at compile time."
