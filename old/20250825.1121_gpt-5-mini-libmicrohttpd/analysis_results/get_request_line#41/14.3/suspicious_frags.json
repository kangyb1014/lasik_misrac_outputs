  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in this function are invariant and therefore none require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Reasoning for each conditional construct:\n\n1) if (! get_request_line_inner(c)) \u2014 depends on the return value of a function call at runtime, not constant.\n2) if ((NULL != c->rq.version) && (HTTP_VER_LEN < (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.proc_pos - (size_t)(c->rq.version - c->read_buffer)))) \u2014 depends on runtime fields of the connection structure; not invariant.\n3) if (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING < c->state) \u2014 depends on the runtime value of c->state; not invariant.\n4) if (0 != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri) \u2014 depends on a runtime counter; not invariant.\n5) if (! wsp_in_uri) and if (! wsp_in_uri_keep) \u2014 wsp_in_uri and wsp_in_uri_keep are derived from discp_lvl, which is read from c->daemon->client_discipline at runtime; they are not compile-time constants and can vary between calls, so these conditions are not invariant.\n6) if (! process_request_target(c)) \u2014 depends on the runtime result of a function call; not invariant.\n\nAdditional notes: mhd_assert() calls are assertions/macros and are not selection/iteration controlling statements subject to Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions in this function. Therefore no code fragments in this function appear to violate Rule 14.3."
