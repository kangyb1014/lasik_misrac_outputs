  "explanation": "To decide whether any branch or operation in get_request_line is dead code we must know all symbols that affect control flow, side-effects, or the truth-values of conditions in the function. For each listed symbol:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The entire function reads and writes fields of this type. Its definition (and nested structs) is required to know which fields exist, their types and whether reads/writes have side effects or aliasing that could make code necessary.\n\n- MHD_Daemon::client_discipline: get_request_line computes wsp_in_uri and wsp_in_uri_keep from this value. To determine whether either branch that depends on these booleans can ever be taken (or is always the same), the domain/semantics of client_discipline and where it is set must be known.\n\n- get_request_line_inner: The initial if depends directly on its return value and the function may also set c->rq.version, c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.proc_pos and possibly c->state. We must know all possible return values and its side-effects to know if the 'not found yet' path can occur and whether later code is reachable.\n\n- process_request_target: Its boolean return controls the path toward setting c->state and therefore whether the final part of the function is ever executed. Its side-effects (modifying c fields/state) are also relevant.\n\n- send_redirect_fixed_rq_target: Called when whitespace in URI should trigger a redirect; we must know whether it can always/never be called or if it has side effects that influence reachability of subsequent code (for example, if it always aborts/changes state).\n\n- transmit_error_response_static and transmit_error_response_len: Called on several error paths. Their semantics (do they always terminate/close the connection or set particular state fields?) determine whether code following their calls is effectively dead or needed for program behaviour. Both names are included because the static graph shows a length-suffixed variant while the code uses a _static name; the actual implementation chosen affects analysis.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING and connection state enum / all state constants: The comparison MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING < c->state decides an immediate return; to reason if that condition can ever be true (or is always true/false) we need the full set of connection state values and transitions that can occur before/inside this function.\n\n- HTTP_VER_LEN: Used in the bounds check that may trigger an error path. Its numeric value and the semantics of HTTP version parsing are needed to see whether that error branch is achievable.\n\n- c->read_buffer, c->rq.version, c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.proc_pos: The pointer/offset arithmetic (proc_pos - (size_t)(c->rq.version - c->read_buffer)) and the bound check require knowing how these fields are set and their valid ranges to determine if that condition is ever true.\n\n- c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt, c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri: Presence and content of the request target and counted whitespace decide whether whitespace-handling branches (error, redirect, keep) are reachable.\n\n- c->rq.url, c->rq.url_len: Asserted zero/null at a point in the function; to know whether those asserts can ever be violated (making code reliant on them dead) we need to know how/when those fields are set elsewhere.\n\n- c->rq.http_ver and MHD_HTTP_VER_INVALID: The code assigns the invalid marker in an error path. To judge whether that assignment is reachable and whether its removal would change behaviour we must know the semantics of http_ver and uses of the MHD_HTTP_VER_INVALID value elsewhere.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, REQUEST_MALFORMED, RQ_TARGET_INVALID_CHAR: These constants are passed to transmit_error_response_*; if they are macros with side effects or mapped to different handlers these could affect whether the error-call sites are necessary. At minimum they document the error paths invoked.\n\n- mhd_assert macro / definition: The code contains several mhd_assert calls. If mhd_assert contains side effects (or is omitted in production builds) that changes whether the asserted operations contribute to runtime behaviour; therefore its definition is needed to decide if those statements are dead.\n\nIn summary: to determine dead code under MISRA's rule you must be able to prove that removing an operation does not affect program behaviour. That requires the types and definitions above (state constants, the precise behaviour/return values and side effects of the called helper functions, and the concrete layout/semantics of the connection/request fields) so you can reason about which branches can actually occur at runtime and which statements never influence observable behaviour."
