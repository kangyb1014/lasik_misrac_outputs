  "explanation": "I found no code fragment in get_request_line that modifies the function parameter variable c itself. The function only reads c and writes to members of the object pointed to by c (for example c->rq.http_ver = ... and c->state = ...), which is explicitly permitted by the rule. There are no assignments to c (no statements like c = ..., ++c, or similar), no taking of &c to pass a pointer-to-parameter, and no other operations that would change the pointer variable. Calls that pass c to other functions do not constitute modification of this function's parameter. Therefore there are no fragments here that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
