  "explanation": "1) MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (prototype)\n   - Why required: try_match_header passes 'prefix' and 'line' into this function. To decide whether try_match_header can/should declare its 'line' parameter as a const char * (or whether the parameter types must remain non-const), you must know the exact parameter types MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ expects (in particular the type/const-qualification of the second argument). If MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ takes a non-const char * and may modify the buffer, 'line' cannot be made const; if it takes a const char * (the usual case), passing a const char * is safe.\n\n2) strdup (prototype)\n   - Why required: try_match_header calls strdup(&line[prefix_len]) and assigns the result into *suffix. The signature of strdup (char *strdup(const char *)) is needed to determine whether it accepts a const char * argument (so &line[prefix_len] can be const) and to know the const-qualification of the returned pointer (it returns a modifiable char*). This affects whether the function should accept/return const-qualified types for suffix and whether assigning the strdup result to *suffix violates the rule.\n\n3) process_multipart_headers (prototype / source)\n   - Why required: process_multipart_headers is the caller of try_match_header (per the call graph). To judge whether try_match_header's parameter types can be changed to add const (for example changing char *line to const char *line, or changing char **suffix to const char ** or char * const *), you must see how the caller declares and uses the variables it passes (does the caller expect to modify the pointed-to characters, does it expect to receive a writable char* via suffix, etc.). The caller's prototype or source shows the types and usage semantics of 'line' and 'suffix' at call sites, which is necessary to decide whether adding const qualifiers would be compatible.\n\nNote: obtaining the exact prototypes (including const qualifiers) is sufficient; deeper internals of lower-level helpers (e.g., charsequalcaseless) are only needed if the intermediate wrapper (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_) does not expose constness clearly. If MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ is not available, its callee (charsequalcaseless) prototype would also be required."
