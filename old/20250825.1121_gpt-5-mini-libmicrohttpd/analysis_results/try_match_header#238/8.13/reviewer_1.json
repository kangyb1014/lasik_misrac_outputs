In this code 'line' should be declared 'const char *line' and the call become strdup(&line[prefix_len]).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In try_match_header the parameter 'line' is never modified (only read and indexed), so per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (i.e. const char *line). The call to strdup(&line[prefix_len]) is compatible with const char * (strdup takes a const char *), so changing the parameter to const char * is the appropriate fix. The only caveat is if this function must match an externally required API that requires a non-const char *; in that case the deviation should be documented. Given the provided code alone, the report of a violation is correct."
