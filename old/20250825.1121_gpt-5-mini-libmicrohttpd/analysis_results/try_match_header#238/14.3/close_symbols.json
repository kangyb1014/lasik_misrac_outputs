  "explanation": "You need the following symbols to determine whether any controlling expression in try_match_header is invariant:\n\n- process_multipart_headers: This function is the caller of try_match_header. To decide whether the test \"if (NULL != *suffix)\" is invariant you must see how the caller initializes and passes the suffix pointer (and the buffer pointed to by line). The caller may set or reuse the suffix variable (or pass a constant/NULL), making the condition invariant or not.\n\n- try_get_value: process_multipart_headers also calls try_get_value and may use it to set the same suffix or related state before calling try_match_header. Inspecting try_get_value is needed to know whether *suffix can be pre-initialized (making the NULL check invariant) or modified in ways that affect the controlling expression.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: The if-condition inside the loop calls this function. To determine if that controlling expression can be invariant you must examine its implementation/semantics (return value behavior, whether it can always return a constant irrespective of its inputs). If it were a wrapper that always returns the same value, the condition could be invariant.\n\n- charsequalcaseless: MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ calls this symbol. The concrete comparison logic and any special-case behavior that could make MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ return a constant (or depend only on global state) will live here; include it in the analysis.\n\n- strdup: The function sets *suffix = strdup(...). While strdup itself does not affect the controlling expressions directly, you must confirm that the assignment happens only when the initial check passes and that strdup has no hidden side effects that alter global state used by any controlling expression. It is also useful to verify that strdup semantics do not influence invariance reasoning about the suffix pointer across calls.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: These macros/enum values are used as return values. Understanding their definitions and whether they map to ordinary constants (and whether those constants are used in any controlling expressions elsewhere) helps rule out any macro magic that could affect analysis of invariant conditions.\n\nIn short: to judge MISRA Rule (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) you must examine the caller(s) that provide the inputs tested by try_match_header (process_multipart_headers and try_get_value) and the implementation of the comparison helper (MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ and its callee charsequalcaseless). Additionally, confirm the behavior of strdup and the MHD_YES/MHD_NO definitions to rule out hidden invariants or side effects."
