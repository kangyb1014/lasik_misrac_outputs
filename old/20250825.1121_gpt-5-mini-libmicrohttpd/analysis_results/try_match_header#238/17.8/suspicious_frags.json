  "explanation": "The remaining parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 17.8: prefix is declared const and is not assigned anywhere; prefix_len (a non-pointer parameter) is not modified; the calls to MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ and the underlying charsequalcaseless use const parameters and only read characters; no other assignments to the function parameters occur. Therefore only the shown fragments (the function parameter declarations and the loop/lines that perform pointer arithmetic/assignments) require further review."
