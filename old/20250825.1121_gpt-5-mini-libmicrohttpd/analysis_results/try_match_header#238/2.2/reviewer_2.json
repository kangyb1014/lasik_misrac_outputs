  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids code that can be removed from the project without affecting program behaviour. The call to try_match_header is not globally removable: when the suffix pointer (*suffix) is NULL the function performs a meaningful action (it may strdup() and set *suffix). Although in a particular execution where pp->content_transfer_encoding is already non-NULL the call immediately returns and has no effect, that execution-specific no-op does not make the call dead code in the project. Dead code must be code that can be removed without affecting program behaviour in any reachable execution (unreachable code is different). Therefore the presence of a fast-return path for certain inputs does not constitute a violation of Rule 2.2 here."
