  "explanation": "Fragments not listed as suspicious were reviewed and considered not to be candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2 for the following reasons:\n\n- The buffer parsing and control-flow checks in process_multipart_headers (calculating newline, checking newline == buffer_pos/buffer_size, setting pp->state, pp->skip_rn, terminating the header string with buf[newline] = '\\0', the early returns) are control-flow and error-handling operations with observable effects; removing them would change program behaviour, so they are not dead code.\n\n- The try_get_value calls (for Content-disposition) are side-effecting operations that populate pp->content_name and pp->content_filename; they cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n\n- The comparisons using MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ for \"Content-disposition: \" are used to direct parsing flow; these comparisons are part of decision logic and are not dead.\n\n- Simple returns and variable initializations that propagate state (e.g. setting pp->skip_rn, pp->state, incrementing (*ioffptr)) are necessary to maintain parsing state and data flow; they are not dead code.\n\nThe fragments chosen as suspicious above were selected because they contain operations that may be redundant, never produce an observable effect, or include branches/assignments whose necessity is unclear and therefore warrant investigation for potential dead code: the early-exit check on *suffix, the repeated prefix-search loop and its matching logic, the dynamic allocation assignment via strdup without error handling, and the string-comparison helper implementations (their return logic contains branches that might never be exercised given how they are called). These merit closer scrutiny to determine whether any executed operations are in fact dead code."
