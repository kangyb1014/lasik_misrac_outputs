  "explanation": "- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: The target calls this function to compare prefix and the current position in line for prefix_len bytes. To check for out\u2011of\u2011bounds string accesses you must inspect its implementation/contract (does it read exactly prefix_len bytes? does it check NUL termination? does it use standard <string.h> functions such as memcmp/strncmp internally?). Its behavior determines whether the call can read past the ends of prefix or line.\n\n- charsequalcaseless: This is a callee of MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (shown in the static call graph). Its implementation may perform the actual character comparisons and may call standard string routines or perform indexing that could read beyond buffer bounds. You need this symbol to fully understand whether the comparison is safe.\n\n- strdup: The target uses strdup(&line[prefix_len]) when a match is found. strdup copies bytes until a NUL; to verify no out\u2011of\u2011bounds read occurs you must confirm that &line[prefix_len] points to a NUL\u2011terminated region and understand how strdup performs the copy (it typically uses strcpy/strlen internally). Inspecting strdup (or the platform's strdup behavior) is necessary to determine compliance with the MISRA string\u2011bounds rule.\n\n- process_multipart_headers: This is the caller of try_match_header (and the likely provider/allocator of the line buffer). To determine whether indexing &line[prefix_len] or the comparisons in MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ can run past the allocated/initialized bounds of the line buffer you must inspect how line is created, its guaranteed length and NUL termination in the caller.\n\n(Other symbols such as MHD_YES/MHD_NO and NULL are not required to assess string\u2011bounds safety.)"
