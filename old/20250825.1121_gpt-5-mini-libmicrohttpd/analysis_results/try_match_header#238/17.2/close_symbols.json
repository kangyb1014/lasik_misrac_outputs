  "explanation": "To determine whether try_match_header participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine the transitive call graph reachable from and reaching back to it. Each listed symbol is required because:\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: Called directly by try_match_header; you must inspect its body to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls try_match_header or any function that does.\n- charsequalcaseless: Callee of MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_; inspect it for any calls that could lead back into the try_match_header call chain.\n- process_multipart_headers: Known caller of try_match_header (it calls try_match_header); inspect it to see if it is reachable from try_match_header (i.e., whether try_match_header -> ... -> process_multipart_headers exists), which would form an indirect recursion.\n- try_get_value: Callee of process_multipart_headers; included because it could contain calls that close a cycle back to try_match_header.\n- post_process_multipart: Caller of process_multipart_headers and listed caller of MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_; include to check possible paths from try_match_header back into process_multipart_headers/try_match_header.\n- MHD_post_process: Listed caller of MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_; include to check for alternative call paths that could participate in a cycle.\n- MHD_create_post_processor: Listed caller of MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_; include for the same reason as MHD_post_process.\n\nInspecting these function bodies (and any further callees they contain) is sufficient to determine whether any path exists that leads from try_match_header back to itself (indirect recursion)."
