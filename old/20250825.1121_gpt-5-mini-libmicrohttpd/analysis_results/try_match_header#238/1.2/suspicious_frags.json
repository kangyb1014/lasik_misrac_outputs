  "explanation": "All other code constructs in the provided fragments use standard C syntax and standard types (e.g. static, int, const, size_t, pointers, loops, returns, ternary operator). There are no explicit compiler-specific keywords or built-ins visible (such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm__, typeof, __declspec, __inline__ with compiler-specific spelling, or other documented compiler extensions). The identifiers and expressions not listed above therefore do not by themselves indicate use of language extensions. The items reported are suspicious because: 1) _MHD_static_inline is a macro whose definition may map to a compiler-specific inline/attribute construct and thus could be a language/implementation extension; 2) strdup is not part of ISO C (it is commonly a POSIX/implementation extension) and may indicate use of nonstandard library functions; 3) isasciiupper (and by similarity any isascii* family) is not part of ISO C and may be an implementation-specific function or macro. Those reported fragments should be investigated further (expand the macro definitions and check library availability/documentation) to determine whether they rely on language/compiler extensions. No other fragments in the provided code appear to use compiler language extensions."
