  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule against compiler language extensions you must inspect any called routines, macros and typedefs that could hide use of extensions. Each listed symbol is needed for the following reason:\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: this function is directly called by try_match_header; its definition may be a macro or use compiler extensions (inline asm, statement-expressions, GCC attributes, typeof, builtins, etc.). You must inspect its code/definition to ensure no language extensions are used.\n\n- charsequalcaseless: the static call graph shows MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ calls this symbol. It may be implemented using compiler extensions (macros, intrinsics, gcc-specific ops). Its body/definition must be checked.\n\n- strdup: used to allocate and duplicate the suffix string. strdup is POSIX (not strictly standard C); it might be provided as a macro or inline wrapper that uses compiler-specific extensions. You need its declaration/definition to determine whether its usage relies on language extensions or nonstandard declarations.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: these return values/macros/constants are used in try_match_header. Their definitions could be macros or enum constants defined with compiler-specific extensions or attributes; inspect to ensure they are standard C constructs.\n\n- NULL: the code compares with NULL; although usually a standard macro, some projects redefine NULL or use compiler-specific constructs for it. Confirm its definition to ensure no extension is used.\n\n- size_t: the parameter type; its typedef location (stddef.h or custom typedef) must be checked to ensure it is a standard typedef and not an extension or compiler-specific type alias.\n\nOnly after examining these symbols' declarations/definitions can you determine whether try_match_header (through its calls and macros) relies on compiler language extensions that MISRA forbids."
