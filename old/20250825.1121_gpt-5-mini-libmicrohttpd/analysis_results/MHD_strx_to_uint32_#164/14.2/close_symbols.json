Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "toxdigitvalue: This is the only function called from MHD_strx_to_uint32_. MISRA's for\u2011loop rule treats the behaviour of a for loop body as including the behaviour of any functions called within that statement; therefore, to determine whether any for loops that affect the target function's compliance exist in called code, the implementation of toxdigitvalue must be inspected (to see if it contains any for loops and whether those for loops are well\u2011formed). Note: MHD_strx_to_uint32_ itself contains no for statements (it uses a while), so strictly speaking there is no for\u2011loop in this function to check; however, to be exhaustive about any for\u2011loop related violations reachable from this function, the called function toxdigitvalue must be examined."
