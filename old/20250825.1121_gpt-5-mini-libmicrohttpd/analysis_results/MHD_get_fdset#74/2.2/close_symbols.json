  "explanation": "Reason each symbol is required to assess dead-code (MISRA) for MHD_get_fdset:\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2: MHD_get_fdset is essentially a thin wrapper that immediately calls MHD_get_fdset2 with a computed size argument. To determine whether MHD_get_fdset has unique behaviour (i.e. side-effects) or is redundant, you must inspect MHD_get_fdset2 implementation (and whether different size values produce different behaviour). If MHD_get_fdset merely forwards and is never called, it may be dead.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (fields: fdset_size_set_by_app, fdset_size): The wrapper selects the last argument based on these fields when HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is defined. To know whether either branch of the ternary (or whole branch) is effectively dead you must know the semantics and possible values of these fields (are they ever set/cleared, are they constant?).\n\n- writers of MHD_Daemon::fdset_size_set_by_app and MHD_Daemon::fdset_size: Identifying all assignment sites that modify these fields is necessary to determine whether the runtime branch in MHD_get_fdset can ever choose one alternative or the other. If the flag is never written (or always written to the same value), one branch may be dead.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE (preprocessor macro): This macro decides at compile time whether the code includes the ternary that depends on daemon fields or always uses the default. If the macro is not defined the alternate branch is compile-time dead; you must know the build configuration/definition to decide.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE (macro/constant): The default value participates in the selection. If the daemon->fdset_size is always equal to this default (or the macro forces a single value), removal of one branch might not change behaviour.\n\n- _MHD_EXTERN (macro/visibility/export specifier): Determines linkage/visibility of MHD_get_fdset. If the symbol has external linkage (exported API), it may be used by external translation units/binaries not visible in the current translation-unit call graph; that affects whether it is dead code within the whole project.\n\n- project-wide references (callers) / export table entries for MHD_get_fdset (all compilation units and external linkage information): The static call graph provided shows no callers, but to conclude dead code you must examine the whole-project call graph and linker/export tables to see if MHD_get_fdset is ever referenced (including from other modules or external consumers). If it has no callers and is not exported, it is dead.\n\n- public header declarations that expose MHD_get_fdset (API headers): Presence in a public header indicates intended external use; even if no internal callers exist, the function might be part of the public API and thus not dead for the project as a whole.\n\n- MHD_socket typedef/definition: While not likely to affect dead-code status directly, the typedef/ABI may affect linkage/signature and whether callers (internal or external) can/are calling the function; include it to resolve references and linkage when scanning the codebase.\n\nOptional but possibly useful (not strictly required if you obtain MHD_get_fdset2 definition and full project symbol references): the implementations/callees used by MHD_get_fdset2 (e.g. MHD_DLOG, MHD_add_to_fd_set_, internal_get_fdset2) if you need to reason whether side-effects exist in the callee that would make removal of the wrapper change behaviour."
