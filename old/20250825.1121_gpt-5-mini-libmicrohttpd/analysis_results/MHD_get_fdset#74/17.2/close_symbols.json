  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_fdset participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine the functions it calls and their transitive callees:\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2: directly called by the target. You must inspect its body and its callees to see if any path returns (directly or indirectly) to MHD_get_fdset or to MHD_get_fdset2 itself (which would be indirect recursion).\n- internal_get_fdset2: called by MHD_get_fdset2 (per the provided call graph). It could contain calls back to MHD_get_fdset or to other functions that form a cycle, so its definition/callees are required.\n- MHD_DLOG: called by MHD_get_fdset2. Although likely a logging helper, it could call other functions; its body/callees must be checked for any call chain that leads back to MHD_get_fdset or MHD_get_fdset2.\n- MHD_add_to_fd_set_: called by MHD_get_fdset2. Like the others, its implementation/callees must be inspected for any call path that would form a cycle.\n\nIn short, you need the full definitions (or at least the call lists) for MHD_get_fdset2 and each function it calls (and recursively their callees) to prove absence of direct or indirect self-calls involving MHD_get_fdset."
