  "explanation": "All other code in this function is a straightforward return of a single call to MHD_get_fdset2 and contains no statements following the return (no post-return unreachable statements). The only source of potentially unreachable code here is the preprocessor conditional that selects one of two different expressions at compile time: depending on whether HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is defined, one branch will be omitted from the translation unit and thus effectively unreachable in that build. Therefore only the entire #ifdef...#endif block (and the two alternative expressions it contains) need investigation for Rule 2.1. No other fragments in the provided function introduce unreachable code."
