  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function (and the project it touches) contains unreachable code you must know which compile-time branch is actually compiled and whether any runtime expressions are compile-time constants or otherwise force branches to be dead. Specifically:\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE: The #ifdef controls which source branch is compiled. Whether this macro is defined determines whether the daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app conditional exists at all; that directly affects reachability inside this function.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (fdset_size_set_by_app, fdset_size): You must inspect the daemon type to see whether fdset_size_set_by_app is a true runtime-modifiable field, a compile-time constant, a macro, or otherwise guaranteed to have a fixed value. If it cannot vary, one arm of the ternary would be unreachable.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE: The constant used in the argument may interact with conditional compilation or optimization; knowing its definition helps identify constant-folding that could render branches in callees unreachable.\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2 (definition): The target function simply forwards to this function. Unreachable code might not appear in MHD_get_fdset itself but could appear inside MHD_get_fdset2 (or be made unreachable there because the fdset-size argument is a compile-time constant). You need the full implementation to detect any dead branches introduced by the forwarded argument.\n\n- MHD_DLOG, MHD_add_to_fd_set_, internal_get_fdset2 (definitions): These are callees (directly or indirectly) of MHD_get_fdset2 per the static call graph. To conclude the project contains unreachable code you must examine these bodies for code paths that can never be taken given the actual inputs/compile-time constants propagated from MHD_get_fdset.\n\n- MHD_socket and fd_set typedefs/headers: Include these if they are macros or aliases that could affect compile-time evaluation or conditional compilation; they are part of the calling convention/argument types and may influence inlining/optimizations that change reachability.\n\nCollecting these symbols (macro definitions and the full bodies of the called functions and the daemon structure) is sufficient to determine whether any branch or whole statement in the target function or the functions it immediately invokes is provably unreachable (MISRA rule on unreachable code)."
