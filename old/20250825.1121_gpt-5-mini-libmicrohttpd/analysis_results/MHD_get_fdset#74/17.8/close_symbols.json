  "explanation": "Why each is needed to check the MISRA rule (a function parameter shall not be modified):\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2: The call in MHD_get_fdset might be a function or a macro. If it is a macro, its expansion could contain assignments to the parameter identifiers (e.g. daemon, read_fd_set) at the call site, which would violate the MISRA rule for MHD_get_fdset. If it is a function, its body cannot make assignments to the caller's parameter variables, but we still need the declaration to confirm it is not a macro and to inspect any inline/inlineable expansion. Therefore the exact declaration/definition (or macro) is required.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE: This preprocessor symbol controls which argument expression is compiled into the call. Whether the conditional expression is present can change whether daemon is dereferenced in the call site (and whether any side-effecting expressions are evaluated). We need to know if the symbol is defined to know the actual compiled code to inspect for parameter modification.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition; fields: fdset_size_set_by_app, fdset_size): The conditional argument reads fields from the daemon pointer. We must inspect the definitions of these fields (and any accessor macros) to ensure that their evaluation does not perform hidden assignments to the parameter variable (for example via accessor macros or overloaded macros that expand into code with assignments). Having the struct and any associated macros lets us verify that only reads occur.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE: This macro supplies the fallback expression; if it expands to an expression with side effects (unlikely but possible), it could modify parameters at the call site. We need its definition to be sure the compiled argument expression is side\u2011effect free with respect to the parameters.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef/definition): Confirming the type of max_fd (and that the cast/usage in the call is correct) is necessary to ensure no hidden macro/overloaded cast expands into code that assigns to the max_fd parameter variable. It also documents whether max_fd is a pointer type (so only the pointed-to object may be modified, which is allowed) or something else that could affect the MISRA analysis."
