  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_fdset (via MHD_get_fdset2) violates the MISRA rule forbidding memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect the implementation where memcmp could be used and the data passed to it. Specifically:\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2: Primary callee of MHD_get_fdset; its implementation must be inspected for any use of memcmp (direct or indirect) and the arguments passed to memcmp.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: Called by MHD_get_fdset2. Logging functions sometimes format/compare strings or call utility functions that may use memcmp; inspect its body for memcmp or string comparisons implemented with memcmp.\n\n- MHD_add_to_fd_set_: Called by MHD_get_fdset2. Inspect for memcmp use or for passing string/buffer pointers to lower-level routines that use memcmp.\n\n- internal_get_fdset2: Called by MHD_get_fdset2. Must be checked for memcmp usage or further propagation of string buffers to memcmp.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: Definition is needed to know types/contents of members (e.g. any char* fields) that might be passed into functions that perform comparisons; also to understand conditional branches (fdset_size_set_by_app, fdset_size) in the wrapper that could affect which code path (and which functions) are taken.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE and _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE: These compile\u2011time controls affect which arguments/paths are used when calling MHD_get_fdset2. Knowing their definitions helps determine the exact call sequence and whether alternative code paths (which might contain memcmp) are compiled in.\n\n- Transitive callees of MHD_get_fdset2 (any functions called by MHD_DLOG, MHD_add_to_fd_set_, internal_get_fdset2): memcmp could be buried deeper; to be certain there is no forbidden memcmp usage comparing null\u2011terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect all downstream functions reachable from MHD_get_fdset2.\n\nIn short, inspect MHD_get_fdset2 and its entire transitive call tree plus the daemon type and relevant macros to find any memcmp uses and verify whether those uses compare null\u2011terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
