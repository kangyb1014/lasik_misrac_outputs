  "explanation": "For MISRA C pointer-const analysis you must know whether any of the pointer parameters in MHD_get_fdset (daemon, read_fd_set, write_fd_set, except_fd_set, max_fd) are modified by this function or by callees it forwards to. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2: its prototype/definition is essential to see the parameter types/const-qualification and whether it writes through the fd_set/MHD_socket/daemon pointers. If MHD_get_fdset2 mutates those objects, MHD_get_fdset cannot safely declare them const.\n\n- internal_get_fdset2: MHD_get_fdset2 calls this; its signature/implementation reveals whether fd_set pointers are modified deeper in the call chain and thus whether const would be inappropriate.\n\n- MHD_add_to_fd_set_: similarly, this helper likely manipulates fd_set contents; its prototype/implementation shows whether it writes via fd_set* parameters.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: included because logging functions sometimes take pointers; need its prototype to confirm it does not require non-const pointers (mostly for completeness to ensure no implicit non-const use).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: definition is required to know types of fdset_size_set_by_app and fdset_size and whether daemon is only read or also modified by downstream calls; this affects whether daemon* could be const.\n\n- fd_set (typedef/struct): the actual type definition is needed to determine whether the API semantics require mutation and whether the pointer could be const-qualified.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef): the type of max_fd must be known to decide if max_fd pointer might be const-qualified.\n\n- enum MHD_Result: return type definition (for completeness) \u2014 not directly about constness but needed to fully analyze signatures.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE and _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE (macros): these affect which daemon fields are read and whether the function reads daemon fields; knowing which branch is compiled clarifies whether daemon is only read here (supporting const) or whether code elsewhere writes to daemon via this call chain.\n\nCollecting these symbols (prototypes/definitions and relevant implementations) lets the analyser determine whether pointers are only read and thus could be const, or are written to and therefore must remain non-const."
