  "explanation": "Why each is required for MISRA 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition) including fields: fdset_size_set_by_app and fdset_size\n  - The ternary controlling expression in the function is \"daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app\". To decide if that controlling expression can be considered invariant (always true or always false) we must know the exact declaration and semantics of that field: its type (e.g. plain int, bool, bit-field), whether it is declared const/volatile, and whether its value can be changed at runtime. We also need fdset_size only to understand the types used in the two branches of the ternary (not for invariance per se, but to confirm the expression context).\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE (preprocessor macro definition / whether defined)\n  - This #ifdef selects whether the ternary expression is present at compile time. If the macro is not defined, the conditional expression does not exist in the compiled code and there is no risk of an invariant controlling expression coming from that ternary. Therefore the analysis must know whether this macro is defined in the build configuration.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE (macro or constant definition and type)\n  - If HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE is not defined (or if the ternary resolves to a constant branch), the function will pass a compile-time constant value. Knowing the definition/type of this macro/constant helps determine whether the resulting controlling expression (in this function or related call sites) is a true invariant constant. Also confirms whether the value is an integer constant expression (relevant to MISRA exceptions).\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2 (prototype/declaration)\n  - While MHD_get_fdset2 is the callee rather than a controlling expression inside this function, its prototype shows the parameter types (particularly the type of the last parameter) and whether any further constraints/expectations exist (e.g. if the callee expects a compile-time constant). It also helps determine whether passing a constant (from _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE) vs. a runtime-chosen value changes the control-flow semantics relevant to MISRA. Including the prototype is useful to complete the local context for the call site analysis.\n\nNotes:\n- Other symbols such as fd_set, MHD_socket, or MHD_Result are not needed to decide whether the controlling expression in this function is invariant for the MISRA rule; the key facts are the presence of the preprocessor conditional and the nature (type/constness) of daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app and the default-size macro."
