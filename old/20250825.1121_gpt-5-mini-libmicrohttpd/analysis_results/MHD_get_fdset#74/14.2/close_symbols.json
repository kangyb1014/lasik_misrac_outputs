Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check the MISRA \u201cfor loop shall be well-formed\u201d rule for MHD_get_fdset:\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2 (full definition/source): MHD_get_fdset merely forwards to MHD_get_fdset2. Any for-loops (their headers and bodies) that could violate the rule will be in MHD_get_fdset2; the full source is needed to inspect the three clauses and any loop counters.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition): MHD_get_fdset conditionally passes daemon members to MHD_get_fdset2. The daemon structure definition is needed to know the types of members used as arguments (e.g. whether a member is boolean, integer, etc.) which affects whether a member can legally be a loop control flag or loop counter per MISRA.\n\n- MHD_Daemon::fdset_size_set_by_app (member type): This flag selects which fdset size is passed. Its type (Boolean-like or integer) determines whether it can serve as a loop control flag in a for-statement (MISRA restricts loop control flags to a single identifier with Boolean type).\n\n- MHD_Daemon::fdset_size (member type): The actual size value passed into MHD_get_fdset2 may be used as a loop bound or counter; the member type and range matter for checking that the loop counter/clauses only modify the loop counter and that no other object modified in the loop body is used in the header.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE (macro/constant): The default size passed when fdset_size_set_by_app is false. Its value and type are relevant for loop bounds and for determining if an object other than the loop counter is used in the for header.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE (compile-time macro): Affects which argument is actually passed to MHD_get_fdset2; both compile-time variants need checking because they change which symbols/objects appear in code (affects whether a non-counter object appears in the loop clauses).\n\n- MHD_DLOG (definition/prototype): MHD_get_fdset2 calls MHD_DLOG per the call graph. If MHD_DLOG is invoked inside a for-loop body (or if it modifies objects used in loop headers), its semantics (side effects) must be known because MISRA requires the second clause to have no persistent side effects and the third clause to modify only the loop counter.\n\n- MHD_add_to_fd_set_ (definition/prototype and body): This function likely manipulates fd_set and may be called inside loops in MHD_get_fdset2/internal_get_fdset2. Its body may modify objects used in loop headers or even modify potential loop counters \u2014 so its implementation is required to see whether called-from-loop behaviour breaks MISRA constraints.\n\n- internal_get_fdset2 (definition/prototype and body, and any functions it calls): It is a callee of MHD_get_fdset2 and may contain for-loops or call further functions. Per the MISRA rule, the behaviour of a for-loop body includes behaviour of any functions called within it; therefore the bodies of internal_get_fdset2 and its callees must be inspected.\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef): The max_fd parameter type may be used in loop bounds or be modified in loop bodies; its type is required to check whether objects in loop headers/bodies are permitted by MISRA.\n\n- fd_set (type) and FD_* macros/operations used by add/get functions: Those types/macros are the target of modifications inside the called functions. If fd_set objects (or other objects) are used in loop headers or modified in loop bodies, their usage must be examined for side effects or multiple-object modification of loop counters.\n\nSummary: the target function itself contains no for-loops, so to determine MISRA compliance we must inspect MHD_get_fdset2 and all functions it calls (and the data types/macros they touch) to find any for-loops and verify the three clauses and that called functions do not introduce side effects or modify loop counters or other objects used in the loop header. The listed symbols provide the necessary code, types and macro values to perform that analysis."
