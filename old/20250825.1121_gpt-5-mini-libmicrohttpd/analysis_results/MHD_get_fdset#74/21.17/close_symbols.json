  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_fdset (and the functions it directly calls) could violate the MISRA rule about out\u2011of\u2011bounds uses of the <string.h> functions, the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- MHD_get_fdset2: the direct callee. Its implementation must be inspected for any use of string.h functions (memcpy, memset, strlen, etc.) and to see how it uses the size parameter passed from MHD_get_fdset.\n\n- MHD_DLOG: called by MHD_get_fdset2 (per the call graph). Logging routines sometimes format or copy strings; include it to check for any string.h usage and the sizes/parameters they use.\n\n- MHD_add_to_fd_set_: called by MHD_get_fdset2. Likely manipulates fd_set objects or buffers; its implementation must be checked for memory/string operations that could read/write beyond buffer bounds.\n\n- internal_get_fdset2: another callee of MHD_get_fdset2. Must be analyzed for any string.h functions and how it interprets sizes and buffers passed through from MHD_get_fdset.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon: needed because MHD_get_fdset reads daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app and daemon->fdset_size. The layout/types of these members determine the value (and type) of the size argument passed down; this is critical to check whether buffer sizes used in string/memory functions are correct.\n\n- daemon->fdset_size_set_by_app: the boolean/flag used to decide whether to use daemon->fdset_size or the default; required to determine the actual size value passed to MHD_get_fdset2.\n\n- daemon->fdset_size: the application-provided fdset size. Its value and type are required to determine whether downstream memory/string ops could exceed object bounds.\n\n- _MHD_SYS_DEFAULT_FD_SETSIZE: the default size used when fdset_size is not set by the app. Needed to compute the effective size argument and compare with actual buffer/object sizes used downstream.\n\n- HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE: controls the compile-time selection of which size expression is used. The analyzer must know which branch is active to determine the exact size passed in the build being analyzed.\n\n- MHD_socket: typedef of the socket/integer type passed (max_fd). Some implementations use it for indexing or sizing; include to check for type/width issues that affect bounds calculations.\n\n- fd_set: definition of the fd_set object passed into MHD_get_fdset and forwarded to callees. Any mem* or string functions operating on fd_set buffers require the actual fd_set layout/size to verify bounds.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE: system constant used with fd_set. Necessary to verify assumptions about the maximum number of fds and the size of fd_set when downstream code uses FD_SETSIZE or related values to size memory/string operations.\n\nIncluding these symbols (the callee implementations plus the daemon fields, types and relevant macros/constants) lets the next analyst trace the size values passed into memory/string operations and inspect the implementations for any use of string.h functions that might access beyond object bounds."
