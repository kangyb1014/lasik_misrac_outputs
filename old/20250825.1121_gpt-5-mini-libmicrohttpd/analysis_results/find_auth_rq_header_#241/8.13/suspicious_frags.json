  "explanation": "I reviewed find_auth_rq_header_ and the related type definitions. There are no obvious violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in the provided code:\n\n- All pointers that are only used for reading are declared to point to const-qualified types: the function parameter c is const struct MHD_Connection *, the local iterator h is const struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *, token is const char *. The header and value members of MHD_HTTP_Req_Header are declared as const char *.\n\n- The string-literal macros (_MHD_AUTH_DIGEST_BASE, _MHD_AUTH_BASIC_BASE, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_AUTHORIZATION) are used via const char * pointers (token, and parameters to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_), and MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ itself takes const char *const parameters.\n\n- The only non-const pointer parameter in the function, struct _MHD_str_w_len *auth_value, is written to (auth_value->str and auth_value->len are assigned). Because it is an output parameter, it must be a non-const target and therefore should not be const-qualified.\n\n- Other non-const pointers in the provided MHD_Connection structure (link pointers, buffers, pool, socket_context, etc.) are presumably intended to be mutable (linked-list manipulation, read/write buffers, etc.), so non-const qualification is appropriate.\n\nGiven the above, there are no fragments in the provided code that appear to omit const qualification where it is feasible and appropriate under Rule 8.13."
