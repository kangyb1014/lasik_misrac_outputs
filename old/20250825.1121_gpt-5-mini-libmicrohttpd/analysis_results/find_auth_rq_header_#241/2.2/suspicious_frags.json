The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The only operations in the provided code that are actually executed yet have no effect on program behaviour are the mhd_assert invocations (and the macro that makes them no-ops). The mhd_assert macro is defined to expand to ((void)0), so every call compiles to a no-op statement; removing those statements would not change behaviour, which makes them candidates for dead-code investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2. All other code in the function is involved in meaningful control flow or data flow: - The conditional blocks selecting token/token_len (Digest vs Basic) are active given DAUTH_SUPPORT/BAUTH_SUPPORT and are required for correct header matching. - The loop over headers, the sequence of checks (kind, header size, token length, case-insensitive comparisons) and the subsequent computation of auth_value->str/len are necessary to locate and extract the authorization value; none of these statements are redundant or purely ornamental. - The return true / return false outcomes are functional and affect caller behaviour (e.g. MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_ depends on the boolean result). - Macro MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, string-comparison function, memory allocation, memset and parse_dauth_params usage are all functional and cannot be removed without changing behaviour. Therefore only the asserts (and their macro definition) are reported as suspicious for dead code; the rest of the code should not be investigated under Rule 2.2."
