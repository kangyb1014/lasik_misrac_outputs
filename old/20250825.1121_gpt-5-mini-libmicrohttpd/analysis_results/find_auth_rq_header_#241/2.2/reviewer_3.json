  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In the provided project configuration mhd_assert is defined as a no-op macro ((void)0). The statement mhd_assert(0); therefore produces no observable effect at runtime. That statement is syntactically reachable (it resides in a fallback branch that can be taken when the auth type is neither DIGEST nor BASIC), so it is an executed operation with no effect; removing that statement would not change the program behaviour in the given build. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (a project shall not contain dead code, defined as any executed operation whose removal would not affect behaviour), this constitutes dead code for the project as configured. Note: if mhd_assert were defined to perform runtime actions in other build configurations, the statement would not be dead in those builds, but the rule is applied to the actual project configuration (and with the provided macro definition it is a violation)."
