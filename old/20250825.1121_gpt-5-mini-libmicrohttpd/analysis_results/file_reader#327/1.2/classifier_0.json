  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The code performs a standard C cast to the typedef 'ssize_t' (return (ssize_t) bytes_read;). This is not a compiler language extension; 'ssize_t' is a platform/POSIX typedef rather than a compiler extension. Therefore Rule 1.2 (no language extensions) is not violated by this fragment. Note: portability concerns about use of non-standard POSIX types (ssize_t) are outside Rule 1.2, which targets compiler language extensions explicitly documented as such."
