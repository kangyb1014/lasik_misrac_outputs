  "explanation": "To decide whether any controlling expression in file_reader is invariant you must know the semantics, return domains and relevant types of the external symbols used in those expressions:\n\n- fseek: The controlling expression '0 != fseek(file, (long) pos, SEEK_SET)' depends on fseek's return values and side-effects (e.g. whether it can return different values for different pos/file). You need its prototype and runtime semantics (0 on success, non-zero on failure) to assess possible variability.\n\n- fread: The value of bytes_read is the return from fread(buf, 1, max, file). Determining whether '0 == bytes_read' can be invariant requires fread's behaviour (how it uses max, file position, EOF, and error conditions) and its return domain (size_t).\n\n- ferror: The nested conditional '(0 != ferror(file))' is a controlling expression; its variability depends on ferror's semantics (when it can return non-zero) and whether calling fread/fseek can change the error indicator.\n\n- SEEK_SET: The origin argument passed to fseek; while a macro, its value is part of the fseek invocation and needed to reason about fseek behaviour (positioning semantics).\n\n- FILE: The type of 'file' (FILE *) is required to understand what state fseek/fread/ferror operate on and whether those calls can have variable effects.\n\n- ssize_t, size_t, uint64_t: The integer types and their ranges/representations affect casts and comparisons (e.g. (long) pos, conversion between uint64_t and long/size_t). Type widths can influence whether expressions become effectively constant or overflow/truncate, which matters for MISRA's invariant-check.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: Although not part of the controlling expressions, their definitions are relevant to understand the function's intended control-flow and whether returns are constant signaling paths; include them so the analyzer has full context of the function's observable outcomes.\n\nWith these symbols (declarations and semantic descriptions) the next agent can determine whether each controlling expression can vary at runtime or is effectively invariant under the environments of interest."
