  "scenario": "Not violated. The FILE object is used with fseek/fread which require a modifiable FILE stream, so the pointer must refer to a non-const FILE; therefore casting the void* cls to FILE * is appropriate. A violation would occur if the underlying object were const (e.g. const FILE * or const data) but the code cast away constness \u2014 for example: const FILE *cf; void *cls = (void *)cf; FILE *file = (FILE *)cls; \u2014 which would remove const qualification and violate Rule 8.13."
