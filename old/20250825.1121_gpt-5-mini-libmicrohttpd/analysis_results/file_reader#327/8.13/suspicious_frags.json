  "explanation": "I have included the code locations where pointer types are introduced or used so they can be checked for appropriate const qualification. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce pointer targets that could or should be const-qualified: - The numeric parameters (pos, max) are integer types, not pointers. - The cast (long) pos and the fseek return handling involve integer operations and error handling, not pointer target qualification. - The local scalar bytes_read and the ssize_t return/value conversions are non-pointer operations. - The return macros (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM) are control values, not pointer types. - The comment and formatting lines are non-code. These elements cannot affect whether pointer targets should be const-qualified under Rule 8.13, so they need not be investigated for that rule."
