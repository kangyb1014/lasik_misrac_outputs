  "explanation": "To decide whether the function should use const-qualified pointer parameters, the analyzer must know how the pointers are used by called library functions and what types those functions require:\n\n- fread: The first parameter is void * (non-const) and fread writes data into that buffer. Knowing the exact prototype proves that 'buf' is a writable destination and therefore must not be const.\n\n- fseek: Takes a FILE * (non-const). Knowing this prototype shows that operations on the object referenced by 'cls' expect a mutable FILE, so 'cls' cannot be a pointer-to-const FILE.\n\n- ferror: Takes a FILE * (non-const). Confirms that callers examine/operate on the FILE object via a non-const pointer.\n\n- FILE: The FILE type definition (typedef/struct) from <stdio.h> is required to confirm the type that 'cls' is being cast to and to ensure there is no API variant using a const-qualified FILE. Together with the function prototypes above, this demonstrates that both 'buf' and the FILE object are used mutably and therefore should not be declared as pointers-to-const under the MISRA guideline."
