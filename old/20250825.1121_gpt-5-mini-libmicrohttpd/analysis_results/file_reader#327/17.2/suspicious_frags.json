  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for recursive calls under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. Rationale: \n- The function file_reader does not call itself directly. There is no invocation of file_reader within its body. \n- There are no function-pointer dereferences or callbacks invoked inside file_reader that could indirectly call file_reader. The only pointer parameter (cls) is cast to FILE * and used solely as the FILE handle for standard I/O calls. \n- The only function calls inside file_reader are standard library calls (fseek, fread, ferror) which are not application callbacks and do not invoke user-defined functions such as file_reader. \n- The return expressions use integer macros (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM) and casts; these are constant values and do not involve function calls. \nGiven these points, there is no direct or indirect recursion present in the provided code, so no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.2."
