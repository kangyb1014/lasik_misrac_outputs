  "explanation": "I found no calls to any of the Standard Library string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The function only uses fseek, fread and ferror; none are in the string.h set that this rule targets, so there are no direct Rule 21.17 issues to investigate in this snippet.\n\nNotes (not flagged as suspicious under Rule 21.17):\n- fread(buf, 1, max, file) reads up to max bytes into buf. Although this is not a string.h call and thus outside Rule 21.17, it is a potential source of out-of-bounds accesses if the caller passes a max larger than the actual size of buf. That is a general buffer-safety concern but not a Rule 21.17 violation.\n- The cast (long) pos passed to fseek may truncate a large pos value on platforms where long is smaller than uint64_t; this is a portability/safety issue but not related to Rule 21.17.\n\nTherefore, no code fragments are selected for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
