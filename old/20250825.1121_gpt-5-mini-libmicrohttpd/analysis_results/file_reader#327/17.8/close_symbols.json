  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for the MISRA rule check:\n\n- fseek: Need its prototype/definition to confirm it does not modify the caller's 'file' or any of the function parameters (it takes arguments by value). Also to check whether it might be a macro with side effects that could modify parameters.\n\n- fread: Must verify its prototype (void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream) to ensure it writes to the object pointed to by 'buf' (which is allowed) but does not modify the 'buf' pointer parameter itself. Also to detect any macro redefinition with side effects.\n\n- ferror: Check prototype to ensure it only inspects the FILE stream and does not modify pointer parameters.\n\n- FILE: Type definition for the 'file' parameter (cls cast). Needed to confirm that passing 'file' to library functions does not imply modification of the function parameter itself beyond allowed object modifications.\n\n- SEEK_SET: Macro value used with fseek; include to ensure it is a simple constant and not a function-like macro that could modify parameters.\n\n- ssize_t: Return type of the target function; include to ensure no hidden semantics change the parameters (and to fully understand returned values in relation to MISRA reporting).\n\n- uint64_t: Type of 'pos'; used to verify that the cast (long) pos is a value conversion and does not modify the parameter variable. Also to confirm whether any implementation-specific behaviour could imply modification.\n\n- size_t: Type of 'max'; needed to confirm calls that take 'max' (fread) receive it by value and do not modify the parameter.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: These return-value macros/constants must be inspected to ensure they are not function-like macros or expressions with side effects that could modify function parameters.\n\nIn short: inspect the prototypes/types/macros above to ensure none of them are implemented in a way (e.g., as function-like macros or functions taking pointers by reference) that would result in the target function modifying its parameter variables (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
