  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The void* parameter cls is cast to a local FILE* variable (FILE *file = (FILE *) cls), which does not modify the parameter itself. The integer parameter pos is only cast to long when passed to fseek (no assignment to pos). The pointer parameter buf is passed to fread, which may modify the object it points to \u2014 this is permitted by the rule \u2014 and the pointer itself is not changed. The size parameter max is only used as an argument and not modified. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
