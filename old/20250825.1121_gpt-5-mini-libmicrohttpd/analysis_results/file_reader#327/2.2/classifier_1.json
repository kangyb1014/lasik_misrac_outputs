  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of file_reader:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nfile_reader (void *cls, uint64_t pos, char *buf, size_t max)\n{\n  FILE *file = (FILE *) cls;\n  size_t bytes_read;\n\n  /* 'fseek' may not support files larger 2GiB, depending on platform.\n   * For production code, make sure that 'pos' has valid values, supported by\n   * 'fseek', or use 'fseeko' or similar function. */\n  if (0 != fseek (file, (long) pos, SEEK_SET))\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  bytes_read = fread (buf, 1, max, file);\n  if (0 == bytes_read)\n    return (0 != ferror (file)) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the statement 'return (ssize_t) bytes_read;' is executed when fread returns a non\u2011zero number of bytes. Removing it would change the function's observable behaviour (no length would be returned), so it is not dead code."
