The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "tool_params (definition / type): The function reads and writes members of this object; the types of those members (e.g. boolean, int, bit-field) determine whether assignments like 'tool_params.unique = !0' or reads used in conditions have side effects or interact with loop-control rules.\n\ntool_params.shared (member): Used in the first if-condition. Its type and semantics (whether it's a simple boolean/volatile/bit-field) are needed to ensure no hidden side-effects that could affect for-loop well-formedness when this function is used inside a for-loop or called from inside a for loop body.\n\ntool_params.single (member): Same rationale as .shared: used in a conditional test; its type/attributes matter for determining if evaluation has persistent side-effects forbidden in the second clause of a for.\n\ntool_params.unique (member): Assigned in this function ('= !0'); its type (boolean/int/bit-field/volatile) is needed to check that this write does not violate the \"only modify loop counter\" or \"only one loop counter\" constraints if this function is invoked inside a for loop or if unique could be used as a loop counter elsewhere.\n\nenum PerfRepl_param_result (definition): Return type of the function; definitions of the enumerators clarify that return values are simple constants and not function-like macros that might contain side effects or hidden control flow relevant to loop analysis.\n\nPERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: The concrete definitions (macros or enum constants) are needed to ensure they are simple constant expressions with no side effects (e.g., not macros that expand to function calls or expressions containing loops).\n\nfprintf (prototype): This function is called in the target function. The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the for-loop body; knowing the prototype/declaration (and whether the implementation has side effects relevant to loop-control) is necessary to reason about whether calls introduce forbidden side-effects when used in for loop clauses or bodies.\n\nstderr (symbol): The stream argument passed to fprintf; its identity and linkage clarify that passing it is a simple expression (no hidden modifications) and whether using it could constitute a side-effect relevant to loop-clause rules.\n\nNote: process_param__unique itself contains no for loops. The above symbols are the minimal additional declarations/definitions required to determine whether this function (or calls it makes) could violate MISRA's \"well-formed for\" constraints (e.g., by performing modifications or side-effects that would conflict with loop-counter/loop-clause rules when this function is used in or affects a for loop)."
