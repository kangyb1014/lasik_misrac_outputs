  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n- The function uses standard C constructs only: static function storage, an enum return type, const char * parameter, if statements, fprintf, assignment, and the conditional (?:) operator.\n- The expression \"! 0\" is a standard C unary logical-not applied to an integer constant (yields 1), not a compiler extension.\n- The character comparison '-' == param_name[1] and ternary return are standard C operations.\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs present (no __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions, pragma extensions, inline assembly, GCC/Clang builtins, or other documented compiler extensions).\n- No nonstandard headers or language features (C++ features, variable-length arrays as an extension, or nonstandard casting) are present.\n\nTherefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions detected)."
