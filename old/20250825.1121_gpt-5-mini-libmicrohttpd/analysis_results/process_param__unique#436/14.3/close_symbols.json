  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for checking the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions:\n\n- tool_params: Need the declaration/definition (type, linkage, initialization) to know whether the object can change at runtime or is effectively constant/immutable (e.g. declared const, static with no writers, or volatile). That determines whether 'if (tool_params.shared)' / 'if (tool_params.single)' are invariant.\n\n- tool_params.shared: The controlling expression directly tests this field. You must know its type (boolean/int), initial value, and whether any code can modify it; otherwise you cannot determine if the condition is potentially invariant.\n\n- tool_params.single: Same reason as .shared: the second if() controls on this field; need its declaration and any writers to assess invariance.\n\n- tool_params.unique: This function assigns to tool_params.unique. Knowing the field's type and semantics helps verify that the assignment is valid and whether subsequent uses could affect other controlling expressions (and to confirm it is not const).\n\n- process_param__shared: This likely sets tool_params.shared. Analyze its body to see whether it (and only it) changes .shared and under what circumstances; necessary to show that .shared is not immutable or to identify invariance.\n\n- process_param__single: Same as above for .single: examine all writers to .single so you can judge whether the controlling expression can vary.\n\n- process_short_param: Caller that invokes process_param__unique. You need to inspect how param_name is constructed/passed at call sites here to determine whether param_name[1] is a constant value (which would make '-' == param_name[1] invariant) or variable.\n\n- process_long_param: Same as process_short_param \u2014 another caller path; its argument construction may differ, so both callers must be checked to decide if param_name[1] can vary.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result: The function return type. Not required to judge invariance per se, but include to allow the analyzer to parse and type-check the function and understand the return expressions.\n\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR: Returned on error branches. Including this symbol helps static checking/type resolution (not required for invariance logic but useful to fully analyze the function).\n\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR: Returned when param_name[1] equals '-'. Included so an analyzer can parse the ternary return expression and confirm it has no side-effects that would affect invariance.\n\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: Same rationale as PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR for completing the ternary expression analysis.\n\n(Notes: Standard I/O symbols such as fprintf and stderr are not needed to assess whether the controlling expressions are invariant because they do not affect the values tested. The primary concerns are the fields tested (.shared, .single), all writers to those fields (the two process_param__* helpers), and the call sites that pass param_name to determine whether param_name[1] is constant across calls.)"
