  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in the function signature is 'const char *param_name', which already points to a const-qualified type as the rule requires. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-typed variables in the provided function or related definitions (tool_params is a static object, not a pointer; the enum has no pointers). The use of param_name (indexing param_name[1]) and passing it to fprintf does not introduce a non-const pointer declaration that would violate Rule 8.13. Therefore there are no places in the supplied code that violate or potentially violate the requirement that pointers be const-qualified when possible."
