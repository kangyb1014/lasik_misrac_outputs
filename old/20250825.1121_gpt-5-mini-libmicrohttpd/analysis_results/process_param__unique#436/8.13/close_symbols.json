  "explanation": "- tool_params: The function reads and writes members of this global; to check whether any pointer const-qualification issues arise (or whether members are declared as pointer-to-const or modifiable), the complete definition of tool_params is required.\n- tool_params.shared / tool_params.single: Their types matter (e.g. plain int, bool, or pointer). If they are pointer types, MISRA's pointer-to-const rule could be relevant. Knowing their exact declarations is needed to determine if const qualification is appropriate.\n- tool_params.unique: The function assigns to this member. Its type (and whether it should be const-qualified or is a pointer) is required to judge compliance with the pointer-to-const rule.\n- type of tool_params (struct/typedef definition): The struct/typedef declaration gives the member types and const qualifiers necessary to evaluate whether any pointer members should be const-qualified.\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result: The return type of the function; include to ensure return expressions match the declared enum and to see if any values involve pointers (unlikely, but for completeness).\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR / PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR / PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: The specific enum constants returned; include to validate there are no pointer-related conversions or hidden pointer-return semantics.\n- fprintf: The function is called with param_name as a %s argument. The declaration/prototype of fprintf (and its expectation for the %s argument) is required to determine whether passing a const char * to the varargs %s is a const-qualification violation under MISRA.\n- stderr: The stream argument type (FILE*) is part of the fprintf call; include to fully understand the fprintf invocation context.\n- prototype of fprintf (stdio.h declaration): Explicit prototype clarifies that the format parameter is const char * and that the %s argument is passed through varargs (no prototype-enforced conversion), which is necessary to reason about any const-to-non-const pointer issues flagged by MISRA.\n\nNote: The parameter param_name itself is declared const char * in the target function, so the main potential MISRA concern is the use of that const pointer in the varargs fprintf call and any interactions with global tool_params member types. The listed symbols provide the missing declarations needed to make a precise MISRA C assessment."
