  "explanation": "memset: needed to confirm that the routine writes into the memory pointed to by its first argument (signature void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n)). If memset modifies the buffer, buf cannot be const-qualified. All call sites of data_generator: to decide whether the parameter void *cls could be const-qualified you must inspect every caller and see what is passed as cls (is it a pointer to mutable data? is the caller expecting to modify through the pointer?). The actual argument expressions at each call determine whether const is feasible and whether changing the parameter type would break callers. The function-pointer / callback prototype or API type: if data_generator is used as a callback (assigned to a function pointer or passed to an API), the expected prototype dictates which qualifiers are permitted. That prototype may already require a non-const or const pointer and will constrain whether you can change the parameter qualifiers. Typedefs/declarations for ssize_t, size_t, uint64_t: include these basic type declarations so the analyzer knows these are integer types (not pointers) and to avoid false positives when reasoning about pointer const qualification. Together these symbols let an analyzer determine whether each pointer parameter can safely be declared const without changing semantics or breaking assignments to existing callback types."
