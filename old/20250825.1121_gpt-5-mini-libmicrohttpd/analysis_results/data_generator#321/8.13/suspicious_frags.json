  "explanation": "The only pointer parameter that could reasonably be const-qualified is cls; it is unused and the function does not modify the pointee, so it should be investigated to determine if it should be declared const void *cls. The buf parameter is written to (memset and buf[79] = '\\n'), so it must remain a non-const char * and should not be investigated for const-qualification. pos is an integer, not a pointer. The casts (void) pos; are for silencing unused warnings and involve no pointer qualification changes. No other pointer occurrences exist in the function that could be made const-qualified."
