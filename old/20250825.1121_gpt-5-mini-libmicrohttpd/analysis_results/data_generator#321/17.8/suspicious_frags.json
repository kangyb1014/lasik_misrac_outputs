  "explanation": "No function parameter is being assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The (void) cls and (void) pos lines merely suppress unused-parameter warnings and do not change parameter values. The code reads the value of max (allowed) and returns early if max < 80. The calls that change memory (memset(buf, ...); buf[79] = '\\n';) modify the object pointed to by the pointer parameter buf, which is explicitly permitted by the MISRA Rule 17.8 note; the pointer variable buf itself is not modified (no assignments like buf = ... or pointer arithmetic such as buf++). Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be investigated for this rule."
