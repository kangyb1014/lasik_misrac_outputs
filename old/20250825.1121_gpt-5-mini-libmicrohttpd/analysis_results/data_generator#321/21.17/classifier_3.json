  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown code: the function checks if (max < 80) return 0; so when buf[79] is written it is guaranteed that max >= 80 and index 79 is within the provided buffer length indicated by max. A possible violation scenario would be if the caller passes an inconsistent pair (buf, max) where buf actually points to a smaller allocation than max (e.g. buf points to a 64\u2011byte buffer but max is 80); in that case buf[79] (and the preceding memset) would access beyond the buffer and violate the rule."
