  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 21.17: the (void) cls; and (void) pos; lines are just unused-parameter casts and do not perform memory accesses. The function signature and enclosing braces contain no string.h calls or pointer indexing. No other standard string functions (strcpy, strncpy, strcat, etc.) are used in this snippet. The flagged lines are the only places where a standard library memory function is used or where an explicit buffer index is written; hence they are the relevant fragments to inspect for potential out-of-bounds accesses."
