  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in shown code as written: the function returns early when max < 80, so when memset(buf, 'A', max - 1) is executed max >= 80 and the call writes max-1 bytes (indices 0..max-2), which is within a buffer of size max. A violation would occur if the caller supplies an incorrect max that is larger than the actual object size (for example, buf actually points to a 64-byte array but max is 80 \u2014 then memset(buf, 'A', 79) would write beyond the 64-byte object)."
