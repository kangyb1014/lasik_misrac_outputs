  "explanation": "The only function called by data_generator is memset. To prove absence of direct or indirect recursion you must inspect the actual symbol bound to memset in the build (could be the C library implementation, a compiler builtin, or a user-supplied/replacement function or macro). Therefore include the definition/implementation (and its transitive callees) of memset (and any macro/alias such as a user-defined memset or __builtin_memset) so you can determine whether that call chain ever reaches data_generator. No other functions are called by data_generator; the parameter and type symbols (ssize_t, size_t, uint64_t) are not relevant to the recursion rule."
