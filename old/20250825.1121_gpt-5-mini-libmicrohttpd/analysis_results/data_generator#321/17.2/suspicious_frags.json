  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function body contains only two unused-parameter casts, a simple max check, a call to memset, a direct buffer assignment, and a return. There are no direct calls to data_generator, no other function calls that could call back into data_generator, and no use of function pointers or callbacks (the void *cls parameter is unused), so neither direct nor indirect recursion is present in this code fragment."
