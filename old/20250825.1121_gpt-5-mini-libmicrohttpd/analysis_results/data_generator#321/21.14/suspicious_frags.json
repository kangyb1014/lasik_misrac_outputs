  "explanation": "I found no use of memcmp in the provided code. The function data_generator only calls memset and performs a direct assignment to buf[79]; it does not perform any string comparisons or call any string-comparison library functions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which targets use of memcmp on null-terminated strings). If additional files or macros that might expand to memcmp calls are present elsewhere, those should be checked, but within the supplied code there are no memcmp uses to inspect."
