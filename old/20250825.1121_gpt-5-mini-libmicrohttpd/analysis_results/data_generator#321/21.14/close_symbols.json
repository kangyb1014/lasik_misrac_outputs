  "explanation": "memset \u2014 data_generator calls memset to fill the buffer; you must inspect the memset symbol (standard implementation/prototype) and its use here to confirm that it only fills bytes and does not append a terminating NUL. This establishes whether the produced buffer is a NUL-terminated C string (it is not in this function). memcmp \u2014 the MISRA rule is about uses of memcmp on NUL-terminated strings, so you must locate the memcmp symbol (its call sites and semantics) to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare a NUL-terminated string vs another string or literal. all callers of data_generator \u2014 the generator itself does not call memcmp, so to decide if the rule is violated you must examine every function that calls data_generator to see how they treat the returned/filled buffer (as a raw byte buffer or as a NUL-terminated string). call sites of memcmp that take data_generator's buf as an argument \u2014 specifically identify any memcmp calls where one of the operands is the buffer produced by data_generator; inspect their length arguments and whether the other operand is a NUL-terminated string or literal. allocations/declarations of the buffer(s) passed as buf to data_generator \u2014 you need the symbols that declare/allocate the actual buffer objects passed in (their sizes and intended use) to determine whether callers expect/require NUL-termination (string semantics) and therefore whether a subsequent memcmp would be comparing NUL-terminated strings. Together these symbols let an analyzer trace data flow from generator \u2192 buffer \u2192 comparator and decide if memcmp is being (incorrectly) used on NUL-terminated strings."
