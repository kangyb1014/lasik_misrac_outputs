  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The identifiers and constructs are standard or library/OS-provided types and idioms rather than compiler-specific extensions:\n- uint64_t is from the standard <stdint.h> (ISO C99) and is not a compiler extension.\n- ssize_t is a platform/OS typedef (commonly provided by POSIX headers); it is not a compiler language extension as described in compiler documentation. If project policy disallows POSIX types, that is a portability or compliance issue but not a compiler-extension violation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as specified.\n- The (void) parameter casts to suppress unused-parameter warnings are standard C idiom, not an extension.\n- Use of memset and standard types like size_t are standard library/C types.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that explicitly use compiler extensions that must be reported for investigation under Rule 1.2."
