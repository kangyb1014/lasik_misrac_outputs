Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of data_generator:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\ndata_generator (void *cls, uint64_t pos, char *buf, size_t max)\n{\n  (void) cls; /* Unused.

  "scenario": "The final 'return 80;' is executed when max >= 80 and provides the function's result (the number of bytes generated). Removing it would change program behaviour (reaching the end of a non-void function causes undefined behaviour), so the operation is not dead code."
