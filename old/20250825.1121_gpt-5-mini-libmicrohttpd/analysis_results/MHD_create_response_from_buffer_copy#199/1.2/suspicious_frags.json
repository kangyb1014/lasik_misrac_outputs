  "explanation": "The only explicit compiler language extension present is the GNU/Clang attribute usage: __attribute__((visibility(\"default\"))) as defined by the macro _MHD_EXTERN and as applied to the function declaration. That attribute is an extension documented by compilers and therefore should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Other parts of the code do not use language extensions: malloc, memcpy, free, size_t, NULL comparisons, struct member access, function calls, and the &free function-pointer expression are standard C constructs and standard library usage (not compiler language extensions). No inline assembly, typeof, statement-expressions, non-standard storage-class specifiers, or other compiler-specific keywords/attributes are present elsewhere in the provided code."
