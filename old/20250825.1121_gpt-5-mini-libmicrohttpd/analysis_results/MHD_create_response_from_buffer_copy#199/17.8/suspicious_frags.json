  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying function parameters (the pointer parameter itself must not be changed; the object pointed to may be modified). In this function the parameters are: size (value parameter) and buffer (const void *). There are no assignments to either parameter (no 'size = ...' or 'buffer = ...'), only reads of size and use of buffer as the source in memcpy (which does not modify the object pointed to). mhd_copy is a local pointer (assigned from malloc) and r->data_buffer_size is a member of the returned struct \u2014 modifying that struct member does not violate Rule 17.8 because it is not a function parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that modify a function parameter and require investigation under Rule 17.8."
