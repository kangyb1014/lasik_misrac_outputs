  "explanation": "No controlling expression in this function is invariant. The function contains: - if (NULL == connection) \u2014 depends on the connection parameter; - if (NULL == key) \u2014 depends on the key parameter; - two for loops: for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next) \u2014 the loop condition depends on the mutable local pointer pos (and pos is advanced each iteration); - the inner if conditions (e.g. (0 != (kind & pos->kind)), (NULL == pos->header), (key_size == pos->header_size), (key == pos->header), and the call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_(...)) all depend on runtime values or function results. There are no while(1)/for(;;) infinite loops or do-while loops with constant controlling expressions. Therefore none of the controlling expressions appear to be compile-time or invariant constants that would trigger Rule 14.3 concerns."
