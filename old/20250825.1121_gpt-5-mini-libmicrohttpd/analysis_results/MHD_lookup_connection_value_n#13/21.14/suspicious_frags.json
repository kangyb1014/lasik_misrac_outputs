  "explanation": "I found no uses of the standard library function memcmp in the provided code fragments. The string comparisons in MHD_lookup_connection_value_n are done either by length-checked binary comparison (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_) or by a char-by-char loop (MHD_str_equal_caseless_). Specifically:\n\n- The branch that compares keys first checks key_size == pos->header_size, then calls MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ which iterates exactly len bytes and does not rely on or call memcmp nor on null-termination.\n- The caseless comparison MHD_str_equal_caseless_ walks characters until a '\\0' is reached but implements the comparison with explicit character reads and tests, not by calling memcmp.\n\nTherefore, there are no code fragments here that use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and thus no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If there are other source files or helper functions (not shown) that call memcmp for string comparison, those would be the relevant suspicious fragments to report."
