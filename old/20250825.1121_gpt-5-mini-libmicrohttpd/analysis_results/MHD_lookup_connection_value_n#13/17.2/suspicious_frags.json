  "explanation": "The only function call in this function body is MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_. To check MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect recursion), that callee must be investigated to ensure it does not call back\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014into MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (or otherwise create a recursion cycle). No other function calls are present in this code fragment: the for-loops traverse a linked list via pos->next (pointer access, not a function call), the checks (NULL comparisons, assignments to *value_ptr and *value_size_ptr) are simple operations that cannot introduce recursion, and MHD_YES/MHD_NO are return values (enum/constants), not function calls. The linkage macro (_MHD_EXTERN) and struct field accesses are not function calls either. Therefore only the shown call site requires further investigation for indirect recursion."
