  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.17 concern is about use of string handling functions that may access beyond object bounds. In this function the only call that can trigger such behavior (directly or indirectly) is MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, which is passed key, pos->header and key_size; therefore the entire conditional that compares key_size with pos->header_size and then calls MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ must be investigated to ensure no out-of-bounds access. The pointer-equality branch (key == pos->header) avoids any string access. No other calls to standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code, and simple pointer checks, loop traversal, and the assignments to *value_ptr and *value_size_ptr do not themselves invoke string handling and thus do not need investigation under Rule 21.17 here."
