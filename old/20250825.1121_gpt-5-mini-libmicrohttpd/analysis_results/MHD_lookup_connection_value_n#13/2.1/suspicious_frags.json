  "explanation": "I inspected the provided functions and related definitions for unreachable-code issues (MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1). The two fragments above are the only places that plausibly indicate unreachable- or preprocessor-related problematic code that should be investigated further:\n\n- The enum / macro snippet: the enum constant MHD_RESPONSE_HEADER_KIND is declared and then a macro with the identical name is defined immediately afterwards inside the enum block. That macro body then contains the same token name again. This is a highly suspicious construct at preprocessing/compilation time and can lead to unexpected preprocessing behavior, redefinition problems, or effectively dead/unparsable code paths. It warrants close examination of the macro expansion and how it interacts with the enum declaration across translation units.\n\n- The switch default that calls mhd_assert(0): this indicates the author believes the default is unreachable; however, an assert manifests as behavior only in certain builds and the default label can be reached if the enumerated variable takes an unexpected value. This pattern should be reviewed to confirm whether the default branch is truly impossible (otherwise the code is reachable and must handle that case rather than relying on an assertion), or whether the default is indeed impossible and can be removed or handled differently to satisfy MISRA.\n\nWhy other fragments were not selected:\n- The body of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n contains straightforward conditional checks, loops that can terminate by pos==NULL or by break, and subsequent checks (if (NULL == pos) return ...). I found no code statements that are syntactically unreachable (e.g., statements after an unconditional return) nor any constant conditions that render branches impossible.\n- parse_connection_headers logic uses conditional returns and nested if/else chains; each return is reachable based on the checked conditions. There are no statements following an unconditional return in the same block that would be unreachable.\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ contains multiple conditional returns and finishing with an allocation and an assertion. Although the assertion documents an invariant, the code path to the allocation is reachable when the earlier checks succeed, so there is no unreachable code fragment there.\n- parse_cookie_header contains normal control flow with a switch covering explicit cases; the default was the only suspicious statement (reported above). The final (void) saved_tail; inclusion under #ifndef HAVE_MESSAGES is conditional compilation to avoid an unused-variable warning and is not intrinsically unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can expand the investigation: show preprocessed output around the enum+macro to determine whether the macro redefinition makes code unreachable or causes preprocessing issues, and inspect all switch statements for other assert-based defaults."
