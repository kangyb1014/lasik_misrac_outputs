  "explanation": "Reason each symbol is required for analyzing MISRA \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\":\n\n- cpuset_t (type definition)\n  - You must know the actual type that cpuset_ptr points to to determine whether it is intended to be modified, and whether a const-qualified pointer (const cpuset_t *) would be semantically appropriate.\n\n- cpuid_t (type definition)\n  - Needed to check whether cpuid_t is a plain integer type used only as an index (read-only) when passed to cpuset_isset; this affects whether the cpuset API should be const-correct for read operations.\n\n- cpuset_create (prototype)\n  - To see its return type and any qualifiers. If it returns a non-const pointer to a freshly allocated object that is meant to be written by other APIs, cpuset_ptr cannot always be const; conversely, if it returns a pointer to mutable storage but only some APIs modify it, constness can be applied to read-only API parameters.\n\n- cpuset_size (prototype)\n  - To know whether it takes (const cpuset_t *) or (cpuset_t *). If cpuset_size does not modify the set, it should accept a const pointer; confirming its prototype is necessary to assess whether a const qualification could be used safely here.\n\n- cpuset_isset (prototype)\n  - This call reads bits from the cpuset. If its prototype declares the cpuset parameter as const cpuset_t *, then the API is already const-correct for reads; if it takes a non-const pointer, that may indicate a potential MISRA const-qualification violation in the API and/or this code.\n\n- cpuset_destroy (prototype)\n  - Typically frees or mutates internal state. If it requires a non-const cpuset_t *, then the object must be non-const at destruction time; knowing its prototype is needed to reason about where const qualification is permitted.\n\n- sched_getaffinity_np (prototype)\n  - Crucial: this function almost certainly writes the mask into the provided cpuset buffer. Its parameter type and constness determine whether cpuset_ptr must be mutable at the point of the call; if it writes the mask, cpuset_ptr cannot be const for the duration prior to that call.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_ (prototype)\n  - Included because it is called conditionally when ret == 0. While it does not take cpuset_ptr, it affects control flow and return-value semantics; its prototype (return type and side effects) is useful to determine whether cpuset handling could be rearranged to allow const qualification elsewhere.\n\n- sysconf (prototype) and _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN (macro)\n  - sysconf is used to obtain a number of processors; while not directly about pointer constness, knowing whether this code path executes (via the macro and return semantics) is necessary to analyze whether cpuset_ptr is only read after being populated, which informs where const could be applied.\n\n- getpid (prototype)\n  - Used as an argument to sched_getaffinity_np; included for completeness to understand sched_getaffinity_np parameter types. Not directly about pointer constness, but needed to fully inspect the affinity call signature.\n\nSummary: to determine whether cpuset_ptr (and the APIs that accept it) should be const-qualified according to MISRA, you must examine the type definitions and the prototypes of every function that creates, writes to, reads from, or destroys the cpuset object (cpuset_create, sched_getaffinity_np, cpuset_size, cpuset_isset, cpuset_destroy). The additional items (sysconf/_SC_..., getpid, and the SysCtl helper) are included to understand control flow and when the cpuset is only read vs written, which affects where const qualification is permissible."
