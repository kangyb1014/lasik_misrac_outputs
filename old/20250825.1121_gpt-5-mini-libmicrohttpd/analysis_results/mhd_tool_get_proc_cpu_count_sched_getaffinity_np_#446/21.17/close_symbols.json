  "explanation": "The target function itself contains no direct calls to <string.h> functions, but it calls and depends on several external symbols whose implementations or type/layout determine whether any string handling functions are used or whether memory/buffer bounds might be violated. For each symbol:\n\n- cpuset_create: allocates/initializes the cpuset buffer passed to sched_getaffinity_np; must inspect implementation to ensure it does not use string functions and that the returned object is a correctly sized/initialized buffer.\n- cpuset_destroy: frees the cpuset buffer; check for any string.h use in its implementation (unlikely but necessary for completeness).\n- cpuset_size: provides the size (bytes) passed to sched_getaffinity_np. Critical to verify that the size is correct for the object returned by cpuset_create so sched_getaffinity_np will not copy/paste/resize beyond bounds.\n- cpuset_isset: used to probe bits of the cpuset and relied on for loop termination semantics (code tests >0 and >=0). Need its return-value semantics and whether it can perform out-of-bounds memory access internally (and whether it uses string.h functions internally).\n- cpuset_t: the type/layout of the cpuset object \u2014 required to determine buffer size, alignment and how cpuset_size relates to the object memory; also to reason about any internal string-like operations.\n- cpuid_t: the type of cpu index used in cpuset_isset/loops \u2014 size/sign affect loop bounds and index promotions that could lead to out-of-bounds indexing.\n- sched_getaffinity_np: this call writes into the cpuset buffer using the size from cpuset_size. You must inspect its prototype and implementation to ensure it does not invoke string.h functions that can access beyond provided buffer and that passing cpuset_size(cpuset_ptr) is safe.\n- getpid: provides pid argument to sched_getaffinity_np; include to be thorough (not directly string-related but part of the call chain).\n- sysconf and _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN: used to determine max_num; their behavior controls which iteration branch is taken. Inspect sysconf's usage only to confirm it does not introduce string operations that could lead to out-of-bounds in subsequent logic.\n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_: called in the NetBSD-specific fallback when ret==0; its implementation must be examined for any string.h usage or unsafe buffer handling that could violate the rule.\n- HAVE_SCHED_GETAFFINITY_NP, HAVE_GETPID, HAVE_SYSCONF, HAVE_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF, __NetBSD__: the preprocessor symbols control which code paths are compiled. You must know which of these are defined in the build being analyzed so you can limit the analysis to the actually compiled code paths (and therefore the relevant functions/implementations to inspect for string.h usage).\n\nIn short, to determine compliance with the MISRA rule about string handling you must inspect the implementations and prototypes of the above symbols (and the compile-time macros that select code paths) to ensure no call to any <string.h> routine occurs and that any buffer-length parameters passed (especially the cpuset buffer and its size) are correct so that no out-of-bounds access can result."
