First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I examined the provided function digest_get_size and the related macro definitions. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the structure and contents of for statements (requirements on the three clauses, loop counters, and side effects). There are no for statements in digest_get_size, nor in the additional macro definitions shown. The function contains only assertions, preprocessor-conditioned if statements that return constant-sized macros, an assertion that should not be reached, and a final return. The macros shown (mhd_assert, MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE, MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT) expand to constants or to ((void)0) and do not introduce any for loops. Conditional compilation could change which return is compiled in, but none of the provided snippets can expand to a for statement. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 14.2 to investigate."
