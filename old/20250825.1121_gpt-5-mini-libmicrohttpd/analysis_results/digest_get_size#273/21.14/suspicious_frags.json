  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function digest_get_size and the related definitions. There are no uses of the C standard library function memcmp (nor strcmp/strncmp) anywhere in the given code fragments. The code only performs enum/macros numeric comparisons (e.g. MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_* == da->algo) and returns compile-time size macros; there is no handling of char pointers or null-terminated strings in these fragments. Therefore Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings) cannot be triggered by the shown code. If there are other source files not provided, those should be scanned for memcmp/strcmp/strncmp uses comparing NUL-terminated strings, but within the supplied code there are no suspicious fragments to report."
