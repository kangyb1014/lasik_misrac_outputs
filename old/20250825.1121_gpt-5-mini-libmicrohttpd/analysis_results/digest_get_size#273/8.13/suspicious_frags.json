  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations/parameters that could be const-qualified. The code contains a single pointer parameter of interest: the function parameter 'struct DigestAlgorithm *da' and its read-only uses (the mhd_assert checks and the comparisons that read da->algo). There are no other pointer variables, pointer members, or pointer-returning functions in the provided snippets. The union/struct members shown are not pointer types, and the mhd_assert macro is defined as ((void)0), so it does not introduce pointer usage. Therefore no other fragments need investigation under Rule 8.13."
