The function digest_get_size takes a non-const pointer parameter 'struct DigestAlgorithm *da' but only reads its members (da->algo, da->uninitialised and da->algo_selected via mhd_assert). There are no modifications to *da in this function, so the pointer could and should be declared as 'const struct DigestAlgorithm *da' to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function digest_get_size:\nstruct DigestAlgorithm\n{\n  /**\n   * A context for the digest algorithm, already initialized to be\n   * useful for @e init, @e update and @e digest.\n   */\n  union DigestCtx ctx;\n\n  /**\n   * The hash calculation algorithm.\n   */\n  enum MHD_DigestBaseAlgo algo;\n\n  /**\n   * Buffer for hex-print of the final digest.\n   */\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n  bool uninitialised; /**< The structure has been not set-up */\n  bool algo_selected; /**< The algorithm has been selected */\n  bool ready_for_hashing; /**< The structure is ready to hash data */\n  bool hashing; /**< Some data has been hashed, but the digest has not finalised yet */\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n}\n...\n#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. The function only reads members of *da (da->algo and the debug members used in the asserts); it does not modify the object. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so the parameter should be declared as const struct DigestAlgorithm *da. The fact that mhd_assert expands to ((void)0) does not affect the rule (the asserted expressions still reference members syntactically), and making the parameter const is safe because converting a non-const pointer to a pointer-to-const is allowed. Therefore agent A's report is correct."
