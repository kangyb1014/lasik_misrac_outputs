  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify the function parameter 'da' (the pointer itself). In digest_get_size the parameter is only dereferenced for reads (da->uninitialised, da->algo_selected, da->algo) and compared; there are no assignments to 'da' (no 'da = ...', no increment/decrement or pointer arithmetic on da). The mhd_assert macro is defined as ((void)0) so it has no effect; even if it were active, its usage dereferences members (reads) only, which is permitted. The #ifdef branches only compare da->algo and return constant sizes; no writes to *da occur. Therefore there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code, and no other fragments need investigation with respect to this rule."
