  "explanation": "No loop constructs (for, while, do-while) are present in this function, so there are no obvious loop controlling expressions to inspect for invariance. The conditional expressions in the if statements (e.g. MHD_DIGEST_BASE_ALGO_MD5 == da->algo, etc.) depend on the runtime value da->algo and therefore are not invariant. The other mhd_assert calls use expressions based on structure members (not compile-time constants) and thus are not invariant. Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #endif) only control compilation of branches and are not loop/controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3. Therefore the only fragment warranting investigation under Rule 14.3 in this function is the literal mhd_assert (0); line."
