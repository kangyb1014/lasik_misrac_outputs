  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function digest_get_size contains no function calls that could form direct or indirect recursion: it only uses mhd_assert (defined here as a no-op macro), conditional checks comparing an enum field to constants, and returns macro-defined constants. There are no calls to digest_get_size itself, no function pointer dereferences, and no other function calls inside this function that might lead to indirect recursion. The inline/attribute macro and the digest-size macros expand to compile-time constructs, not function calls. Therefore Rule 17.2 (no direct or indirect self-calls) is not violated in the provided code."
