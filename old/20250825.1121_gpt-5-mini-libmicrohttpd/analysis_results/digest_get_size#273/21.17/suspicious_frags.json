  "explanation": "No usages of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the supplied function digest_get_size or in the accompanying definitions. digest_get_size only reads an enum field and returns compile-time constant macros (MD5_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE); there are no pointer parameters or buffer operations, and mhd_assert is a no-op macro. The supplied struct and macro definitions do not perform any string handling or memory copying. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not applicable to any fragment shown and no fragments require investigation for out-of-bounds string/memory handling."
