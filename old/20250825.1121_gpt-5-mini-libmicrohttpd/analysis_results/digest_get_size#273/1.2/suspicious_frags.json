  "explanation": "Other parts of the code use standard C constructs and do not contain compiler-specific language extensions that require investigation under MISRA C: preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef/#endif), standard macros for sizes, enum and union types, the mhd_assert macro defined as ((void)0), use of bool inside a debug-only #ifdef, and ordinary control-flow and return statements. No other compiler-specific builtins or extensions such as asm statements, typeof, __builtin_..., #pragma with nonstandard semantics, __packed__, or other __attribute__ usages were found in the provided snippets, so they do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
