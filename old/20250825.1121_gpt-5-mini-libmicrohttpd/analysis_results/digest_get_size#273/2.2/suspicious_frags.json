The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments are not reported because they do not themselves constitute candidate dead code for Rule 2.2: the function signature/_MHD_static_inline annotation is a normal declaration; the surrounding conditional-compilation directives (#ifdef ... #endif) are legitimate feature-gating mechanisms (only the specific if-return branches inside them were flagged); the struct DigestAlgorithm definition (union ctx, enum algo and comments) are data/type definitions and not executable code that could be removed without affecting behaviour; comments and preprocessor directives by themselves are also not dead code. The reported fragments are the executable/conditional statements and the final fallback assert/return which require inspection to determine whether they can actually be executed or are effectively/removeable dead code in the built configuration."
