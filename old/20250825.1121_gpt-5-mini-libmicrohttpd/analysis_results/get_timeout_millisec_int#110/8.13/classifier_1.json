  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be determined from the fragment. The line is a function call, not a pointer declaration; there is no evidence here that a pointer type lacks const qualification. Rule 8.13 would be violated if the parameter 'daemon' (or the parameter type of get_timeout_millisec_) could and should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Daemon *' but is declared non-const. That cannot be established from the single call line, so no violation is reported."
