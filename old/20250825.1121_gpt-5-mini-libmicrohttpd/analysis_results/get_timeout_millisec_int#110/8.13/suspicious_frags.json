  "explanation": "Only pointer usages are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. In the provided function the only pointer occurrences are the parameter declaration and the call that passes that parameter. Other parts of the function (integer types int/int32_t/int64_t, the cast to int, the conditional compilation and numeric bounds checks, and the return statement) do not involve pointer declarations or pointer types and therefore are not relevant to the rule and need not be investigated for const-qualification of pointed-to types."
