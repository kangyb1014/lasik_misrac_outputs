  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required\n\n- get_timeout_millisec_\n  - The target function directly calls this function and returns/uses its result. To determine whether any string.h functions are invoked (and whether they could access out-of-bounds memory), you must inspect the full implementation of get_timeout_millisec_. If it calls string functions or calls other functions that do, those uses must be analyzed.\n\n- MHD_get_timeout64\n  - get_timeout_millisec_ is shown to call MHD_get_timeout64. Any string.h usage in that callee (or further callees) could cause a MISRA string-bounds violation reachable from the target function, so its implementation must be reviewed.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon\n  - The daemon pointer is passed through the call chain. Fields of this structure may be read/written by the callees; if any of those fields are used as buffer pointers/lengths for string.h calls, you must see the struct definition to judge bounds and lifetimes.\n\n- SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_INT64_T\n  - These compile-time macros control the conditional block in get_timeout_millisec_int. Whether the INT_MAX comparison is present affects the code path and whether certain conversions execute; the compiled behavior may change whether different code (possibly inlined callees) gets used or whether additional checks are present.\n\n- INT_MAX\n  - The code compares the 64-bit result against INT_MAX and uses it in the return path. Knowing the exact value is necessary to reason about integer-conversion behavior and whether any subsequent code could use converted values as sizes/lengths for string operations (potentially causing out-of-bounds accesses).\n\n- int32_t, int64_t (and stdint.h)\n  - Precise widths of these types are needed to reason about integer conversion, overflow, and truncation. If converted values are later used as buffer lengths/indices in string.h calls (in callees), those conversions determine safety.\n\n- limits.h\n  - Provides the definition of INT_MAX and related limits; include to resolve macro values used in the conditional.\n\n- any string.h functions referenced in the implementations above (explicit list)\n  - The MISRA rule explicitly concerns the standard string.h functions. If any of these functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear anywhere in get_timeout_millisec_, MHD_get_timeout64, or functions they call, those call sites must be inspected to ensure they do not access out-of-bounds memory. Listing them here tells the next analyst to include/inspect their implementations/usages.\n\nSummary note: The target function itself does not call any string.h functions, so the only way a MISRA string-bounds violation could be reachable from it is via the functions it calls (get_timeout_millisec_ -> MHD_get_timeout64 -> ...). Therefore the implementations of those functions, the MHD_Daemon layout they operate on, and the compile-time macros/types that determine control flow and integer widths are the necessary \"close symbols\" to include for a complete analysis."
