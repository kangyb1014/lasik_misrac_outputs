  "explanation": "To determine whether the controlling expression 'if (! context)' is invariant (MISRA rule) we need information beyond the body of SHA1Reset itself:\n\n- struct SHA1Context (definition): Knowing the type does two things: (1) verifies that the parameter is a plain pointer type and not some special type/alias that could be treated as always non-null by the implementation or annotations, and (2) would reveal any qualifiers (e.g. const, volatile) or unusual typedefs that could affect whether the pointer value can vary at runtime. If the type definition contains attributes or unusual semantics that force a non-NULL pointer, the test could be considered invariant.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value (function implementation / call sites): SHA1Reset is only called from ws_get_accept_value (per the call graph). To judge whether 'context' can be invariant we must inspect all call sites and the expressions/objects passed as the 'context' argument. If ws_get_accept_value always passes a compile-time constant (for example, a literal NULL or an address of a const/static object guaranteed non-NULL), the controlling expression in SHA1Reset could be effectively invariant. The full caller code is required to see what is actually passed and whether it can vary at runtime.\n\n- SHA1Reset (declaration / prototype and any function attributes/annotations): The function declaration may carry attributes (e.g. nonnull, __attribute__((nonnull)), SAL annotations, static analysers' annotations) that assert the parameter must not be NULL. Such annotations would make the check redundant/invariant under the annotated contract and are directly relevant to a MISRA invariant-controls determination. The prototype also shows exact parameter type/qualifiers.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine whether the '!context' test can ever evaluate to a different value at runtime (non-invariant) or is guaranteed constant by the type, annotations, or caller usage (invariant)."
