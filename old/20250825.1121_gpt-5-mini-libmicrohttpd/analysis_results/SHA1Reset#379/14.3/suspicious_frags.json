  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant. The only conditional is \"if (! context)\" which depends on the function parameter context and therefore is not invariant. There are no loops (for, while, do-while) or other constant controlling expressions in this code fragment. The constant assignments to context->intermediate_hash[] and other fields are not controlling expressions and so are not relevant to Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 14.3."
