The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- ws_get_accept_value: direct caller of SHA1Reset. You must inspect its implementation to see whether SHA1Reset is actually invoked at runtime, whether its return value is used, and whether subsequent operations depend on the context state set by SHA1Reset (i.e. to determine if the assignments are observable or removable).\n- SHA1Input: likely operates on the same SHA1Context (updates message length, message block, etc.). Examining SHA1Input shows whether the fields that SHA1Reset writes (length_low/high, message_block_index, intermediate_hash[], computed, corrupted) are later read/used \u2014 essential to decide if the assignments in SHA1Reset affect behaviour.\n- SHA1Result: typically produces the final digest from the SHA1Context (reads intermediate_hash and computed). You need to know whether SHA1Result is ever called after SHA1Reset in the same flow, and whether it depends on the values set by SHA1Reset, to determine whether the initializations are necessary.\n- BASE64Encode: callee of ws_get_accept_value in the same processing chain. Including it is necessary because ws_get_accept_value composes SHA1-based hashing and Base64 encoding to produce an output; the overall observable behaviour (output) may depend on the hash values initialized by SHA1Reset, so the encoder\u2019s usage context influences whether SHA1Reset is needed.\n- ahc_cb: caller of ws_get_accept_value. To prove SHA1Reset is dead you must examine the complete call chain from external entry points to see whether any runtime path reaches and relies on SHA1Reset; ahc_cb is the upstream entry that ultimately triggers the sequence.\n- struct SHA1Context: the definition (fields and types) is required to determine the semantic effect of each assignment in SHA1Reset (which fields are modified, their sizes, whether these writes are initializations or redundant) and whether writes could be overwritten before being read (i.e., whether they are dead).\n- enum SHA1_RESULT: definition of return values (SHA1_RESULT_NULL, SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS) is needed to see how callers react to different return codes (e.g., whether callers ignore the result or take different control flow), which affects whether the function call itself has observable effect or can be removed.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst trace caller/callee interactions, check which context fields are later read, and determine whether the assignments and return value in SHA1Reset are observable (affect program behaviour) or removable (dead code)."
