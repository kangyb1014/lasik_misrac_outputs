  "explanation": "1) struct SHA1Context: The target function only writes into fields of this struct. To determine whether any of those fields are character arrays / null-terminated strings (which would make memcmp-based comparisons relevant), the analyzer must see the exact field types (e.g. whether intermediate_hash is an array of uint32_t vs char[], whether message_block_index is an integer, etc.). This eliminates any ambiguity about whether the function manipulates or exposes C strings that could be compared with memcmp.\n\n2) enum SHA1_RESULT (including SHA1_RESULT_NULL and SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS): SHA1Reset returns these enum constants. The analyzer needs their definitions to confirm they are enum constants (not macros mapping to string operations) and to fully understand the function's observable behavior. Knowing these symbols lets the analyzer focus on whether memcmp is used inside this function (it is not) rather than being hidden through macro/typedef indirection."
