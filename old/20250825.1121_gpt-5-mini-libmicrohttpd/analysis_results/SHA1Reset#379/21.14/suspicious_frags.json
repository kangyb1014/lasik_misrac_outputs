  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The provided SHA1Reset function contains only a null-pointer check (if (! context)), integer field initializations and assignments to the context structure; it does not call memcmp or any other string/comparison library functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp). There are no char buffers or operations that treat data as null-terminated strings. Therefore Rule 21.14 (prohibiting use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) is not applicable to any code in this fragment. If memcmp usage exists elsewhere, it is not present in the supplied code and would need to be reviewed separately."
