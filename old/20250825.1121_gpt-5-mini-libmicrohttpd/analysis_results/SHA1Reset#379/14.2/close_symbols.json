The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct SHA1Context \u2014 The full definition (including types and qualifiers of members length_low, length_high, message_block_index, intermediate_hash[], computed, corrupted) is required to determine whether the assignments in SHA1Reset have any hidden side effects (e.g. members declared volatile, bit-fields, or accessor macros) or whether writing to intermediate_hash performs non-trivial operations. MISRA's for-loop rule refers to side effects and objects modified in the loop body; even though SHA1Reset has no for loop, its member types/qualifiers must be known to conclude it cannot introduce loop-related side-effects when called from a loop.\n\n2) enum SHA1_RESULT (and the specific constants SHA1_RESULT_NULL, SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS) \u2014 The enum definition (or macros) is required to identify the return values used and ensure they are simple constants (no function-like macros or side effects). This helps confirm SHA1Reset itself does not perform any hidden operations that could affect loop-counter rules when it is called inside a for loop.\n\n3) typedefs used by SHA1Context fields (e.g. uint32_t/u_int32_t/unsigned long) \u2014 The underlying type definitions and any associated qualifiers are needed to know the semantics of the assignments (size, signedness, and whether the type is an alias for a type with special behaviour). This ensures the writes in SHA1Reset are plain scalar assignments with no persistent side effects relevant to MISRA loop-clause restrictions.\n\n4) NULL macro \u2014 The definition of NULL (or how pointer null-checks are represented) is useful to confirm the initial null test has no unexpected side effects (e.g. redefined as a function-like macro). While unlikely, any non-standard definition could affect the function's behaviour when called from a for-loop body.\n\nNote: SHA1Reset contains no for loop itself and calls no other functions, so no callee function bodies are required. The symbols above are sufficient to establish whether SHA1Reset could introduce side effects relevant to the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule when invoked inside a for loop."
