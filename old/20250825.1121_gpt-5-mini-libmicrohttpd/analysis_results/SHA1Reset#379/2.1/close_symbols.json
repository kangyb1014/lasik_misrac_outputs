  "explanation": "To determine whether any lines in SHA1Reset are unreachable you must establish whether the function itself can ever be invoked (static functions may be unused) and whether any code paths within it are dead. Specifically:\n\n- ws_get_accept_value (function definition): SHA1Reset has no callees, but the static call graph shows ws_get_accept_value calls SHA1Reset. Inspecting ws_get_accept_value is necessary to see the conditions under which SHA1Reset is called (unconditional, conditional branches that are always false, or within code that is itself unreachable).\n\n- ahc_cb (function definition): ws_get_accept_value is called by ahc_cb in the call graph. If ahc_cb is never invoked or is unreachable, then the call chain to SHA1Reset would be unreachable. You must inspect ahc_cb to see whether it is reachable at runtime.\n\n- callers or registration sites of ahc_cb (places where ahc_cb is invoked/registered): The call graph shows no callers for ahc_cb; to decide reachability you must find where (if anywhere) ahc_cb is invoked or registered (for example, event-loop registration, interrupt vectors, callbacks). If there are no references the chain is dead.\n\n- translation unit / source file containing SHA1Reset: Because SHA1Reset is static (internal linkage), reachability also depends on whether any callers in the same translation unit call it. Confirming the source file and scanning it for callers/conditional compilation is needed.\n\n- preprocessor conditionals / build macros that affect inclusion of SHA1Reset / ws_get_accept_value / ahc_cb: Conditional compilation or build configuration may exclude these functions or make calls conditional; you must check related #if/#ifdef and build flags to know whether the code is actually compiled in (source-level unreachable vs. compiled-out).\n\n- struct SHA1Context (type definition): To verify that all written fields exist and there are no opaque/invalid accesses that could make portions of the code undefined or optimized away; also to validate that the early return (on NULL) is a real control-flow path and not contradicted by annotations.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT and the constants SHA1_RESULT_NULL and SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS: For completeness, inspect these symbols to ensure the return values are real enum constants (not macros that alter control flow) and to confirm there are no unusual attributes affecting reachability.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and the surrounding compilation context) allows a next-step analysis to determine whether SHA1Reset or any portion of it is truly unreachable under the project's build and runtime usage, per the MISRA rule on unreachable code."
