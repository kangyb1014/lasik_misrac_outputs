  "explanation": "- ws_get_accept_value: Direct caller of SHA1Reset. To detect indirect recursion you must inspect the caller\u2019s body to see if it (or functions it calls) can call back into SHA1Reset (forming a cycle).\n- SHA1Input: Callee of ws_get_accept_value. It must be checked because it could call SHA1Reset (directly) or call other functions that lead back to SHA1Reset, creating indirect recursion.\n- SHA1Result: Callee of ws_get_accept_value. Must be inspected for any calls (direct or transitive) that return to SHA1Reset or otherwise form a cycle.\n- BASE64Encode: Callee of ws_get_accept_value. Included for the same reason \u2014 it might (directly or indirectly) call SHA1Reset or functions that eventually do.\n- ahc_cb: Caller of ws_get_accept_value. Included to examine upward call contexts and potential cycles involving higher-level callers (e.g., ahc_cb -> ws_get_accept_value -> ... -> ahc_cb or back to SHA1Reset).\n\nTogether these symbols cover the immediate caller and its callees (and the caller of that caller) so the full reachable call paths that could create a direct or indirect self-call involving SHA1Reset can be analyzed."
