  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided function body. The constructs present are all standard C: a static function, an enum return type, a pointer to a struct parameter, standard if and return statements, logical negation (!), integer hex literals, array indexing and assignments. There are no compiler-specific keywords or syntaxes (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, asm, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, GCC/Clang extensions, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific extensions) in this snippet.\n\nNote: the definitions of enum SHA1_RESULT and struct SHA1Context are not shown here; those declarations should be reviewed separately because they could contain compiler-specific extensions. Based solely on the shown code fragment, nothing needs to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
