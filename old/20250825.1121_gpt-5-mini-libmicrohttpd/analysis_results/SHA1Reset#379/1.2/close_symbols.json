  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the types and symbols it accesses, since extensions are often introduced in declarations. 1) struct SHA1Context (full definition): the function dereferences and writes fields of this struct (length_low/high, message_block_index, intermediate_hash, computed, corrupted). The struct definition may contain compiler-specific extensions (packed/aligned attributes, zero-length arrays, unnamed bit-fields, GCC/Clang __attribute__ annotations, pragmas, etc.) that would violate the MISRA rule. 2) enum SHA1_RESULT (full definition): the function returns values of this enum. The enum declaration could use compiler extensions (non-standard underlying type specifications, attributes) and must be checked. 3) SHA1_RESULT_NULL and SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS (definitions): these identifiers might be enum constants or macros; if they are macros they could expand to extension constructs \u2014 their actual definitions must be examined. 4) declarations/macros/attributes used when defining SHA1Context or SHA1_RESULT: any macros or attribute-like symbols referenced in those definitions (for example PACKED, __attribute__, #pragma directives, compiler-specific macros) must be checked because they are the typical way language extensions are introduced. Inspecting these symbols is sufficient to decide if the target function itself relies on non-standard language extensions."
