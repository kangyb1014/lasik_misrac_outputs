  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer parameters that could be const-qualified. The only pointer in this fragment is the function parameter 'struct SHA1Context *context' and all uses of it are explicit dereferences/assignments. Those lines are reported so they can be checked whether the function must modify the object (which would justify a non-const pointer) or could accept a 'const' pointer instead. No other code in the snippet involves pointer types or pointer usage that is relevant to MISRA C Rule 8.13 (the return type is an enum, the numeric literals and assignments themselves are non-pointer operations). Therefore other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
