  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameter 'struct SHA1Context *context' should be const-qualified we must know whether SHA1Reset modifies the pointed object and whether callers pass writable or const objects. Specifically:\n- struct SHA1Context definition: required to verify which members exist and whether any members are themselves const-qualified; if members are written by SHA1Reset (as in the displayed code) that prevents making the pointer-to-struct const. The exact field types and any const qualifiers are needed for a correct MISRA assessment.\n- typedef / forward declaration for SHA1Context: some code uses a typedef name; include it to ensure the exact type used by callers and declarations is analyzed.\n- ws_get_accept_value (caller) implementation: required to see how SHA1Reset is invoked, what object is passed (an automatic, heap, or const object), and whether callers expect to pass const data. This determines whether changing the parameter to point-to-const would be compatible with call sites.\n- SHA1Reset prototype / declaration in headers: include the public declaration to confirm whether the parameter is already declared with any qualifiers or if other translation units rely on a different signature.\nThese symbols together let the next analyst determine if the pointer could be declared 'const struct SHA1Context *' without breaking semantics or calls, and thus whether the function violates the MISRA guideline."
