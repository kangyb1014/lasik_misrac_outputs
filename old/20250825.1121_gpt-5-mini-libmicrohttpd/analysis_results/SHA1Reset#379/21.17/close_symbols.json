  "explanation": "- struct SHA1Context (full definition): SHA1Reset writes directly into fields of this structure. To prove there are no out-of-bounds accesses (MISRA rule about string.h functions leading to OOB), the exact member types and the size/shape of intermediate_hash (array length and element type) must be known.\n- enum SHA1_RESULT (full definition; values SHA1_RESULT_NULL, SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS): The function returns these enum constants. Confirming they are simple enum constants (not macros expanding to function calls or expressions that might use string.h) is necessary.\n- typedefs for integer types used in SHA1Context (e.g. uint32_t, uint8_t, unsigned int): Member sizes and signedness determine whether the literal assignments are type-correct and do not involve implicit conversions that could hide macro/function behavior. Also confirm these typedefs are not macros that expand to complex expressions.\n- macro/constant that defines intermediate_hash array length (e.g. SHA1_DIGEST_LENGTH or any symbol used to size intermediate_hash): The code indexes intermediate_hash[0..4]; you must verify the declared array length is at least 5 so these writes are in-bounds.\n- any macros or inline accessors that might redefine/expand the field names used (length_low, length_high, message_block_index, intermediate_hash, computed, corrupted): Ensure these member names are not macro aliases that expand to expressions or function calls (which could invoke string.h functions). This rules out hidden use of string functions via macros.\n\nRationale summary: SHA1Reset itself does not call any string.h functions, so the MISRA rule will only be implicated if any of the referenced symbols (struct layout, types, or macros) expand to or rely on string-handling calls or cause out-of-bounds writes. Providing the above symbols lets the analyzer confirm the assignments are simple, in-bounds stores and that none of the return constants or member names are macros that hide string.h usage."
