  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU / HAVE_PTHREAD_SET_NAME_NP_FREEBSD / HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD:\n  These preprocessor macros select which code branch is compiled. To know the actual controlling expressions present in the compiled function (and whether any are invariant) you must know which of these macros is defined so you can examine the active branch only.\n\n- named_thread_starter:\n  This function is the caller (per the call graph). To determine whether the controlling expression if (NULL == thread_name) can be invariant at runtime you must inspect call sites (named_thread_starter) to see what argument is passed for thread_name (e.g. always NULL or a compile-time constant), which would make the controlling expression effectively invariant.\n\n- pthread_setname_np / pthread_set_name_np:\n  These identifiers may be functions or macros. If they are macros that expand to compile-time constants or invariant expressions, then expressions like return ! pthread_setname_np(...); (or the FreeBSD branch's constant return) could become constant/invariant after preprocessing/expansion. Knowing whether they are macros or real library functions (and their observable compile-time form) is needed to determine if any controlling expression becomes invariant.\n\n- NULL:\n  The meaning/definition of NULL (macro) is required to understand the comparison in if (NULL == thread_name). Knowing whether NULL is a compile-time constant (as usual) helps classify the comparison and reason about possible invariance when combined with the actual arguments passed at call sites."
