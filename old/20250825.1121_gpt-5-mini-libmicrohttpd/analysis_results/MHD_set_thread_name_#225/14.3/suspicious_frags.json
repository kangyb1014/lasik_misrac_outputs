  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions (loop conditions, switch controls, or do/while conditions) that are invariant in the supplied code. Specific points:\n- The only if statements (if (NULL == thread_name) and if (NULL == data)) have non\u2011invariant runtime expressions (they depend on parameters/arguments) and therefore do not violate Rule 14.3.\n- There are no for/while/do\u2011while loops or switch statements in the provided snippets, so there are no loop/switch controlling expressions to inspect for invariance.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)) are compile\u2011time directives and not C language controlling expressions covered by Rule 14.3.\n- Constant return expressions (e.g. \"return ! 0;\" or \"return (MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_) 0;\") are not controlling expressions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 14.3 (which concerns loop/switch control expressions).\nGiven the above, there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in the provided code."
