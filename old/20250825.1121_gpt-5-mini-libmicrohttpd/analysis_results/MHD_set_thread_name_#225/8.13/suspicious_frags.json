  "explanation": "The following parts of the code were inspected and do not need further investigation for Rule 8.13: the MHD_set_thread_name_ function parameter thread_name is already const-qualified; calls to pthread_setname_np in the various #ifdef branches accept (or are documented to accept) const char * on the target platforms; the typedef MHD_thread_ID_native_ is not a pointer type; and the thread starter receives a void *data buffer which is later freed (free(data)), so that buffer cannot be made const. The only locations that require investigation are uses of the unnamed helper-parameter structure fields (the cast to the struct pointer and subsequent accesses to param->name, param->arg and param->start_routine and the call via thr_func) because the struct definition is not provided here and those pointer fields might need const qualification (or the cast might be discarding const) \u2014 these fragments are therefore reported for further review."
