There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is needed for MISRA C 'for-loop well-formed' analysis of MHD_set_thread_name_:\n\n- HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU / HAVE_PTHREAD_SET_NAME_NP_FREEBSD / HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD\n  - These build-time macros determine which call-path is compiled. To examine the actual compiled function body (and therefore see whether any for-loops exist or whether expressions with side-effects are introduced in loop clauses), you must know which macro is defined.\n\n- pthread_setname_np (GNU variant)\n  - Prototype/semantics (typically int pthread_setname_np(pthread_t, const char *)) and whether it has side-effects matter if this function call ever appears inside a for-loop clause or body. The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of functions called from a for-loop body as part of the loop body. Even though MHD_set_thread_name_ has no for-loop, its calls must be known in case of future refactoring or macro changes that could place them into loop clauses.\n\n- pthread_set_name_np (FreeBSD/OpenBSD variant)\n  - This variant returns void and is used under a different macro. Knowing its signature/behaviour is required for the same reasons as above (to determine side-effects and whether expressions using it would violate the restrictions on loop clauses).\n\n- pthread_setname_np (NetBSD/OSF1 variant)\n  - NetBSD/OSF1 signature uses three arguments; the semantics and return type (usually int) affect how the expression in the function (e.g., the negation '! pthread_setname_np(...)') behaves and whether that expression could introduce side-effects forbidden in loop clauses.\n\n- MHD_thread_ID_native_\n  - The typedef/underlying type of thread_id (commonly pthread_t) is required to know whether passing thread_id to the setname functions could cause hidden modifications or aliasing concerns relevant to loop-counter/loop-body analysis. Also required to resolve which pthread prototype applies.\n\n- pthread_t\n  - If MHD_thread_ID_native_ is a typedef for pthread_t, the pthread_t definition helps confirm compatibility with the pthread_setname_np signatures and whether any semantics (e.g., being a structure or pointer) could affect side-effect analysis.\n\n- NULL\n  - Used in the function (NULL == thread_name). Knowing the definition of NULL ensures this expression has no unexpected side-effects and does not interact with loop-counter rules.\n\n- named_thread_starter (caller)\n  - Optional but useful: as the caller of MHD_set_thread_name_, named_thread_starter should be inspected if you want to check whether MHD_set_thread_name_ is ever invoked from inside a for-loop body elsewhere. The MISRA rule counts the behaviour of functions called within a for-loop body, so understanding callers can be helpful to assess system-level compliance (though it is not needed to check for-loops located inside MHD_set_thread_name_ itself).\n\nNote: MHD_set_thread_name_ as given contains no for statements. The above symbols are the minimal additional symbols needed to (1) determine which conditional branch is active at compile time and (2) inspect the external function calls that appear in those branches for side-effects that would matter if they were used inside loop clauses or bodies."
