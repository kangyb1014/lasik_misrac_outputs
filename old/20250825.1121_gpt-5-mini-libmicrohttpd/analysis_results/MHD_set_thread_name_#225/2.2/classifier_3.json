  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_set_thread_name_:\n```c\nstatic int\nMHD_set_thread_name_ (const MHD_thread_ID_native_ thread_id,\n                      const char *thread_name)\n{\n  if (NULL == thread_name)\n    return 0;\n\n#if defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU)\n  return ! pthread_setname_np (thread_id, thread_name);\n#elif defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SET_NAME_NP_FREEBSD)\n  /* FreeBSD and OpenBSD use different function name and void return type */\n  pthread_set_name_np (thread_id, thread_name);\n  return ! 0;\n#elif defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD)\n  /* NetBSD use 3 arguments: second argument is string in printf-like format,\n   *                         third argument is a single argument for printf();\n   * OSF1 use 3 arguments too, but last one always must be zero (NULL).\n   * MHD doesn't use '%' in thread names, so both form are used in same way.\n   */\n  return ! pthread_setname_np (thread_id, thread_name, 0);\n#endif /* HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_set_thread_name_:\nstatic MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_ MHD_THRD_CALL_SPEC_\nnamed_thread_starter (void *data)\n{\n  struct MHD_named_helper_param_ *const param =\n    (struct MHD_named_helper_param_ *) data;\n  void *arg;\n  MHD_THREAD_START_ROUTINE_ thr_func;\n\n  if (NULL == data)\n    return (MHD_THRD_RTRN_TYPE_) 0;\n\n  MHD_set_cur_thread_name_ (param->name);\n\n  arg = param->arg;\n  thr_func = param->start_routine;\n  free (data);\n\n  return thr_func (arg);\n}\n...\n#define HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU 1\n...\ntypedef pthread_t MHD_thread_ID_native_\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic int\nMHD_set_thread_name_ (const MHD_thread_ID_native_ thread_id,\n                      const char *thread_name)\n{\n  if (NULL == thread_name)\n    return 0;\n\n#if defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU)\n  return ! pthread_setname_np (thread_id, thread_name);\n#elif defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SET_NAME_NP_FREEBSD)\n  /* FreeBSD and OpenBSD use different function name and void return type */\n  pthread_set_name_np (thread_id, thread_name);\n  return ! 0;\n#elif defined(HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD)\n  /* NetBSD use 3 arguments: second argument is string in printf-like format,\n   *                         third argument is a single argument for printf();\n   * OSF1 use 3 arguments too, but last one always must be zero (NULL).\n   * MHD doesn't use '%' in thread names, so both form are used in same way.\n   */\n  return ! pthread_setname_np (thread_id, thread_name, 0);\n#endif /* HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD */\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the given build: the project defines HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU so only the first #if branch is compiled. The function performs the NULL check and then calls pthread_setname_np; there is no operation that is executed but could be removed without changing behaviour. (Note: code excluded by the preprocessor is not executed and therefore not \"dead code\" at runtime. A separate issue: if none of the HAVE_PTHREAD... macros were defined the function would fall off without a return \u2014 undefined behaviour \u2014 but that is not a Rule 2.2 dead-code violation in the shown build.)"
