  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided code. The function only performs a NULL check on thread_name and then calls platform-specific pthread_setname_np variants; these are not functions from <string.h> and any internal implementation they may have is outside the scope of this source-level check. There are no explicit buffer copies, length computations, or uses of pointer arithmetic on character buffers in the shown code or in the provided related definitions, so no fragments need further investigation for Rule 21.17."
