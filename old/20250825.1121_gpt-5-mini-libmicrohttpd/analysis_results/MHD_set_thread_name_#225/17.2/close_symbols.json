  "explanation": "- named_thread_starter: The static call graph shows named_thread_starter is a caller of MHD_set_thread_name_. To determine whether MHD_set_thread_name_ is (indirectly) recursive you must inspect named_thread_starter\u2019s body and its transitive callees to see if any path leads back to MHD_set_thread_name_. Therefore the full definition of named_thread_starter (and any functions it calls) is required.  \n- pthread_setname_np: This symbol appears in the GNU and NetBSD variants called from MHD_set_thread_name_. Although these are external library functions and normally do not call back into user code, you should consider them (or their stubs/headers) to rule out the unlikely possibility that they invoke application callbacks that could reach MHD_set_thread_name_.  \n- pthread_set_name_np: This FreeBSD/OpenBSD variant is also invoked from MHD_set_thread_name_. As above, include it to confirm it cannot call back into application code and create indirect recursion.  \nNote: To complete the MISRA recursion check you will need the bodies (or reliable stubs) of named_thread_starter and any functions it calls transitively. The pthread_* functions are typically treated as library leaves, but include their declarations/stubs to demonstrate they do not call back into the application."
