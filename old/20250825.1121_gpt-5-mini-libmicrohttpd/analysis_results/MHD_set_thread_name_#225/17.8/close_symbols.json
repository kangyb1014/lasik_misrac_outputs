  "explanation": "- MHD_thread_ID_native_: The exact typedef/definition is needed to know whether thread_id is a scalar, an integer type, or a pointer type. MISRA rule concerns modification of the parameter variable itself; knowing the type helps determine whether any usage or macro expansion could modify the parameter rather than the pointee.\n\n- pthread_setname_np (GNU prototype): The declaration/signature used on GNU systems is needed to verify how thread_name and thread_id are passed (types and constness) and whether the identifier pthread_setname_np might be a macro that could perform assignments to its arguments when expanded. This ensures the call does not imply modification of the function parameters within MHD_set_thread_name_.\n\n- pthread_set_name_np (FreeBSD prototype): FreeBSD uses a differently named function with void return; its prototype is required to check argument types and whether any macro or inline wrapper could modify the parameters (or require casts that change them).\n\n- pthread_setname_np (NetBSD/OSF1 prototype - 3-arg): NetBSD/OSF1 prototypes differ (three arguments). The exact prototype is required to check how thread_name is passed and whether the call site (with 0 as third arg) or any macro wrapper could modify the MHD_set_thread_name_ parameters.\n\n- HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU / HAVE_PTHREAD_SET_NAME_NP_FREEBSD / HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD: The conditional compilation macros determine which branch of the function is actually compiled. To decide if the function ever modifies its parameters in any build configuration, the analyzer must know which of these macros are defined in the build and therefore which callees/prototypes apply.\n\n- any macro definition that maps pthread_setname_np/pthread_set_name_np to something else: On some platforms these names may be macros that expand to inline code or to wrappers that could modify arguments; the macro body is necessary to ensure no assignment to the parameters occurs in the expansion.\n\n- NULL: The definition of NULL is needed to be certain the comparison \"NULL == thread_name\" is a pointer comparison and does not involve some odd macro that could modify thread_name (e.g., a pathological NULL macro). This is a simple sanity symbol so the comparison can be interpreted correctly.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether any code path or macro expansion inside MHD_set_thread_name_ reassigns or otherwise modifies the parameter variables (thread_id, thread_name), which is what the MISRA rule forbids."
