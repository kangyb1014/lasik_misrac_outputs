The preprocessor will select the first #if branch and exclude the FreeBSD branch entirely, so the code fragment shown cannot be part of any compiled translation unit in this configuration and is therefore unreachable.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_set_thread_name_:\n#define HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU 1\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The FreeBSD #elif branch is excluded by the preprocessor when HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU is #defined, but code that is not included by preprocessing is not \"unreachable code\" in the MISRA sense \u2014 it simply is not part of the translation unit being compiled. MISRA Rule 2.1 targets code that is present in the compiled translation unit but cannot be executed at run time (for example, statements after an unconditional return), not alternative branches that are omitted by conditional compilation. Also, the provided project macro definition means the compiled function contains a returning branch (the GNU case), so there is no unreachable code in the compiled unit. Therefore the claim of a Rule 2.1 violation is incorrect."
