  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related definitions for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any code that compares null-terminated strings with memcmp. There are no calls to memcmp, nor are there any manual byte-wise comparisons of C strings in the snippet. The only string-related operation is passing the const char *thread_name to pthread_setname_np variants, and the only check is a pointer NULL check (if (NULL == thread_name)), which is not a memcmp-based string comparison. The provided additional definitions do not introduce memcmp either. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
