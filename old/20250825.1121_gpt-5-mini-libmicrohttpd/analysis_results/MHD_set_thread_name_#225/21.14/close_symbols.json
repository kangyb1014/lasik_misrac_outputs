  "explanation": "- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets use of the standard memcmp function to compare null-terminated strings. Confirming whether memcmp appears (directly or via macros/inline wrappers) in this translation unit or in any macro expansion used by the function is the primary check.\n- pthread_setname_np: One branch calls pthread_setname_np (two- and three-argument variants). These identifiers could be macros or inline wrappers in some environments; include them to verify they do not expand to or call memcmp on null-terminated strings in this translation unit.\n- pthread_set_name_np: The FreeBSD/OpenBSD variant called in another branch. Likewise include it to check for any macro/inline definition that might use memcmp.\n- HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_GNU / HAVE_PTHREAD_SET_NAME_NP_FREEBSD / HAVE_PTHREAD_SETNAME_NP_NETBSD: The preprocessor feature-test macros determine which branch of code is compiled. The analyzer must know which of these are/aren't defined to know which function calls/macros to inspect for memcmp usage.\n- thread_name: The parameter whose type and usage (const char *) must be considered to decide whether any memcmp usage would be comparing a null-terminated string. Include the symbol to confirm it is a C string and to check any local uses of it for memcmp comparisons.\n\nNote: The target function contains no explicit call to memcmp. The listed symbols are sufficient to verify there is no direct or macro-expanded use of memcmp in the active branch of this function."
