  "explanation": "I found no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Analysis of each pointer shows either it is already const-qualified or it must remain non-const because the function (or called routines) modify the pointed-to object or the pointer is used to produce an output:\n\n- method, rnd, saddr, uri, first_header, realm are declared const pointers in the signature and used only for reading; they satisfy Rule 8.13.\n- saddr is cast to (const struct sockaddr_in *) / (const struct sockaddr_in6 *) before accessing members, so no const is being removed.\n- h (in the for loop) is declared as const struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *h and is only read.\n- timestamp is a local array that is written to (so cannot be const) and then passed to functions for hashing/hex output.\n- mthd_for_hash is a local value whose address is taken to pass its bytes to the digest routines; it is a transient mutable object used to form the hash input \u2014 making it const would prevent assigning the chosen value.\n- da (struct DigestAlgorithm *da) is a non-const pointer but it is used with digest_update, digest_calc_hash and related operations that modify the digest context/algorithm state (see the DigestAlgorithm structure and the mhd_assert(! da->hashing) usage). Therefore da cannot and should not be const.\n- nonce (char *nonce) is an output buffer written by MHD_bin_to_hex; it must be non-const.\n\nNo cast in the function strips const qualifiers on incoming const pointers or otherwise introduces non-const pointers where const would be appropriate. For these reasons there are no code fragments here that violate Rule 8.13 or that look suspicious with respect to making pointer targets const whenever possible."
