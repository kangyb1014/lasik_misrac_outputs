First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements (their three clauses and loop counter usage). In the provided function and related macros there are no for statements to inspect: \n- The body of MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ contains only assertions, a call to MHD_calloc_, assignments to struct members, a macro call, and a return. There is no occurrence of the keyword \"for\" or any loop construct in the function body.\n- The supplied related macros/definitions (mhd_assert, MHD_calloc_, _MHD_insert_header_last) do not contain any for statements; _MHD_insert_header_last uses a do { ... } while (0) wrapper, which is a while loop but not a for loop and therefore outside the scope of Rule 14.2.\nBecause Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for loops and there are none present in the given code fragments (including the provided macro definitions), there are no code fragments here that need investigation for compliance with Rule 14.2."
