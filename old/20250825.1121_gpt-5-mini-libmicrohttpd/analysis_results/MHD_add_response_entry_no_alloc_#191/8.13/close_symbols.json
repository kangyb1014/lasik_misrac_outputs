  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if the pointers should be const-qualified:\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (definition): Needed to see the exact types of the fields header and value (are they declared as char * or const char *?), and to discover any other fields or invariants. Also required to find every place in the codebase that directly accesses those fields (reads vs. writes). Without the struct definition you cannot determine if the stored pointers are ever modified through the struct, which is the core question for MISRA pointer constness.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition): Required to understand how headers are stored/owned inside the response (linked list, vector, ownership semantics). If the response implementation copies the strings, takes ownership, or later mutates the stored pointers, that affects whether the original pointers (function parameters) can be const.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (definition): Included because it is stored in the header struct; although not directly about pointer constness, the meaning of the kind field can imply whether the value/header are treated as mutable (e.g. kinds that mean 'mutable buffer' vs 'literal string'), which influences whether the pointers must be non-const.\n\n- MHD_calloc_ (prototype / implementation): Needed to confirm allocation semantics and whether it returns memory that the code expects to write into. While MHD_calloc_ here only allocates the container struct, understanding allocation/free conventions in the codebase helps determine ownership and whether the pointed-to data is expected to be modifiable.\n\n- _MHD_insert_header_last (prototype / implementation): Crucial to know what insertion does with hdr and its fields \u2014 whether it stores the pointer as-is, makes a copy of header/value, modifies them, or later mutates them. If this function copies the strings or treats them as immutable, the parameters could be const; if it stores them for later mutation, they must remain non-const.\n\n- All functions that read, write, assign or free MHD_HTTP_Res_Header::header or ::value (e.g. header setters, removers, destroy/free routines): To determine whether the pointers can be const you must find every code site that writes through these pointers or reassigns those struct fields. Any function that writes into *hdr->header or *hdr->value, or frees and reuses those pointers, demonstrates they cannot be const. Conversely, if all usages are read-only and ownership is documented as immutable, then the parameters (and stored fields) could be const-qualified.\n\nIn short: to assess the MISRA rule you must know the struct layouts and every codepath that mutates or takes ownership of the header/value pointers. The listed symbols provide those definitions and the functions whose behavior determines whether const qualification is permissible."
