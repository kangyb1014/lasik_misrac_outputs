  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 8.13: the 'response' parameter and the local 'hdr' object are modified (headers are inserted and fields assigned), so their pointers must remain writable and cannot be const; allocations and assignments to header_size/value_size/kind involve non-pointer or mutable data and are not candidates for adding const; assertions and the calloc/check/return logic do not involve pointer-to-object const-qualification. Therefore only the places where external char* pointers are accepted and stored should be examined for possible const qualification."
