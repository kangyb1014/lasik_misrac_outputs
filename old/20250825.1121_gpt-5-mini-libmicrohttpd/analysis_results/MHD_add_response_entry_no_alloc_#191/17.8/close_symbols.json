  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (a function parameter shall not be modified) you must inspect any symbols that could cause the parameter variables in this function to be changed (including macro expansions that inject code into the function) or that change the meaning of the assignments in the function body:\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: needed to see the exact types of hdr->header and hdr->value (pointer vs array, const qualifiers). If those members are arrays or have types that make the assignments illegal or that imply modifying the parameter objects rather than copying the pointer value, that affects the MISRA analysis.\n\n- _MHD_insert_header_last: this is invoked with the parameter 'response'. If it is a macro (or inline function) it could expand to code that reassigns or modifies the local parameter variable 'response' inside this function. You must inspect its definition to ensure no assignment to the parameter variables occurs as a result of the call/macro expansion.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: required to understand how _MHD_insert_header_last uses the response object (and to detect any macros that might access or rebind the 'response' token). Also useful to determine whether modifications are to the object pointed to (allowed) versus the parameter variable itself (forbidden).\n\n- MHD_calloc_: inspect whether this is a macro (or function) and whether it expands to any code that could modify parameters of the enclosing function (e.g. via macro side effects). If it is a plain allocator function, it will not modify parameters, but the definition must be checked.\n\n- mhd_assert: often a macro; its expansion may reference tokens from the caller scope and could (in pathological cases) modify parameters. Confirm its definition has no side effect that modifies any of this function's parameters.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: include to confirm that 'kind' is not a pointer/alias type and to rule out any unexpected macro definitions that could change its nature; also to inspect any macros that may reference 'kind' during expansion.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their declarations and any macro definitions/expansions) is sufficient to determine whether this function body or any injected macro code reassigns or otherwise modifies the function parameters (the pointer variables themselves), which is what the MISRA rule prohibits."
