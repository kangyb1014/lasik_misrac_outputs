  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. With mhd_assert defined as ((void)0) the calls mhd_assert(0 != header_len); and mhd_assert(0 != content_len); expand to a no\u2011op expression statement ((void)0);. Those statements are executed but have no effect, and removing them would not change the program behaviour as built\u2014so they meet the definition of dead code in MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2. (If the project were built with a different definition of mhd_assert that performs checks, the situation would differ; Rule 2.2 applies to the project as actually configured.)"
