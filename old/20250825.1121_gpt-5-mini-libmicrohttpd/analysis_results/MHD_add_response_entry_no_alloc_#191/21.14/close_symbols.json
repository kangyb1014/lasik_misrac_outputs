  "explanation": "- _MHD_insert_header_last: The target function calls this routine; any use of memcmp to compare header or value strings (or wrappers around memcmp) is likely to appear here. To determine whether a null-terminated string is compared via memcmp you must inspect this function and its callees.\\n- MHD_calloc_: Although not directly related to memcmp, this allocation function is used to create the MHD_HTTP_Res_Header instance. Knowing its behaviour (returned memory contents, alignment, possible wrappers) helps rule out hidden comparisons or special-case logic in allocation-time helpers.\\n- mhd_assert: The macro/function used in the target enforces header_len/content_len non-zero; its expansion could contain code that performs checks or comparisons (possibly calling utility routines). Check its definition to ensure it does not invoke memcmp on the header/value.\\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: The struct fields (header, header_size, value, value_size, kind) tell whether the code treats header/value as length-known buffers or null-terminated strings. MISRA rule violation depends on whether memcmp is used on null-terminated strings; the field semantics are essential.\\n- struct MHD_Response: The response structure determines how headers are stored/iterated by _MHD_insert_header_last; that iteration code might perform comparisons using memcmp.\\n- memcmp: The standard library symbol itself must be located in the codebase (direct uses or wrapped calls). To prove absence/presence of the MISRA violation you must find all occurrences of memcmp (or thin wrappers) in _MHD_insert_header_last and its reachable callees.\\nNote: After inspecting the above symbols, also expand the analysis to any direct callees of _MHD_insert_header_last (and their callees) to find any uses of memcmp or wrapper functions that compare strings."
