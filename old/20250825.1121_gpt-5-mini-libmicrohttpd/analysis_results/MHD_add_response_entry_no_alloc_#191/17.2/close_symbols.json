  "explanation": "Include the bodies (or precise static call-graph entries) for the listed functions because they are directly invoked by MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_. To determine whether the target function violates the MISRA recursion rule you must know whether any of these functions (directly or indirectly) call MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (i.e. produce a cycle).\n\nWhy each symbol is required:\n- mhd_assert: Called immediately at function start. An assertion helper can call logging, error handlers, or cleanup code (abort/exit or project-specific handlers) that might indirectly call into higher-level API functions. You must examine mhd_assert and any functions it calls to see if a path leads back to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_.\n- MHD_calloc_: Allocator wrapper called to allocate an MHD_HTTP_Res_Header. Custom allocation wrappers often call project-specific memory-management functions which could call back into response/HTTP helpers. Inspect MHD_calloc_ and its transitive callees (e.g., malloc/calloc, custom allocators, tracking hooks) to ensure no indirect call to the target.\n- _MHD_insert_header_last: This is the most likely source of indirect recursion because it manipulates the response and headers and may call other response/header-management functions (possibly the function that created headers). You must inspect its implementation and all functions it calls (transitive callees) to verify there is no path back to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_.\n\nNote: For a complete recursion check you must obtain the transitive callee set for each of the above symbols (i.e., all functions they call, and functions those call, etc.) and verify that none of those functions is MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_. The struct and enum types used by the target are not required to detect recursion, but the full implementations/call-graphs of the three functions above (and their transitive callees) are required."
