  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for detecting unreachable code:\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - mhd_assert is invoked twice at the start of the function. Its definition determines whether it is a no-op (e.g. compiled out under NDEBUG), a simple runtime check that returns to the caller on failure, or a check that calls abort/exit/longjmp (i.e. does not return). Any non-returning behavior or side-effecting behavior could make subsequent statements unreachable in some builds; conversely, being a no-op affects whether those checks participate in reachability reasoning.\n\n- NDEBUG\n  - The common pattern for assert-like macros depends on NDEBUG. To determine whether mhd_assert is active or compiled out in the current build (thus affecting reachability), the value/definition of NDEBUG (or the project configuration that controls mhd_assert) must be known.\n\n- MHD_calloc_\n  - The allocation wrapper is used in the conditional \"if (NULL == (hdr = MHD_calloc_(...))) return false;\". If MHD_calloc_ can legally return NULL, the return false branch is reachable; if MHD_calloc_ is implemented to abort on allocation failure (or is annotated as non-returning on failure), that branch is unreachable. Also function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((noreturn))) or documented semantics are required to decide reachability of the NULL-check and the code that follows.\n\n- _MHD_insert_header_last\n  - This function is called just before the final \"return true;\". If _MHD_insert_header_last is annotated or implemented as non-returning (calls exit/longjmp/abort), the final return true would be unreachable. Its prototype/definition and attributes are required to determine whether the code after the call can ever execute.\n\n(These symbols provide the control-flow/semantic information needed to decide whether any branch or statement in MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ can never be reached under the project's build/configuration.)"
