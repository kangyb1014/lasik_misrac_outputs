  "explanation": "No calls to <string.h> functions appear in the shown function or in the provided macros, so there are no direct uses of memcpy/strcpy/etc. to inspect here. The only operations that could later lead to out-of-bounds accesses by string functions are the acceptance and storage of the caller-supplied pointers and their lengths (the fragments listed above). Other fragments in the code (the calloc macro, the allocation of hdr, and the _MHD_insert_header_last macro) do not themselves invoke or perform buffer accesses via the standard string handling functions and therefore do not need investigation under MISRA C Rule 21.17 in the context of this function."
