  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA <string.h> analysis:\n\n- MHD_calloc_: Needed to know allocation behavior and failure semantics. If this allocator returns memory that is later reused, or has different alignment/size behavior, it could affect whether subsequent string.h operations on header/value overflow. Also confirms whether hdr is a shallow container only.\n\n- _MHD_insert_header_last: This function determines what happens to the hdr structure and its header/value pointers after insertion. It may copy the header/value buffers into other storage, duplicate pointers, modify lengths, or perform string operations (memcpy/strcpy) that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. To determine compliance you must inspect this routine for any string.h usage and how it uses header_size/value_size.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header (definition): The exact member types, names, and any alignment/padding matter (e.g. whether header_size/value_size are size_t and how they are interpreted). Also needed to find any helper macros or inline functions that operate on these members and might call string.h functions.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition): The response object likely owns the header list or provides context used by insertion/transmit code. Understanding its layout and ownership rules is necessary to trace how header/value buffers are used and whether they are copied or referenced, and whether any string operations are later performed on them.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (definition): Although not directly a string operation, the kind may change how header/value are interpreted (e.g. some kinds may be treated as NUL-terminated strings and be passed to strlen/strcpy). Knowing the kinds is required to know which consumers will treat the buffers as strings.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function): The asserts encode preconditions (here header_len != 0 and content_len != 0). You must inspect whether these are active in production builds and whether other preconditions exist; they affect whether callers can legally pass non-terminated buffers that are later used with string functions.\n\n- All functions that read, copy or transmit MHD_HTTP_Res_Header.header or MHD_HTTP_Res_Header.value: The MISRA rule applies to any use of standard string functions. Even though the target function does not itself call any <string.h> functions, other code that consumes the hdr->header or hdr->value may. To determine compliance you must examine every function that uses these fields (especially ones that call memcpy, memmove, memset, strlen, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, memcmp, strspn, etc.) to ensure they respect the provided header_len/value_len and do not access beyond the provided buffer bounds.\n\nIn short: analyze the allocation and ownership (MHD_calloc_, struct definitions), the insertion/management routine (_MHD_insert_header_last), the value-kind semantics (enum), and every consumer that may invoke <string.h> operations on the stored header/value buffers. These symbols are necessary to conclude whether any string.h call could access beyond the bounds of the referenced objects."
