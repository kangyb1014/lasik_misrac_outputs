  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (Controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The two calls mhd_assert(0 != header_len) and mhd_assert(0 != content_len) contain controlling expressions. The exact definition/expansion of mhd_assert (macro or function) determines whether these become runtime checks, are removed/disabled (e.g. when NDEBUG is set), or are replaced by compile-time/constant behaviour. If mhd_assert expands to nothing or to a compile-time construct, those controlling expressions may be effectively invariant \u2014 so the macro definition is required to decide compliance.\n\n- MHD_calloc_\n  - The if condition uses the result of (hdr = MHD_calloc_(...)) compared to NULL. If MHD_calloc_ is a wrapper that never returns NULL (e.g. it aborts or longjmps on OOM, or is annotated as non-null), then the condition \"NULL == (hdr = ...)\" would be an invariant false controlling expression. Conversely, if it can return NULL at runtime, the condition is non-invariant. The implementation/prototype/behavior of MHD_calloc_ is therefore essential to decide whether the if expression is invariant.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header\n  - The type is used in the sizeof call passed to MHD_calloc_. Knowledge of the struct definition can reveal if any unusual attributes, flexible-array members, or custom allocation behavior are tied to the type (which might affect allocation wrapper behavior or macros). At minimum it establishes the pointer type of hdr and confirms the comparison against NULL is a pointer comparison, which matters for assessing constant/invariant status.\n\n- NULL\n  - The exact definition of NULL (0, ((void*)0), etc.) can affect whether a compare looks like an integer constant expression in some contexts or yields warnings; knowing its definition removes ambiguity when reasoning whether the controlling expression could be evaluated as an invariant by the compiler or static analyser.\n\n- configuration macros used by mhd_assert and MHD_calloc_ (e.g. NDEBUG, any MHD-specific OOM/abort macros)\n  - These compile-time macros can change the expansion/behavior of mhd_assert and MHD_calloc_. For example, NDEBUG may disable asserts; a project-specific macro might change allocation wrapper behaviour to never return NULL. Those macros are necessary to determine whether the controlling expressions are effectively invariant in the build/configuration under analysis.\n\n(Other local symbols in the function such as hdr, header_len, content_len, and kind are parameters/locals whose runtime variability is obvious; the above symbols are the external definitions that could make the controlling expressions effectively invariant.)"
