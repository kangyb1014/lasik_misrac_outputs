  "explanation": "No control statements in the function have invariant controlling expressions. The only conditional is: if (NULL == (hdr = MHD_calloc_ (1, sizeof (struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header)))) which depends on the runtime result of calloc and the assignment to hdr, so it is not invariant. There are no while, for, do-while or switch statements whose controlling expressions are compile-time constants. The mhd_assert invocations (mhd_assert (0 != header_len); mhd_assert (0 != content_len);) expand to ((void)0) per the provided macro definition, so they do not generate controlling expressions and therefore cannot violate Rule 14.3. The MHD_calloc_ macro expands to calloc((n),(s)), so the allocation check is runtime-dependent. Accordingly, there are no fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
