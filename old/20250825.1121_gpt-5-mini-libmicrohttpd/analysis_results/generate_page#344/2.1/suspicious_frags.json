  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are provably unreachable in this function. Reasoning: \n\n- The top-level if (0 != strcmp(url, \"/\")) and its complementary path cover disjoint runtime conditions (url != \"/\" vs url == \"/\"). Each branch contains return statements only for specific runtime conditions; none of the statements within those branches are placed after an unconditional return in the same execution path. Therefore code in each branch is reachable when its branch condition holds.\n\n- The conditional compilation block around MHD_HAVE_LIBMAGIC (the got = read(...); if (0 < got) mime = magic_buffer(...); else mime = NULL;) is valid: when the macro is defined both the if and its else produce reachable code depending on runtime 'got', and when the macro is not defined the preprocessor yields the single assignment mime = NULL; \u2014 there is no leftover unmatched else or unreachable clause introduced by the preprocessor.\n\n- The POST handling (if 0 == strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_POST)) has distinct runtime sub-paths: uc == NULL (initial chunk) returns after allocating and installing uc; non-zero upload_data_size handles streaming chunks and returns; the final zero-size chunk performs cleanup and returns. Each of these is reachable under normal HTTP POST processing and none is rendered unreachable by preceding unconditional returns in the same path.\n\n- The subsequent GET/HEAD check and the final fallback return handle all remaining methods; there is no code after an unconditional return that would be executed in the same path.\n\n- There are no static statements after unconditional returns, no code following an unconditional infinite loop, and no obvious compiler-time constant conditions that would eliminate code (other than the documented #ifdef).\n\nGiven these points, I did not identify any fragments that should be investigated for unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
