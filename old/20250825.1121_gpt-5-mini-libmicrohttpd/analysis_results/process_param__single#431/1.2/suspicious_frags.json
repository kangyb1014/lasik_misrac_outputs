  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. Elements examined and why they do NOT require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2: \n- Function declaration/definition (static, enum return type, parameter list): all standard C constructs, not compiler extensions. \n- Identifier naming (process_param__single): use of double underscore is allowed by some coding rules as implementation-reserved, but it is not a compiler language extension; it is a standard identifier form (note: reserved-identifier issues are outside Rule 1.2 and would be handled by other MISRA rules). \n- const char * and pointer indexing (param_name[1]): standard C. \n- if statements, fprintf calls: standard C library usage, not an extension. \n- Boolean expression and negation (tool_params.single = ! 0;): logical-not of integer constant is pure standard C (results in 1), spacing does not indicate an extension. \n- Ternary operator and character literal comparison (return '-' == param_name[1] ? ...): standard C. \n- No use of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), compound literals with GCC-only semantics, builtin functions, inline assembly, VLAs (variable-length arrays used as extension in some compilers), or other documented vendor-specific language extensions. \nTherefore there are no suspicious code fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
