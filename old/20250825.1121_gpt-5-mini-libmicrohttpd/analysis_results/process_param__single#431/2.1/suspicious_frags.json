  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in this function. Both early returns inside the two if statements are conditional on runtime flags (tool_params.shared and tool_params.unique) and therefore potentially reachable; the remaining assignment and the final return are executed when neither condition holds, so they are reachable as well. There is no code after an unconditional return that would be dead, no mutually-exclusive compile-time constants forcing a branch to be unreachable, and no constructs (e.g. goto into a later block) that create unreachable regions. Note: potential issues such as the unusual expression \"tool_params.single = ! 0;\" or possible out-of-bounds access of param_name[1] (if param_name has length < 2) are not instances of unreachable code and therefore are not reported under Rule 2.1 (they may be relevant to other MISRA rules or runtime safety checks but do not indicate unreachable code)."
