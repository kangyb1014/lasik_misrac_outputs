According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be const-qualified when possible.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. In the function 'de' is only read (de->d_name is examined and passed to snprintf) and never written through, so it can and should be declared as 'const struct dirent *de;'. Assigning the result of readdir (which has type 'struct dirent *') to a 'const struct dirent *' is a permitted qualification conversion (adding const) and does not violate the C type system; the change also matches the uses (e.g. de->d_name will decay to const char * as expected by snprintf). There is no apparent reason in the shown code or surrounding context that would prevent making this pointer-to-const, so the cited MISRA violation is valid."
