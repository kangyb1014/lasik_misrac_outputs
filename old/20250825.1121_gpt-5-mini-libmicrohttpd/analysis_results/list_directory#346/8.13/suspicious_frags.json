  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they already obey const-qualification requirements or must remain non-const for valid reasons: - The parameter dirname is already const-qualified (const char *dirname). - rdc is a pointer to a mutable context whose members (rdc->buf and rdc->off) are modified; rdc and rdc->buf therefore must not be pointers-to-const. - fullname is a local char array which is written into; it cannot be const. - DIR *dir and the use of readdir/closedir require non-const DIR pointers per the API. - The temporary allocator result is stored in void *r and assigned into rdc->buf; that buffer is written, so it must be a mutable char*. These cases either already use const where appropriate or legitimately require non-const pointers, so they are not flagged for further investigation under Rule 8.13."
