  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about adding const where possible you must know the exact types and prototypes used by list_directory so you can tell which pointers could/should be const:\n\n- struct ResponseDataContext: to see the exact member types and whether members are pointer types that could be const (the function uses rdc extensively).\n- ResponseDataContext.buf: to know its declared type (char * vs void * vs const char *) so you can decide if it should be const-qualified or not (it is written to via snprintf/realloc).\n- ResponseDataContext.buf_len: to confirm its integer type (size_t or other) used in bounds checks and arithmetic affecting pointer use.\n- ResponseDataContext.off: to confirm its type (size_t or other) used for indexing into buf.\n- PATH_MAX: to confirm array length/type for fullname and whether buffer sizing influences pointer usage.\n- struct dirent: to know the type returned by readdir and whether its fields are modifiable or const.\n- struct dirent.d_name: to know if d_name is an array (char[]) or a pointer (char *), which affects whether passing it to functions that take const char * would require/allow const qualification.\n- opendir: prototype (returns DIR *) and constness of its arguments to see if dirname should be const (it already is) and how dirname is used.\n- readdir: prototype/return type (struct dirent *) to determine whether the returned pointer is const-qualified by the platform/library or must remain non-const.\n- closedir / DIR: to confirm DIR typedef/prototypes (not directly const-related but part of the signatures used).\n- struct stat: to know types of fields (st_mode) and whether stat expects const char * for path argument.\n- stat: prototype (int stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf)) to confirm constness expected for the first argument and how fullname (char []) is passed.\n- S_ISREG: macro definition (uses st_mode) to ensure no pointer-const issues there.\n- snprintf: prototype (int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...)) to check which parameters are const-qualified (format is const char *, %s arguments are expected as const char *) and whether passed arguments (fullname, de->d_name) match/should be const.\n- realloc: prototype (void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)) to know whether buf must be non-const (realloc takes non-const pointer) and thus cannot be const-qualified if reallocated.\n- MHD_Result / MHD_YES / MHD_NO: enum/values used in returns; include to check if any pointer-to-const rules apply to these types (mostly for completeness of symbol set).\n- size_t: to confirm the integer type used for lengths/indices and how it interacts with pointer constness decisions.\n\nWith these definitions/prototypes the next analyzer can determine where pointers are read-only (and so could be const) or written/returned/reallocated (so must be non-const), and thus judge compliance with the MISRA rule."
