  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the function de is only read (de->d_name is inspected and used in snprintf) and never modified, so per MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be to a const-qualified type when possible. It is safe here to change the declaration to const struct dirent *de (assigning the result of readdir(), which returns struct dirent *, to a pointer-to-const is allowed), or to introduce a const char *name = de->d_name and use name thereafter. If later code needed to modify the dirent object or pass it to APIs requiring a non-const pointer, that would justify leaving it non-const, but in the presented snippet the pointer can and should be const-qualified."
