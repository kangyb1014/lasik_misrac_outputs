In the fragment de is declared as 'struct dirent *de' and de->d_name is only used for reading (passed to snprintf). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be const-qualified (e.g. 'const struct dirent *de' or using 'const char *' for the name) whenever possible. fullname is a mutable buffer (written to earlier) so it need not be const, but de (and its d_name) can be const \u2014 the current code therefore violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function list_directory:\nstruct ResponseDataContext\n{\n  /**\n   * Response data string.\n   */\n  char *buf;\n\n  /**\n   * Number of bytes allocated for 'buf'.\n   */\n  size_t buf_len;\n\n  /**\n   * Current position where we append to 'buf'.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In the function de is only used for reading (de->d_name and de->d_name[0]) and is never used to modify the dirent object, so it can and should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. \"const struct dirent *de\"). Assigning the result of readdir (which returns struct dirent *) to a const-qualified pointer is allowed without a cast, so making this change is safe in this code path. (If elsewhere the pointer is used to modify the object or passed to APIs that require a non-const pointer, those uses would prevent making it const.)"
