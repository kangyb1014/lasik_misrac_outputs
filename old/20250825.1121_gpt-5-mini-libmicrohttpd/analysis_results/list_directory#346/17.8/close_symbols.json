  "explanation": "- struct ResponseDataContext: needed to confirm which identifiers in the code are fields of the object pointed to by the parameter rdc (e.g. buf, buf_len, off). MISRA allows modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter but forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself; knowing the exact fields proves assignments like rdc->buf = r are member updates, not pointer reassignment.\n- opendir: inspect its prototype to verify it takes a const char * by value (so calling opendir(dirname) cannot modify the dirname parameter itself).\n- readdir: its prototype shows it takes DIR * and returns struct dirent *; needed to verify it does not take/modify dirname or rdc.\n- closedir: prototype confirms it accepts DIR * and cannot modify the function parameters of list_directory.\n- struct dirent: required to verify access to de->d_name is a read from the returned dirent structure and does not modify the dirname parameter.\n- stat: prototype shows it takes const char * and struct stat * by value/pointer; required to ensure calling stat(fullname, &sbuf) cannot modify the dirname or rdc pointer variables.\n- struct stat: needed to interpret S_ISREG(st_mode) and confirm stat usage has no side-effect on list_directory parameters.\n- S_ISREG: required to confirm it is a test macro/function with no side-effects that might modify parameters.\n- snprintf: prototype is needed to ensure passing dirname and fullname as arguments does not allow modification of the dirname parameter (snprintf writes into provided buffer only).\n- realloc: prototype and semantics are needed because rdc->buf is reassigned from realloc; we must check this is a field assignment on *rdc (permitted) and that realloc does not modify the rdc pointer itself.\n- PATH_MAX: to understand fullname array sizing and whether any operations implicitly modify parameters due to buffer overflows (helps reason about whether dirname might be overwritten).\n- DIR: type definition to ensure uses of DIR* (dir) do not alias or modify function parameters.\n- NULL: used in comparisons; include to ensure checks like (NULL == (dir = opendir(dirname))) do not imply modifying the dirname parameter.\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_NO, MHD_YES: include for completeness to interpret return values; not directly related to parameter modification but useful to fully understand function behavior.\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyst confirm whether any statement in list_directory performs an assignment to the parameter variables (rdc or dirname) themselves or relies on callees/macros that could modify those parameter variables; they also show that all modifications are to the object pointed to by rdc (allowed by MISRA) or are side-effect-free with respect to the parameters."
