  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies a function parameter itself. The parameters are: (1) struct ResponseDataContext *rdc \u2014 only dereferenced to modify members (rdc->buf_len, rdc->buf, rdc->off), which is allowed because the rule permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter; there is no assignment to the parameter variable rdc (no statement like rdc = ...). (2) const char *dirname \u2014 declared const and only read (passed to opendir, used in snprintf), so it is not modified. All other assignments (e.g. rdc->buf = r after realloc, rdc->off += ...) operate on the object pointed to by rdc, not on the pointer parameter itself. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
