  "explanation": "For determining unreachable code in list_directory you must know any external types, values and library semantics that can make branches impossible or always taken. Briefly:\n\n- struct ResponseDataContext: needed to see the exact field types and any invariants placed on the object by callers (whether fields can be NULL, initial values, etc.). Unreachability of the resize branch or writes depends on these fields.\n- rdc->off (type and invariants): the conditional rdc->off + 1024 > rdc->buf_len and the arithmetic updating rdc->off determine whether the resize branch or subsequent buffer usage is possible; need the type (signed/unsigned) and caller guarantees.\n- rdc->buf_len (type and invariants): the overflow check (2 * rdc->buf_len + 1024) < rdc->buf_len and the realloc size depend on the exact type and allowed ranges for buf_len.\n- rdc->buf (type): to know whether writing &rdc->buf[rdc->off] is valid and whether realloc semantics can make code unreachable.\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO): to understand the function return values and whether certain return paths are meaningful/used by callers.\n- PATH_MAX: determines size of fullname and whether the snprintf size check can ever be false/true.\n- struct dirent (layout, d_name): to know that de->d_name[0] access is valid and whether d_name can be empty; required to decide reachability of the dot-skip branch.\n- opendir / readdir / closedir: their return behavior (NULL vs non-NULL, errno semantics) determines whether the loop/body and the final closedir call are reachable.\n- struct stat (st_mode) and S_ISREG macro: needed to know whether the check for regular file can be true/false in practice and whether S_ISREG can be a compile-time constant for given platform (affecting reachability of the skip branch).\n- stat: its return semantics (when it fails) determine reachability of the branch that continues on stat failure.\n- snprintf (prototype and return semantics): the code relies on snprintf returning the required/actual length or negative on error; to know if the size-check branches (too long, snprintf error, buffer-too-small) are reachable you must know the exact return behavior on the target platform/implementation.\n- realloc (prototype and semantics): to determine whether the out-of-memory branch (NULL == realloc) is possible and whether the resize code path is reachable.\n- size_t and SIZE_MAX (width and wrap-around behavior): the overflow check for (2 * buf_len + 1024) < buf_len depends on unsigned wrap-around characteristics and the width of size_t; needed to decide if that branch can ever be taken.\n\nProviding these symbols (types, macros, and function semantics) allows a precise analysis of each conditional and loop in list_directory and therefore whether any statements are statically or practically unreachable under the project's target environment and caller contracts."
