  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are likely to hide unreachable-code issues or that contain logic/comments suggesting the author thought the branch should not normally be reached. These fragments involve size calculations, casts, overflow checks and snprintf return-value handling \u2014 all places where expressions/types/overflows can make branches always-true or always-false (hence unreachable), or mask undefined behaviour that results in unreachable code. Other parts of the function (opendir check and early return, the readdir loop, the dot-file skip, the stat()/S_ISREG() checks, closedir and final return) are standard control-flow/error-handling constructs and are reachable under normal operation; they do not exhibit the same signs (casts/overflow-prone arithmetic or surprising assumptions) that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Thus they do not need to be reported as suspicious for unreachable-code analysis."
