  "explanation": "Each symbol is required to decide whether any controlling expression in list_directory is invariant under the MISRA rule:\n\n- struct ResponseDataContext\n  - Needed to know the exact types of rdc->buf, rdc->buf_len and rdc->off and any invariants implied by their declarations (e.g. if buf_len or off are fixed constants, or if off cannot change). Several controlling expressions use these fields (rdc->off + 1024 > rdc->buf_len, (2 * rdc->buf_len + 1024) < rdc->buf_len, rdc->buf_len - rdc->off <= (size_t) res) so their types and ranges are essential to determine whether those tests can ever evaluate differently.\n\n- rdc->buf_len (type/width) and rdc->off (type/width)\n  - Explicitly call out the need for the precise integer types and widths because the code performs arithmetic and comparisons (including subtraction and multiplication) that can wrap or be subject to unsigned semantics; whether expressions can be invariant depends on these widths/limits.\n\n- PATH_MAX\n  - Defines sizeof(fullname). The test sizeof(fullname) <= (unsigned int) snprintf(...) depends on PATH_MAX and thus must be known to determine if that comparison can ever be true/false.\n\n- snprintf (prototype and return semantics)\n  - The controlling expression compares snprintf's return value to sizeof(fullname) (after casting to unsigned int) and later checks res for <= 0 and compares (size_t) res to available buffer space. Correct analysis requires snprintf's return rules (return value when truncated, negative on error) and its type (int) to decide if those tests can change at runtime or are effectively constant.\n\n- unsigned int width / UINT_MAX and size_t width / SIZE_MAX\n  - The code casts snprintf's int return to unsigned int and mixes size_t and unsigned int in comparisons. Whether the cast/truncation or unsigned wrap can make an expression invariant (or conversely allow it to vary) depends on integer widths/limits (UINT_MAX, SIZE_MAX). These limits are required to reason about overflow, truncation, and the efficacy of the overflow-detection test (2 * buf_len + 1024) < buf_len.\n\n- struct dirent (member d_name) and readdir()\n  - The loop condition while (NULL != (de = readdir(dir))) and the test '.' == de->d_name[0] depend on readdir() behavior and the contents/layout of struct dirent (type/length of d_name). To determine whether the loop or the '.' test are invariant, we must know if readdir can return varying entries and how d_name is represented.\n\n- opendir(), closedir(), DIR\n  - The opening and closing of the directory affect whether readdir will ever return non-NULL; opendir failure is tested at the start. Knowing their semantics (including failure modes) is necessary to rule out invariant conditions such as a never-successful opendir or a dir that never yields entries.\n\n- stat(), struct stat, and S_ISREG macro\n  - The code tests stat(fullname, &sbuf) and then S_ISREG(sbuf.st_mode). Whether those tests can vary depends on stat() semantics and the meaning of S_ISREG for the platform (how st_mode is defined). To determine if the S_ISREG check is invariant, we need these definitions.\n\n- realloc()\n  - The realloc call is inside a conditional that checks for NULL return. Whether that check can be invariant (always false/true) depends on realloc semantics and the environment; include it to reason about the break path and whether the loop's later behavior is affected.\n\nThese symbols provide the typing, value ranges, and ABI/semantic behavior necessary to decide if any of the controlling expressions in list_directory are constant (invariant) or can legitimately vary at runtime, and thus whether the MISRA C rule is violated."
