  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. In particular:\n- No GCC/Clang-specific identifiers or constructs are present (no __attribute__, __builtin_..., __extension__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, label-as-value, or other documented compiler extensions).\n- All language constructs are standard C (enums, structs, function definitions, casts, sizeof, snprintf, realloc, etc.).\n- Use of POSIX APIs and macros (opendir, readdir, closedir, struct dirent, stat, S_ISREG, PATH_MAX, DIR) are OS/library interfaces, not compiler language extensions; they should be reviewed for portability but are not MISRA Rule 1.2 compiler-extension violations per the instruction.\n- The cast to (unsigned int), the array declaration char fullname[PATH_MAX], and the numeric/size_t comparisons are standard C usage, not extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need to be flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If you want a portability or POSIX-API compliance review instead, tell me and I will flag relevant fragments."
