  "explanation": "I found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code. The only string-related operations are: (1) a single-character comparison ('.' == de->d_name[0]) which checks only the first character, not a full null-terminated string comparison; (2) formatting/copying via snprintf into fullname and rdc->buf; and (3) passing strings to stat and to the HTML output. None of these use memcmp (or an equivalent byte-wise comparison) to compare null-terminated strings, so there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 to report."
