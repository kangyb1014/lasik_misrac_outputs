  "explanation": "For deciding whether list_directory violates the MISRA rule prohibiting use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must be able to see any places where memcmp could be used (directly or indirectly) and whether the code operates on NUL\u2011terminated strings. Each listed symbol is required as follows:\n\n- struct ResponseDataContext: its members buf, off and buf_len determine how buffers and offsets are used. Knowing buf's type (char *) and whether any accessor macros exist is needed to see if comparisons against these buffers might involve memcmp or null-terminated strings.\n\n- struct dirent (d_name): de->d_name is passed to snprintf(\"%s\"). You must confirm d_name is a NUL\u2011terminated C string (its declaration/semantics) because the MISRA rule applies to use of memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings; also to ensure the code is not implicitly relying on non\u2011terminated byte arrays.\n\n- PATH_MAX: size of fullname buffer; needed to reason about buffer sizing and whether any alternative comparisons or truncations (that might use memcmp) are present elsewhere.\n\n- S_ISREG macro: used to check file type. Expand/definition must be inspected to ensure it is not implemented via any hidden string/comparison helper that uses memcmp (very unlikely but required to be thorough).\n\n- opendir / readdir / closedir declarations (and any local wrappers): readdir provides struct dirent; any local overrides/wrappers could call memcmp internally, so you must inspect their definitions to rule out hidden memcmp usage.\n\n- stat declaration and struct stat: same rationale as S_ISREG \u2014 ensure no wrapper or macro hides memcmp usage; also to understand st_mode semantics.\n\n- snprintf declaration/definition or any local wrapper named snprintf: snprintf is used with \"%s\" and passes fullname and de->d_name. If snprintf were a project wrapper (macro/function) that internally used memcmp to process strings, that would be a violation; check real definition.\n\n- realloc declaration/definition or any local wrapper named realloc: realloc is used to grow rdc->buf; a project-specific realloc could hide memcmp usage \u2014 include to check for indirect memcmp calls.\n\n- memcmp declaration/definition: obviously needed to detect any direct or indirect use in the same translation unit or in any callee/wrapper visible from this function.\n\nIn short, include the definitions/declarations of the data structures and all called functions/macros (and any project-local wrappers of standard functions) so you can (a) search for any memcmp usage reachable from list_directory and (b) determine whether the code manipulates NUL\u2011terminated strings that could have been compared with memcmp."
