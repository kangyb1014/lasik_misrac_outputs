  "explanation": "No other calls to functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function, so there are no additional direct string.h uses to investigate. Other operations (opendir, readdir, stat, S_ISREG, realloc, closedir, integer arithmetic and bounds checks around rdc->buf) are not string.h functions; the simple access de->d_name[0] is only a single-byte read used for skipping dot-entries and does not itself involve library string-handling APIs. Therefore the two snprintf invocations above are the relevant fragments to inspect for potential out-of-bounds string handling or improper use of buffer sizes."
