  "explanation": "I have selected fragments that are suspicious with respect to possible dead code or logic errors that could mask dead operations: the fullname snprintf check uses an explicit cast to unsigned int and compares it to sizeof(fullname) (size_t) which is a type/width mismatch and could hide a no-op path or an always-false/always-true branch; the buffer-resize block contains an overflow-detection condition ((2 * rdc->buf_len + 1024) < rdc->buf_len) that in normal runs will never be true (i.e. it is only taken on integer wrap-around) and thus the surrounding code might be effectively dead for typical inputs; the final footer memcpy appears to write the footer into rdc.buf (start of buffer) rather than appending at rdc.off \u2014 this is likely a logic bug that should be investigated (it results in overwriting earlier data and may make some code paths ineffective). Other fragments were not marked because they are defensive checks or essential operations that clearly affect program behaviour and therefore are not dead code: e.g. the opendir/readdir/closedir sequence, stat() checks, S_ISREG filtering, the various snprintf result checks, bounds checks (rdc->buf_len - rdc->off <= (size_t) res), the realloc failure handling, and the early returns \u2014 all of these actively influence control flow or resource management and their removal would change program behaviour, so they are not considered dead code and do not need investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
