The fragments listed above are all controlling expressions in this function and therefore should be investigated to ensure they are not invariant. The remaining lines in the function are not controlling expressions (they are plain function calls, return statements or structural tokens) and thus cannot violate Rule 14.3: check_param_port(); check_apply_param__all_cpus(); check_apply_param__threads(); check_param__empty_tiny_medium_large(); check_param__shared_single_unique(); the return statements and block delimiters are not controlling expressions and do not need investigation for this rule."
