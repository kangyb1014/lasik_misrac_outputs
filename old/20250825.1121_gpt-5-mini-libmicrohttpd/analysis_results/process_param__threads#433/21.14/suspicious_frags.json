  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided code for process_param__threads and the related get_param_value. There are no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp (nor strcmp/strncmp) in the shown code. String handling is done via pointer checks and indexing (e.g., param_tail[0], value_str[digits]) and single-character comparisons (e.g., '!=' and '==') that do not invoke memcmp or perform a memcmp-style comparison of null-terminated strings. The only external helper called here is mhd_tool_str_to_uint, but its implementation is not provided; since it is not present in the supplied fragments, it cannot be flagged here. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If you want, I can also inspect the implementation of mhd_tool_str_to_uint or search other files for memcmp usage."
