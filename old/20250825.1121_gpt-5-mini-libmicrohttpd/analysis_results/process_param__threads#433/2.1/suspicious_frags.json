  "explanation": "No syntactically or semantically unreachable code fragments are present in the provided function. Every return statement is guarded by a conditional that depends on runtime state (tool_params flags, the result of get_param_value, or the parsed param_value), so none of the statements after those conditionals is provably unreachable from the source shown. There are no statements after an unconditional return, no dead-case switch labels, no infinite loops terminating with code that can never be reached, and no constants or macros in this snippet that would make a branch always false at compile time. Any potential unreachability would depend on external context (for example, if tool_params.all_cpus or tool_params.thread_per_conn are compile-time constants or if get_param_value is known to always return a specific value), which is not visible here; such context should be checked separately, but within this fragment there are no obvious unreachable-code violations to investigate."
