  "explanation": "For determining whether any statements in process_param__threads are dead (can never affect program behaviour) the analyzer needs the following additional symbols and why:\n\n- tool_params\n  - The global variable read and written in this function. Knowing its declaration alone is insufficient; you must know all writes and the possible run-time values to determine whether the two guarded branches (tool_params.all_cpus and tool_params.thread_per_conn) can ever be true or false.\n\n- struct/type of tool_params (definition and global initializer)\n  - The type and any static initializer determine default values. If the members are initialized to values that make the tests always false/true, code may be dead. The initializer also affects whether some assignments are merely redundant initializations.\n\n- process_param__all_cpus\n  - This likely sets tool_params.all_cpus. To know if the first fprintf/return path can ever be reached you must know whether and how this symbol can set that flag before process_param__threads is called.\n\n- process_param__thread_per_conn\n  - This likely sets tool_params.thread_per_conn. Same rationale: if that flag can be set earlier, the second fprintf/return path may be reachable; otherwise it might be dead.\n\n- process_short_param and process_long_param\n  - These are the direct callers of process_param__threads. You must inspect call sites to determine under what call contexts process_param__threads is invoked and whether preceding logic makes some branches impossible.\n\n- process_short_params_str and process_params\n  - These are callers of the caller functions; they provide the overall call-chain (e.g., command-line parsing) and ordering of option handling which affects whether flags in tool_params can be set before process_param__threads runs.\n\n- get_param_value\n  - This function produces value_res and param_value used by subsequent logic. If get_param_value can always return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR or can never return it (or has side effects), that affects reachability of later code (the zero-check, the assignment tool_params.threads = param_value, and the final return).\n\n- mhd_tool_str_to_uint\n  - get_param_value calls it (per call graph). Its behaviour (range checks, side-effects, when it fails) influences whether get_param_value will ever succeed and therefore whether code after the get_param_value call is reachable.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result and PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR\n  - Needed to interpret get_param_value results and the equality test (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR == value_res). If the enum has values or semantics that imply a constant result, code could be unreachable.\n\n- fprintf and stderr\n  - The function performs I/O calls as side-effects. For dead-code analysis, calls that only produce diagnostic output are still observable behaviour; knowing whether fprintf is compiled out/wrapped or has no effect (e.g., in some embedded builds) is necessary to decide if those statements are removable without changing program behaviour.\n\nTogether these symbols provide the data- and control-flow context (how tool_params can be set, how get_param_value behaves, and calling contexts) needed to determine whether any branch or statement in process_param__threads is truly dead code under the whole program semantics."
