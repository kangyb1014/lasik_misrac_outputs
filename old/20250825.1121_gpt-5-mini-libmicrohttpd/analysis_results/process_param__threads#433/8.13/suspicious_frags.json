  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. All pointer parameters in this function are already const-qualified (const char *param_name, const char *param_tail, const char *next_param), so they comply with the rule. The only other pointer use is the address-of operator (&param_value) passed to get_param_value; that points to a non-const unsigned int because get_param_value is expected to write an output value, so it should not be const. fprintf uses the existing const char * arguments and string literals (which are effectively const), so no additional pointer should be const-qualified. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require further investigation under Rule 8.13."
