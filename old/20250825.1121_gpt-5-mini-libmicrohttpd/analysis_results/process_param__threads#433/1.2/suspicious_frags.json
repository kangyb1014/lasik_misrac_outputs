  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: static function scope, enum type, const char* parameters, unsigned int, standard library I/O (fprintf, stderr), and ordinary comparisons and returns. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __typeof__, inline assembler, _Pragma with implementation-specific pragmas, or other documented compiler extensions. The double underscore in the function name (process_param__threads) is a naming convention and may be an issue for other MISRA rules (reserved identifiers), but it is not a compiler language extension per the Rule 1.2 criterion, so it is not reported here."
