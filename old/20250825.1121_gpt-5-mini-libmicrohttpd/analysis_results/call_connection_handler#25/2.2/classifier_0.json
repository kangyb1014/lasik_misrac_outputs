  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of call_connection_handler:\n```c\nstatic void\ncall_connection_handler (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;\n  size_t processed;\n\n  if (NULL != connection->rp.response)\n    return;                     /* already queued a response */\n  processed = 0;\n  connection->rq.client_aware = true;\n  connection->in_access_handler = true;\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      daemon->default_handler (daemon->default_handler_cls,\n                               connection,\n                               connection->rq.url,\n                               connection->rq.method,\n                               connection->rq.version,\n                               NULL,\n                               &processed,\n                               &connection->rq.client_context))\n  {\n    connection->in_access_handler = false;\n    /* serious internal error, close connection */\n    CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (connection,\n                            _ (\"Application reported internal error, \" \\\n                               \"closing connection.\"));\n    return;\n  }\n  connection->in_access_handler = false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function call_connection_handler:\nstatic void\nsend_redirect_fixed_rq_target (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  char *b;\n  size_t fixed_uri_len;\n  size_t i;\n  size_t o;\n  char *hdr_name;\n  size_t hdr_name_len;\n\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state);\n  mhd_assert (0 != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri);\n  mhd_assert (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri <= \\\n              c->rq.req_target_len);\n  fixed_uri_len = c->rq.req_target_len\n                  + 2 * c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri;\n  if ( (fixed_uri_len + 200 > c->daemon->pool_size) ||\n       (fixed_uri_len > MHD_MAX_FIXED_URI_LEN) ||\n       (NULL == (b = malloc (fixed_uri_len + 1))) )\n  {\n    connection_close_error (c,\n                            _ (\"The request has whitespace character is \" \\\n                               \"in the URI and the URI is too large to \" \\\n                               \"send automatic redirect to fixed URI.\\n\"));\n    return;\n  }\n  i = 0;\n  o = 0;\n\n  do\n  {\n    const char chr = c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt[i++];\n\n    mhd_assert ('\\r' != chr); /* Replaced during request line parsing */\n    mhd_assert ('\\n' != chr); /* Rejected during request line parsing */\n    mhd_assert (0 != chr); /* Rejected during request line parsing */\n    switch (chr)\n    {\n    case ' ':\n      b[o++] = '%';\n      b[o++] = '2';\n      b[o++] = '0';\n      break;\n    case '\\t':\n      b[o++] = '%';\n      b[o++] = '0';\n      b[o++] = '9';\n      break;\n    case 0x0B:   /* VT (vertical tab) */\n      b[o++] = '%';\n      b[o++] = '0';\n      b[o++] = 'B';\n      break;\n    case 0x0C:   /* FF (form feed) */\n      b[o++] = '%';\n      b[o++] = '0';\n      b[o++] = 'C';\n      break;\n    default:\n      b[o++] = chr;\n      break;\n    }\n  } while (i < c->rq.req_target_len);\n  mhd_assert (fixed_uri_len == o);\n  b[o] = 0; /* Zero-terminate the result */\n\n  hdr_name_len = MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION);\n  hdr_name = malloc (hdr_name_len + 1);\n  if (NULL != hdr_name)\n  {\n    memcpy (hdr_name,\n            MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION,\n            hdr_name_len + 1);\n    /* hdr_name and b are free()d within this call */\n    transmit_error_response_header (c,\n                                    MHD_HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY,\n                                    RQ_TARGET_INVALID_CHAR,\n                                    hdr_name,\n                                    hdr_name_len,\n                                    b,\n                                    o);\n    return;\n  }\n  free (b);\n  connection_close_error (c,\n                          _ (\"The request has whitespace character is in the \" \\\n                             \"URI.\\n\"));\n  return;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nconnection->in_access_handler = false;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment connection->in_access_handler = false; is executed on the normal return path from daemon->default_handler. Earlier in the function connection->in_access_handler is set to true before calling the handler, and the error branch also resets it to false before returning. Removing the final assignment would leave connection->in_access_handler true after a successful handler return, changing program behaviour. Therefore this statement is not dead code and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
