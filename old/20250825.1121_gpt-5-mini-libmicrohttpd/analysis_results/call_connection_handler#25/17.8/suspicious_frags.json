  "explanation": "No fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The rule forbids modifying a function parameter itself (for pointer parameters, assigning to the pointer variable), but allows modifying the object the pointer refers to. In call_connection_handler the parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *connection'. The code does not reassign 'connection' (no statements like 'connection = ...' or similar). All mutations are to members of the object pointed to by connection (e.g. connection->rq.client_aware = true; connection->in_access_handler = true/false; connection->rp.response is tested; &connection->rq.client_context is passed to a callee). These are permitted under the rule. The local variable 'daemon' is initialized from connection->daemon and subsequently used; modifying local variables is not covered by Rule 17.8. The call to daemon->default_handler passes the pointer to the connection and addresses of fields, but there is no evidence in this snippet that the function parameter itself is being modified here. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
