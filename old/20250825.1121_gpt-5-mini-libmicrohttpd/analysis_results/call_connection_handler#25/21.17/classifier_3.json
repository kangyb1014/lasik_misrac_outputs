  "scenario": "The call site itself does not invoke any functions from <string.h>; it merely passes pointers (connection->rq.url, method, version) to a handler function pointer. Therefore the fragment does not itself violate Rule 21.17. A possible violation scenario would be inside the implementation of daemon->default_handler \u2014 for example, if default_handler did strcpy(dest, connection->rq.url) where dest is a fixed-size buffer smaller than strlen(connection->rq.url)+1 (or used memcpy/memmove with an incorrect length), this would result in an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access and violate Rule 21.17. From the shown fragment alone no violation can be confirmed."
