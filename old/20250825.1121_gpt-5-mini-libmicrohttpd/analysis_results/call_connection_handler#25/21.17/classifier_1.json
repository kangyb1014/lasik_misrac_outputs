  "scenario": "The expression connection->rq.method itself does not invoke any <string.h> function, so this fragment alone does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A violation could occur elsewhere if the callee (daemon->default_handler) treats connection->rq.method as a C string while the object is not NUL-terminated or is shorter than assumed. For example, if method points to a fixed-size buffer that is not guaranteed to contain a terminating '\\0' and default_handler calls strlen(connection->rq.method) or strcpy(..., connection->rq.method), that call could read beyond the buffer bounds and violate Rule 21.17."
