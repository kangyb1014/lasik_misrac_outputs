  "explanation": "This function snippet contains no direct calls to any <string.h> routines (memcpy, strcpy, strcat, strlen, etc.). The only places that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses via string.h calls are the string pointers passed into the external callback default_handler. Therefore the invocation of daemon->default_handler and the string arguments (connection->rq.url, connection->rq.method, connection->rq.version) must be inspected in the context of that handler to ensure it does not call string.h functions in a way that accesses beyond the bounds of the referenced objects. Other statements in this function (checks on connection->rp.response, setting flags, processed variable, CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR, returns) do not themselves call or pass buffers to string.h functions and so do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 in this snippet."
