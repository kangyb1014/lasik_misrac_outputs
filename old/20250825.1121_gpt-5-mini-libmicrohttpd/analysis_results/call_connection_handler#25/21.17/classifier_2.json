  "scenario": "This code fragment (accessing connection->rq.version) does not itself call any <string.h> functions, so by itself it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A violation could occur in a realistic scenario if the pointer stored in connection->rq.version is invalid or not a properly terminated character string and the called default_handler (or code it calls) uses <string.h> functions on it. For example, if connection->rq.version points to a non-null-terminated buffer or to memory beyond its allocated bounds and default_handler calls strlen(connection->rq.version) or strcpy/strncpy/strcat/etc., those library calls could read or write past the object bounds and thus violate Rule 21.17."
