  "scenario": "The fragment itself only passes connection->rq.url to the default handler; it does not call any <string.h> functions. Therefore the shown code does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A concrete violation scenario would be if the default_handler (or any callee) uses a string function unsafely \u2014 for example: it calls strcpy(buf, connection->rq.url) where buf is a fixed 64\u2011byte array but connection->rq.url is longer than 63 characters (or not NUL\u2011terminated). That strcpy would read/write beyond the bounds of the referenced objects and thus violate Rule 21.17."
