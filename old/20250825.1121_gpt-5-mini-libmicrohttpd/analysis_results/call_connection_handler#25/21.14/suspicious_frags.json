  "explanation": "No occurrences of the function memcmp (or any call to memcmp) are present in the provided code fragment. The fragment performs pointer checks, sets flags, and calls daemon->default_handler with URL/method strings, but contains no direct string comparisons or uses of memcmp/memcmp-like idioms. Therefore there are no code locations here that should be investigated for Rule 21.14. Note: the call to daemon->default_handler passes string pointers into an external handler; any memcmp usage there is outside this fragment and would need to be inspected in that handler's implementation, not in this snippet."
