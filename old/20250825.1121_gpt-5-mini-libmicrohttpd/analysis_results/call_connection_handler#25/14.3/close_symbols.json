  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (controlling expressions shall not be invariant):\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): The controlling expressions reference members of this struct. You must know the exact member types and any qualifiers (const/volatile/static) to decide whether expressions using them can be considered compile-time invariant.\n\n- connection->rp.response (declaration and type): The first if tests (NULL != connection->rp.response). To determine if that controlling expression could be an invariant you need the declaration and type of rp.response (is it a pointer, an integral constant, a macro-generated constant, or declared const/volatile?). Its storage class/qualifiers affect whether the expression can be considered invariant.\n\n- connection->rq (declaration and member types: url, method, version, client_context, client_aware): The call to daemon->default_handler passes several members of rq; knowing their types and qualifiers is needed to reason whether those values (or the call result) could be constant/invariant or whether evaluating them has side-effects that make the controlling expression non-invariant.\n\n- connection->in_access_handler (declaration and qualifiers): This member is written before and after the handler call. Its declaration/qualifiers (e.g., volatile) could affect whether reads/writes influence invariance reasoning (and whether modifications make the expression non-invariant for subsequent checks in other code paths).\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition): The second controlling expression uses daemon->default_handler. You need the daemon struct to know the declaration of default_handler and default_handler_cls and whether the pointer is mutable or fixed (e.g., const function pointer) which could make the call result effectively invariant.\n\n- daemon->default_handler (declaration/type/signature): The second if compares MHD_NO to the result of calling this pointer. You must know the function-pointer type and return type to determine if the expression is a genuine function call producing a runtime value (not an invariant), or if it could resolve to a constant expression (e.g., macro or inline constant) at compile time.\n\n- daemon->default_handler_cls (declaration/type): Passed to the handler call; knowing its type may be necessary to determine whether the call is actually resolved at compile time or depends on mutable data (affects invariance reasoning).\n\n- MHD_NO (enum/macro and its type): The comparison is explicit against MHD_NO. You need to know whether MHD_NO is a simple compile-time constant of the same type as the handler return, or some aliased macro or expression that could change the interpretation of the controlling expression's variability.\n\n- CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (macro/function): While not directly part of a controlling expression, it appears on the branch taken when the controlling expression is true. Its definition may have side-effects that affect program state relevant to subsequent control flow analysis; include it to fully understand any consequences of the branch used to judge invariance implications.\n\n- _ (translation macro): Present in the argument to CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR. Its expansion could be a macro/function that affects compile-time vs runtime evaluation; include to be certain the string argument or macro does not alter invariance considerations.\n\nNotes: The primary controlling expressions to analyze are (NULL != connection->rp.response) and (MHD_NO == daemon->default_handler(...)). The symbols above let an analyst determine the types, qualifiers, and whether values are compile-time constants or runtime-dependent (and whether the function pointer call is genuinely a runtime call), which is exactly what is needed to decide compliance with the MISRA rule on invariant controlling expressions."
