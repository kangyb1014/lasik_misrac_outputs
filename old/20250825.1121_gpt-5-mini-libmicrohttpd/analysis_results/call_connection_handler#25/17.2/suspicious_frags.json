  "explanation": "Fragments NOT listed do not need investigation for Rule 17.2 because they do not perform calls that could produce direct or indirect recursion into call_connection_handler (they are simple assignments, checks, or internal cleanup). Specifically:\n\n- Simple assignments and flag manipulation in call_connection_handler (processed = 0; connection->rq.client_aware = true; connection->in_access_handler = true/false) are data updates and cannot by themselves cause function calls or recursion.\n\n- The early return when connection->rp.response is non-NULL is a control-flow guard; it contains no calls.\n\n- The call sites listed above cover the places where external callbacks or external function pointers are invoked: daemon->default_handler, CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (which invokes MHD_connection_close_), daemon->notify_completed, and daemon->custom_error_log. These are the only points in the presented code that can invoke externally-supplied code paths and therefore possibly produce indirect recursion. Those have been included in suspicious_frags.\n\n- Calls such as MHD_destroy_response, MHD_pool_destroy, MHD_connection_mark_closed_ are internal cleanup calls visible in the provided code but their bodies were not supplied; absent evidence that they invoke user callbacks or call back into call_connection_handler, they are less likely to create recursion. If their implementations contain callbacks to user code, they should be re-evaluated, but based on the provided fragments the primary recursion risks are the function-pointer invocations already reported.\n\n- Assertion macros and (void) casts (e.g., mhd_assert, (void) emsg) do not call user code and thus do not present recursion risks.\n\nIf additional source for the internal cleanup functions (MHD_destroy_response, MHD_pool_destroy, MHD_connection_mark_closed_) becomes available, they should be examined for callback invocations; otherwise the listed fragments cover all call sites that could lead to indirect recursion from the shown code."
