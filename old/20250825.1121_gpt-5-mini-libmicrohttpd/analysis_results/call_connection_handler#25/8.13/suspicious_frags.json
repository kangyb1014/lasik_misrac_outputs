  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either involve pointers that are intentionally used for mutation/output or do not present pointer-to-object-type qualifications issues: - The function parameter (the connection pointer) is written to (members are modified), so it cannot be made a pointer-to-const. - The local variable 'processed' is passed by address to be updated by the handler, so a non-const pointer is required. - The checks and assignments that set flags on the connection object are explicit modifications, so the pointers involved must be to non-const data. - The NULL literal and the error-reporting macro invocations do not involve pointer-to-object-type qualifications that would be improved by adding const. - The conditional test against an existing response is a read of a mutable field; it is used in context where the object is mutable. Therefore these other fragments are not candidates for promoting pointer targets to const under Rule 8.13."
