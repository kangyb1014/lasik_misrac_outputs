If, on the other hand, rq.url is already declared as a pointer-to-const (const char *), or the string must be modified, then there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct but conditional. From the snippet alone you cannot determine a MISRA 8.13 violation because the rule concerns how pointers are declared throughout the code: a pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type whenever it is not used to modify the pointed object. If connection->rq.url is declared as char * but the code (and the default_handler contract) never modifies the string, then rq.url should be declared const char * and leaving it as char * would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Conversely, if rq.url is already const-qualified, or the string must be modified, there is no violation. To decide definitively you must inspect the declaration of rq.url and the default_handler prototype and their uses."
