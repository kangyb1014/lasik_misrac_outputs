  "scenario": "The member daemon->default_handler_cls is used as a context pointer passed to daemon->default_handler but (as written) is not const-qualified. If default_handler does not modify the object pointed to by default_handler_cls (i.e. it only reads the context), then the pointer type should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (for example const void *default_handler_cls) to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If, however, the handler is documented to mutate the context and the parameter and member are intentionally non-const, then there is no violation."
