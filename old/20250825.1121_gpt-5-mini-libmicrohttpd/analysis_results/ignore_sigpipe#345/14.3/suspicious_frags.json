  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions in constructs such as if, for, while, do-while and switch being invariant (i.e. constant). In the provided code there are no loops or switch statements, and the only controlling construct is the if: if (0 != sigaction (SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig)). This expression is not invariant because it calls sigaction and depends on runtime state and environment. The preprocessor conditional #ifdef SA_INTERRUPT is a compile-time conditional, not a runtime controlling expression covered by Rule 14.3. The catcher function contains no controlling expressions. Therefore there are no suspicious invariant controlling expressions to investigate."
