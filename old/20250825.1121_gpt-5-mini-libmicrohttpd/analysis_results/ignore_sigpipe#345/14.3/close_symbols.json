  "explanation": "- sigaction: The 'if' controlling expression is 0 != sigaction(...). You must see the declaration/definition (or macro) of sigaction and its return semantics to know whether its return value can vary at run time (i.e. not an invariant). Also needed to check if sigaction is actually a macro that could expand to a constant.\\n- SIGPIPE: The signal number passed to sigaction; if SIGPIPE were defined in an unusual way that made the call invariant (e.g. replaced by a compile-time stub), that would matter.\\n- struct sigaction: The type and its fields (sa_handler, sa_mask, sa_flags) must be known to ensure the code is doing ordinary runtime initialization and that nothing in those members makes the call/invocation invariant.\\n- sigemptyset: Its prototype/definition is needed to confirm it has no surprising compile-time semantics that could make the overall behavior invariant.\\n- SA_INTERRUPT and SA_RESTART: These macros are used in the #ifdef and in assignments to sa_flags; their presence/absence changes the compiled code path. Although the MISRA rule concerns runtime controlling expressions, the preprocessor selection affects which code is analyzed and must be known.\\n- catcher: The signal handler function (pointer) assigned to sa_handler; knowing whether this is a constant or macro could affect static analysis of invariance.\\n- strerror and errno: errno is used in the diagnostic and sigaction may set errno on failure; strerror/errno are required to understand error semantics and whether errno usage indicates a possible varying return from sigaction.\\n- fprintf and stderr: Included to complete the error-reporting call chain so an analyzer can see that the if-body is reachable at run time (i.e. that sigaction can fail and make the controlling expression non-invariant)."
