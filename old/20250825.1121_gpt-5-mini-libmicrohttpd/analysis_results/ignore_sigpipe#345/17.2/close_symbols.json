  "explanation": "To decide whether ignore_sigpipe participates in a direct or indirect recursion (MISRA: a function shall not call itself directly or indirectly) you must know all possible call edges that start from or reach ignore_sigpipe. The listed symbols are needed for that analysis:\n\n- catcher: The signal handler installed into sig.sa_handler. If catcher (or any function it calls) can call ignore_sigpipe (directly or via other functions), that creates an indirect recursion. You must inspect catcher\u2019s definition and its call graph.\n- sigaction: The system/library function used to install the handler. Verify that its implementation does not call back into application code that could reach ignore_sigpipe (usually it does not, but include for completeness).\n- sigemptyset: Library function called here; include to confirm it does not invoke user callbacks that could cause recursion.\n- fprintf: Library I/O function called on error; include to confirm it will not call back into user code (usually does not).\n- strerror: Library function used to render errno; include to confirm it will not call user functions that could lead back to ignore_sigpipe.\n- stderr: The FILE* stream used by fprintf. Included to check any custom stream hooks in the build that might call application code.\n- errno: The global error indicator used by strerror; included to trace any custom errno handling that might call application code.\n- SIGPIPE: Signal constant being handled. Needed to confirm which signal\u2019s handler is installed (relevant when analyzing catcher behavior and signal delivery semantics).\n- SA_INTERRUPT / SA_RESTART: Flags used when installing the handler. They affect signal semantics and whether interrupted system calls are restarted; relevant for reasoning about when catcher might run and whether that could lead to calling ignore_sigpipe.\n- main: Listed as a caller of ignore_sigpipe in the static call graph. To detect indirect recursion you must examine main\u2019s call graph (and the call graphs of functions main calls) to see if any path from catcher or other callee functions could reach back to main and then to ignore_sigpipe, forming a cycle.\n\nPractically, the critical symbol is catcher and the complete call graph of catcher (and recursively the call graphs of any functions catcher calls). The other listed library and macro symbols are included to ensure there are no unexpected callback edges from library/system code that could close a cycle back to ignore_sigpipe."
