  "explanation": "No function parameters are present in ignore_sigpipe \u2014 the function has no formal parameters. All assignments (e.g. sig.sa_handler = &catcher;) modify members of local automatic objects (sig, oldsig), not function parameters. Calls that take pointers (sigemptyset(&sig.sa_mask); sigaction(SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig)) pass addresses of local objects; modifying the objects pointed-to by pointer parameters is explicitly allowed by Rule 17.8, and the code only relies on that. Library calls (sigemptyset, sigaction, fprintf, strerror) are invoked with values or pointers to locals; none of the local code modifies any incoming function parameter (there are none). Therefore there are no fragments in this code that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
