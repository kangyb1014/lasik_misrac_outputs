  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided fragment. The code uses standard C constructs (static function, struct objects, pointer-to-function assignment via &catcher) and POSIX/OS APIs/macros (struct sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaction, SIGPIPE, SA_INTERRUPT/SA_RESTART). These are platform or library interfaces, not compiler language extensions such as GCC/Clang __attribute__, asm, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords. The conditional use of SA_INTERRUPT is a platform-specific macro, not a compiler language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that meet the Rule 1.2 criterion of using documented compiler language extensions."
