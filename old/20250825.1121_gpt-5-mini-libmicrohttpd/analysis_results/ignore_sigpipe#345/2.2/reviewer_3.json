  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement \u201c(void) sig;\u201d is an explicit no-op used to mark the parameter as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings; it is a deliberate documentation/diagnostic aid rather than accidental/meaningless code. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids operations that can be removed without affecting the program behaviour at run-time; removing this cast would not change the program\u2019s run-time behaviour, but it would change compile-time diagnostics and the author\u2019s intent. In practice this idiom is the standard way to document an unused parameter and avoid spurious warnings and is not treated as a defect under MISRA\u2019s intent. Therefore the agent A report (that this is a Rule 2.2 violation) is incorrect."
