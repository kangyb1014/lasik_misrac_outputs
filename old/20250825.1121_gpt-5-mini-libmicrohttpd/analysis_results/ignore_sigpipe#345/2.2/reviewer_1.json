Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of ignore_sigpipe.\n```c\nstatic void\nignore_sigpipe (void)\n{\n  struct sigaction oldsig;\n  struct sigaction sig;\n\n  sig.sa_handler = &catcher;\n  sigemptyset (&sig.sa_mask);\n#ifdef SA_INTERRUPT\n  sig.sa_flags = SA_INTERRUPT;  /* SunOS */\n#else\n  sig.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;\n#endif\n  if (0 != sigaction (SIGPIPE, &sig, &oldsig))\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to install SIGPIPE handler: %s\\n\", strerror (errno));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local variable 'oldsig' is provided solely to receive the previous SIGPIPE handler via sigaction(&oldsig) but is never read or used afterwards. The write performed by sigaction into &oldsig is executed but has no effect on program behaviour; removing the storage (e.g. passing NULL as the third argument) would not change behaviour. Therefore this constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function ignore_sigpipe:\nstatic void\ncatcher (int sig)\n{\n  (void) sig;  /* Unused.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The local object oldsig is supplied as the out-parameter to sigaction so that the library call writes the previous handler into that storage; that write is an executed side\u2011effect. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour, but removing the storage and changing the call (e.g. passing NULL) would change the sequence of memory accesses and may change observable behaviour (timing, page\u2011faults, interaction with debuggers/analysis tools, etc.). In other words the write into oldsig is not provably a no\u2011op and so cannot be categorically treated as dead code. (If the intent is simply to ignore the old handler, the clearer fix is to pass NULL to sigaction or eliminate the unused variable; that is a code-quality change but does not prove a Rule 2.2 violation in itself.)"
