Thus the cast-to-void and the no-op body constitute dead code (a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2).\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function ignore_sigpipe:\nstatic void\ncatcher (int sig)\n{\n  (void) sig;  /* Unused.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The installed catcher is not dead code: installing a no-op signal handler for SIGPIPE changes program behaviour (it prevents the default terminate action), so the handler itself is observable and cannot be removed without changing behaviour. The single statement \u201c(void) sig;\u201d inside the handler is the common idiom to silence an unused-parameter warning. Although that cast-expression has no runtime side-effect, it is deliberately present to document/avoid compiler diagnostics; it is not an accidental leftover. In MISRA terms the handler is purposeful and observable, and the void-cast is an allowed pragmatic idiom to suppress warnings rather than an instance of \u201cdead code\u201d in the sense intended by Rule 2.2. Therefore agent A\u2019s claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
