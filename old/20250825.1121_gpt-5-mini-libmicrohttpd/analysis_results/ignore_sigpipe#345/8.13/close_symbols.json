  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA guideline about pointer const-qualification you need the concrete types and prototypes used in ignore_sigpipe:\n\n- struct sigaction (full definition): determines the exact types of its members (sa_handler, sa_mask, sa_flags). The rule depends on whether these member types are pointer types that could/should be const-qualified.\n- sa_handler member type: whether it is a pointer to function and what its precise signature is (affects whether assigning &catcher is type-correct and whether any const qualification would make sense).\n- sigset_t (type of sa_mask): to know whether sa_mask is an object type whose pointer could be const-qualified (sigemptyset takes a pointer to it because it modifies it).\n- catcher (declaration / prototype): to verify the function-pointer type and compatibility with sa_handler and whether it would need/accept const qualification.\n- sigemptyset (prototype): shows it takes sigset_t * (non-const) because it modifies the set \u2014 this justifies non-const pointer usage and is relevant to the MISRA check.\n- sigaction (prototype): critical because its second parameter is const struct sigaction * and third is struct sigaction *; you must confirm these const qualifications to see if passing &sig and &oldsig complies with the guideline.\n- strerror (prototype): returns char * (non-const) in POSIX \u2014 needed to assess whether using its result in fprintf violates the pointer-to-const recommendation (and whether the API prevents adding const).\n- errno (declaration / type): used as argument to strerror; include to confirm its type (int) though not a pointer, for completeness of the call chain.\n- fprintf (prototype): to see expected types for format and %s arguments (format is const char *; the %s operand is a char * passed through variadic), which matters for constness analysis of the argument from strerror.\n- FILE type and stderr (declaration): to confirm prototype of fprintf and types involved; included to fully understand pointer types used in the fprintf call.\n\nThese symbols give the necessary type/prototype context to decide whether any pointer in ignore_sigpipe should be const-qualified (or cannot be because of the called APIs), and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
