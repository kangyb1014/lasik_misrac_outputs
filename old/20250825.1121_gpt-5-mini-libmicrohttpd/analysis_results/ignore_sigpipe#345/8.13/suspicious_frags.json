  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not present pointer targets that could reasonably be const-qualified for this MISRA rule: local struct declarations (struct sigaction oldsig; struct sigaction sig;), scalar assignments (sig.sa_flags = ...), the function header/return type, preprocessor directives, and braces/control flow. Additionally, many pointer uses in this context are calls to system/library APIs whose prototypes either require non-const pointers or are intended to modify the pointed-to object; those API-level constraints mean such locations are not candidates for adding const qualifiers and therefore were not listed above."
