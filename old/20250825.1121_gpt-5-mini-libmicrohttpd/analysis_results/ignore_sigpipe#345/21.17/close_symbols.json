  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol (why required for the MISRA C string\u2011function bound check):\n\n- catcher: The address of this signal handler is stored in sig.sa_handler. Confirming its prototype and implementation ensures the target function does not pass any pointer or buffer from the caller into a routine that might use <string.h> functions unsafely (even though ignore_sigpipe only stores the pointer).\n\n- sigaction (function): The call to sigaction passes pointers to struct sigaction objects. Analyzer must know the prototype/semantics to confirm no user buffers are forwarded to system routines that could call string.h functions on them or otherwise cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n\n- sigemptyset (function): It operates on a sigset_t pointer (passed from sig.sa_mask). Confirming its behavior ensures it does not expect or manipulate user string buffers and therefore cannot produce a string.h related out\u2011of\u2011bounds access through the pointer parameters used here.\n\n- struct sigaction (type): The layout/fields (sa_handler, sa_mask, sa_flags, etc.) are needed to verify which pointers are stored/passed (sa_handler and sa_mask) and to ensure no embedded char* or user buffer fields exist that could be handed to string.h functions.\n\n- sigset_t (type): Inspecting this type confirms that sigemptyset/sigaction operate on signal set objects, not character buffers; this helps rule out string.h violations stemming from these calls.\n\n- SIGPIPE (macro/constant): The signal number passed to sigaction identifies which handler is installed. Knowing that only a signal constant is passed confirms no string pointers are forwarded via this argument.\n\n- SA_INTERRUPT / SA_RESTART (macros): Flags assigned to sa_flags affect kernel/system behavior but are not pointer parameters; including them documents that only flag values are used (no string buffers are involved).\n\n- fprintf (function): ignore_sigpipe calls fprintf with stderr and a format string plus strerror(errno). Because fprintf is a library output routine, the analyzer must know it does not copy user\u2011supplied pointer buffers in a way that could violate the string\u2011bounds rule (it prints the format and supplied strings but does not write into caller buffers).\n\n- stderr (symbol, FILE*): The FILE* destination passed to fprintf is a library object; confirm that passing it does not cause any library code to operate on caller supplied memory buffers via string.h functions.\n\n- strerror (function): Called to format errno into a message string. The analyzer must know its contract (returns pointer to static storage or thread\u2011local buffer) so it can conclude that ignore_sigpipe does not supply user buffers to string.h functions and that any string returned is not written into caller memory causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds access.\n\n- errno (identifier): errno is passed to strerror; include it to show the only data flowing into string routines is an integer error code (not a pointer/length pair), so there is no risk of indexing past a caller buffer in the present call chain.\n\nThese symbols let the next analyst verify whether any pointer/length arguments which could be subject to <string.h> functions are created or forwarded by ignore_sigpipe. In this function the pointers involved are to sigaction/sigset objects and library/format strings; none are caller buffers that could be overrun by standard string.h calls, but the listed symbols are needed to make that determination formally."
