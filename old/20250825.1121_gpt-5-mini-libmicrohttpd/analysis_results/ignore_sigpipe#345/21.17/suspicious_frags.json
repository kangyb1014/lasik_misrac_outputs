  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided code use any of the <string.h> functions that take pointer parameters referencing caller-provided destination/source objects (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) that are the focus of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The only string-related function present is strerror(errno) which does not take a caller-supplied buffer pointer (it returns a pointer to an internal/static message); therefore it cannot cause accesses beyond the bounds of a caller-provided object as described by the rule. All other calls (sigaction, sigemptyset, fprintf) are unrelated to the <string.h> functions covered by Rule 21.17. Consequently, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate under this rule."
