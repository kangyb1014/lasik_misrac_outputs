  "explanation": "For MISRA C pointer const-qualification analysis we must know whether the function or any callees can modify the pointed-to objects. The following symbols are required: \n\n- struct MHD_Connection: needed to see all fields accessed (keepalive, rp.response, read_closed, discard_request, stop_with_error, rq) and to verify whether any field writes occur in this function. Also required to determine whether pointers to MHD_Connection could/should be 'const'.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: r is derived from connection->rp.response and the code reads r->flags, r->flags_auto, r->upgrade_handler. We must confirm these fields are not modified here and whether they are volatile/mutable types that would prevent const qualification.\n\n- struct MHD_Request (or the exact type of rq.http_ver): needed because http_ver is read and passed to version-check macros; its type may affect whether const qualification is appropriate.\n\n- enum MHD_ConnKeepAlive and enumerators (MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE, MHD_CONN_USE_KEEPALIVE, MHD_CONN_MUST_UPGRADE): needed to understand return values but mainly to ensure no unintended writes are required to produce these values (helps confirm the function is read-only w.r.t. connection/response).\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci (prototype): the single callee that receives the connection pointer; its signature (whether it accepts a const struct MHD_Connection * or non-const) determines whether making the connection pointer point-to-const would be compatible. Also its implementation could modify headers via the connection pointer; the prototype/definition is therefore essential.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED and MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT (macros/functions), MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0 (constant): these macros/functions are invoked with rq.http_ver. Their declarations/macros show whether they take their argument by value and whether they have side effects that might require non-const access to the request object.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION (macro/constant): used as an argument to the header lookup function; included to inspect the lookup call and confirm no mutation is implied.\n\n- MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT, MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE, MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER (flag macros): these are bitmasks tested against response/response_auto flags. Knowing their definitions ensures that the tests are read-only and don't require mutation of the pointed-to response.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro): although likely side-effect free in normal builds, its definition must be checked to ensure it doesn't perform non-const operations on the pointed objects (e.g., mutate or log via non-const API) that would prevent const qualification.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether keepalive_possible and its callees treat the pointed-to structures as read-only (so pointers could/should be const) or whether non-const access is required (preventing const qualification)."
