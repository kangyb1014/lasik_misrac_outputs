  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d). In the provided project mhd_assert is defined as #define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0). That expansion is a null-expression / no-op that does not generate an executed operation and thus is not an \u201coperation that is executed\u201d as required by the rule. Removing the assertion call from the source does not remove an executed operation, so it does not meet the rule's definition of dead code. (If mhd_assert were defined to produce runtime checks in this same project configuration then the call would not be dead; and in multi-configuration projects care should be taken because different macro definitions can change whether code is dead in a given build.)"
