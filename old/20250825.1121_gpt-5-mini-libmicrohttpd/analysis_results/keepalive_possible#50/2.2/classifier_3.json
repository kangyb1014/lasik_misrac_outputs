Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of keepalive_possible:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_ConnKeepAlive\nkeepalive_possible (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; /**< a short alias */\n  struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response;  /**< a short alias */\n\n  mhd_assert (NULL != r);\n  if (MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE == c->keepalive)\n    return MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE;\n\n#ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT\n  /* TODO: Move below the next check when MHD stops closing connections\n   * when response is queued in first callback */\n  if (NULL != r->upgrade_handler)\n  {\n    /* No \"close\" token is enforced by 'add_response_header_connection()' */\n    mhd_assert (0 == (r->flags_auto & MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE));\n    /* Valid HTTP version is enforced by 'MHD_queue_response()' */\n    mhd_assert (MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED (c->rq.http_ver));\n    mhd_assert (! c->stop_with_error);\n    return MHD_CONN_MUST_UPGRADE;\n  }\n#endif /* UPGRADE_SUPPORT */\n\n  mhd_assert ( (! c->stop_with_error) || (c->discard_request));\n  if ((c->read_closed) || (c->discard_request))\n    return MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE;\n\n  if (0 != (r->flags & MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT))\n    return MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE;\n  if (0 != (r->flags_auto & MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE))\n    return MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE;\n\n  if (!

  "scenario": "The check for HTTP/1.1 compatibility is reachable and affects control flow: if it is true the function returns MHD_CONN_USE_KEEPALIVE, otherwise it returns MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE. Removing this test would change behavior for connections that are supported and not HTTP/1.0, so it cannot be proven dead from the provided code. There is no evidence that the condition is always true or always false given the supplied macros and earlier checks, so the fragment is not dead code."
