  "explanation": "I flagged all assertion statements (mhd_assert(...)) because, per the provided additional code, mhd_assert is defined as ((void)0). Those assertion statements therefore compile to no-ops and are prime candidates for dead-code analysis. I also flagged the entire UPGRADE_SUPPORT block (as present in the function) and the HTTP-version-specific blocks because they contain branches that may be never taken depending on build-time configuration or the set of supported HTTP versions; these should be checked to determine whether any branches are effectively dead in the project configuration.\n\nOther fragments in the function were not flagged because they perform runtime-dependent checks or affect control flow and therefore cannot be removed without changing behaviour: the pointer aliasing (c and r) is used throughout; the checks for keepalive state, read_closed, discard_request, response flags, header lookups (MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci), and the final return statements all influence the function's result based on runtime data and so are not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2 unless further analysis of the project shows particular conditions are statically guaranteed. In short: only the assertion calls (given the provided mhd_assert macro) and the annotated version/upgrade branches were marked for investigation; the remaining statements are runtime-dependent and thus not reported as suspicious."
