  "explanation": "For MISRA C rule checking about string.h bounds safety you must inspect any code that could call or use Standard Library string functions or that relies on string storage/layout. The items above are required because:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): keepalive_possible dereferences many fields (rp, rq.http_ver, keepalive, read_closed, discard_request, stop_with_error). Understanding their types/layout and especially how request/response headers are referenced is necessary to trace any pointer passed to string functions and to ensure no out-of-bounds access when those pointers are used.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (full definition): the function reads r->flags, r->flags_auto and r->upgrade_handler. The response object also typically contains or references the stored response headers; you must see how those header strings/lengths are kept to determine whether any string operations in called helpers can overrun buffers.\n\n- struct for request (rq) and http_ver field type: the code branches on request HTTP version; knowing the type and any macros that map versions affects which code paths (and thus which string ops) are reachable.\n\n- enum/values for MHD_ConnKeepAlive: needed to understand returned values and any contracts about special values (not directly about string bounds but required for full control-flow analysis).\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci (prototype and implementation or precise contract): this is the only function here that plausibly invokes string.h functions to find a token in a header value. To determine MISRA compliance you must inspect its implementation to see whether it uses functions such as strlen, strstr, strchr, memcmp, etc., and whether it uses stored header lengths or relies on NUL-termination. If it uses string.h routines, check that it always bounds-checks against the stored header length and does not read past allocated buffers.\n\n- representation/type of header storage and header-list elements used by MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci: you must know whether header values are stored as NUL-terminated C strings, as length-prefixed buffers, or as slices into a larger receive buffer. That representation determines whether string.h functions can safely be used or whether calls could read beyond the valid memory.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION constant: the header name passed into the lookup function; knowing its type (const char*) is trivial but confirms argument types for the lookup call.\n\n- Flags/constants (MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT, MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE, MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER): these affect control flow and indicate whether earlier code paths (which might manipulate headers) were taken; they also show which fields of response are used to decide whether a lookup is performed.\n\n- HTTP-version macros (MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0, MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED, MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT): these determine which branches are taken and therefore whether MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci is invoked on particular paths. For MISRA analysis you must know reachable paths so you can focus on the string-using code.\n\n- mhd_assert macro: assertions may document or enforce invariants (e.g., non-NULL pointers, absence of certain flags) that guarantee safe use of header strings; you need those definitions to know whether invariants eliminate risky code paths.\n\nIn short: the critical symbol to inspect is MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci plus the concrete representation of header storage (and the request/response structs that reference headers). The other listed symbols are required to see which code paths invoke the lookup and which invariants hold before it is called. Together these let you determine whether any string.h usage can read beyond buffer bounds."
