  "explanation": "The rest of the function consists of pointer dereferences, flag checks, enum returns, assertions and version-check macros, none of which directly invoke the standard <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). No other calls in this fragment pass character-buffer pointers that would indicate direct use of those string.h routines. The two MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci calls are the only points that plausibly perform string/token operations on header data and therefore must be investigated to ensure they do not access beyond object bounds."
