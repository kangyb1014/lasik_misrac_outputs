  "explanation": "For a sound determination of whether any branch in keepalive_possible is provably unreachable, the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - The function inspects many fields of the connection (keepalive, rq.http_ver, rp.response, read_closed, discard_request, stop_with_error). The structure definition is required to know these members exist, their types, and whether any are const/bitfields or otherwise constrained by the type, which affects whether branches can be proved impossible.\n\n- struct MHD_Response\n  - The code uses r->upgrade_handler, r->flags_auto and r->flags. The response structure definition (and member types) is needed to reason about the bit-tests and pointer-null checks and thus reachability of branches that depend on those members.\n\n- enum MHD_ConnKeepAlive and the enum constants MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE, MHD_CONN_MUST_UPGRADE, MHD_CONN_USE_KEEPALIVE\n  - The first test compares c->keepalive to one of these enum values and the function returns enum values. To prove a branch never executes you must know the enum domain and any invariants about keepalive values (and whether any value is impossible), so the enum and its values are required.\n\n- Flag mask definitions: MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT, MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE, MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER\n  - These are used in bitwise tests (r->flags & MASK, flags_auto & MASK). Their definitions (bit positions, possible compile-time values) are needed to determine if a test can ever be true or is a constant expression, which directly bears on unreachable-ness of branches guarded by those tests.\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci (aka MHD_lookup_header_token_ci)\n  - The function is called multiple times; its return semantics (NULL vs non-NULL for present token, side-effects, whether it can be a compile-time constant) determine reachability of the branches that depend on header lookups. The prototype/semantics are required to assess if those checks can never succeed or always succeed.\n\n- HTTP-version helpers and constants: MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED, MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT, MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0\n  - These macros/functions decide which version-related branches are taken. Their definitions/semantics (e.g., does MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED always evaluate true for the stored type?) are necessary to show any version-related branch is unreachable.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION\n  - The header-name token passed to the lookup function; while not usually determinative of reachability by itself, its definition may matter if the lookup is implemented as a constant/no-op in some builds; include it to be able to reason about header lookup behavior.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The code contains multiple mhd_assert calls that express invariants. Whether mhd_assert is enabled/compiled out or aborts the program can change whether subsequent code is reachable in practice; the assert macro/implementation is required to know if those checks create unreachable paths.\n\n- UPGRADE_SUPPORT (preprocessor symbol)\n  - The upgrade-handling block is conditional on this macro. Whether that block exists or is removed at compile time is fundamental to whether the code inside it is reachable (and therefore whether it violates the \"no unreachable code\" rule in the build under analysis).\n\n- setup_reply_properties\n  - This function is the caller shown in the static call graph and may establish invariants (initialize response pointer, set keepalive, set flags, or set stop_with_error/discard_request) before calling keepalive_possible. To prove some branches inside keepalive_possible unreachable, the caller(s) must be inspected for guarantees they provide; setup_reply_properties is the entrypoint shown and must be examined.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any if/return path in keepalive_possible is provably never executed you need the connection/response layouts and semantics of the flags/macros/lookup/assertion utilities and the compile-time flag that conditionally includes code, plus the caller that may establish invariants. These symbols are the minimal set required to reach a sound conclusion about unreachable code in this function."
