  "explanation": "For each controlling expression in keepalive_possible you must know whether it can be evaluated to a constant/invariant or depends on runtime state. The listed symbols are required for that determination:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function reads many of its controlling expressions from fields of the connection (keepalive, rq.http_ver, rp.response, read_closed, discard_request, stop_with_error). You need the struct layout and member types to know whether these are runtime-modifiable values or compile-time constants.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The code inspects response members (upgrade_handler, flags, flags_auto). Their types and how flags are represented are needed to assess whether expressions like (r->flags & ...) or (r->upgrade_handler != NULL) are invariant.\n\n- enum MHD_ConnKeepAlive (MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE, MHD_CONN_MUST_UPGRADE, MHD_CONN_USE_KEEPALIVE): The first if compares c->keepalive to an enum constant. Knowing the enum and the type of keepalive is needed to determine whether that comparison could ever vary at run time.\n\n- UPGRADE_SUPPORT (preprocessor macro): Controls whether the upgrade-related block is compiled. Whether that block exists affects which controlling expressions are present; you must know if this macro is defined in the build.\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci (prototype/semantics): Two controlling expressions call this function. You must know its signature and observable behavior (does it inspect connection/request headers only and have no constant return?) to determine if those calls can be invariant in a given build/context.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION: The header identifier passed to MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci; needed to determine which header is checked and whether that can be treated as constant for the call semantics.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED (macro/function): Used in a controlling expression that depends on rq.http_ver. You need to know whether this is a compile-time constant for certain http_ver values or a runtime check.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT (macro/function): Used in the final controlling expression. Its definition/semantics determine whether that test can be invariant for certain rq.http_ver values.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0: The code compares rq.http_ver against this constant. You must know the representation/value of HTTP version constants to decide if the comparison is ever invariant.\n\n- MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT: Bitmask tested against r->flags. Knowing its value and flags type is necessary to decide if the bit-test can be an invariant.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE: Bitmask tested against r->flags_auto. Required to decide whether the flags_auto test is potentially invariant.\n\n- MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER: Bitmask tested against response->flags in the HTTP/1.0 branch. Needed to assess invariance of that test.\n\n- type/representation of rq.http_ver (enum/typedef for HTTP version): Several tests operate on rq.http_ver (equality to MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0 and the IS_HTTP_VER_* macros). Knowing the type (enum/integers) and possible values is required to determine if those comparisons/resolutions are constant for a given build.\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyst determine whether each controlling expression depends on runtime-modifiable values or on compile-time constants/macros (and thus whether any controlling expression is invariant and violates the MISRA rule)."
