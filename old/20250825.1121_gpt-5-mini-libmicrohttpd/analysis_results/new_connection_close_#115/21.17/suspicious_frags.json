  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appears in this function. The code only performs assertions, conditional TLS deinitialization (gnutls_deinit), socket close, a call to MHD_ip_limit_del, and frees (free(connection->addr); free(connection)). None of these are direct uses of the banned string functions or perform buffer copies/concatenations that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses from string.h routines. The mhd_assert macro and conditional compilation blocks do not introduce string.h calls here. While the external function MHD_ip_limit_del (and other called functions) might themselves use string.h functions, that usage is outside the provided fragment and must be inspected in their own implementations \u2014 there are no in-fragment string.h calls to investigate. Therefore no code fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 21.17."
