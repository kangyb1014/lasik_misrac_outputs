  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The snippet uses only standard C constructs: function definition, pointers to structs, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #endif), function calls, standard library free(), and macro-like identifiers (mhd_assert, MHD_socket_close_chk_, MHD_ip_limit_del) \u2014 none of which in this fragment show any compiler-specific extensions (no __attribute__, no __asm, no typeof, no statement-expressions ({...}), no nested functions, no zero-sized array usage, no #pragma GCC, no extended integer types, etc.).\n\nNote: Some identifiers here are macros or calls (mhd_assert, MHD_socket_close_chk_, MHD_ip_limit_del, gnutls_deinit). Those macros or functions could expand to or call compiler-specific extensions, but the expansions/definitions are not present in this fragment. Because Rule 1.2 requires reporting only when the code uses language compiler extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions, and there is no evidence of such extensions in the shown code, nothing is reported. If the definitions of the macros or other referenced code are provided and contain compiler-specific extensions, those should be re-evaluated."
