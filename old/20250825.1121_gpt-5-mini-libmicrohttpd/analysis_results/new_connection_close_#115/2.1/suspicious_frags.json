  "explanation": "No unreachable code constructs were identified in this function. There are no return statements, goto labels, or loop constructs that would cause subsequent statements to be statically unreachable. Conditional blocks are controlled by runtime checks (e.g., if (NULL != connection->tls_session)) or by preprocessing macros (#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT, #ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT); when those macros are not defined the corresponding code is not present in the translation unit (not statically unreachable), and when they are defined the guarded code is reachable at runtime depending on the condition. The mhd_assert calls are runtime assertions (typically no-ops in non-debug builds) and do not by themselves create statically unreachable code. Finally, the function ends after freeing connection and contains no statements following the free that would be unreachable. Therefore no code fragments in this function require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
