  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s claim is not correct. While it is true that the C standard specifies free(NULL) is a no-op, that by itself does not automatically make the NULL-check \u201cdead code\u201d under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Rule 2.2 requires that removal of the code must not affect program behaviour. Removing the conditional would (under a strictly conforming C library) produce the same result for the memory-management semantics, but it can still change observable behaviour in embedded systems (timing, call traces, logging, interposed/wrapped allocators, or non-conforming platform libraries). MISRA\u2019s note 1 explicitly points out that timing can matter in embedded systems, so the presence/absence of a call (even one that is a no-op per the abstract C specification) can affect system behaviour. Moreover, defensive coding for non-conforming runtimes or for clearer intent are valid reasons for keeping the guard. If the project team decides the check is unnecessary, its removal should be justified and recorded as a deviation; it is not an automatic MISRA 2.2 violation as asserted by agent A."
