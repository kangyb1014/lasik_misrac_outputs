  "scenario": "The statement is an assertion (mhd_assert) used to check an invariant. In normal diagnostic builds the assertion can affect behaviour (it may abort when the condition fails), so removing it would change behaviour and it is not dead code. Therefore, as written this does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. However, if in the project mhd_assert is defined as a no-op in all builds (for example #define mhd_assert(x) ((void)0) or removed by preprocessing in every configuration), then the statement has no effect and its removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 in that configuration it would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2."
