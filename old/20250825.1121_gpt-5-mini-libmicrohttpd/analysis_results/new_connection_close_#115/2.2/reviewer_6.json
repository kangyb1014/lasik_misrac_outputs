If the condition is always true in correct operation or the macro is compiled out, the assertion has no effect on program behaviour; its execution (or presence) can be removed without changing behaviour, which meets the definition of dead code in Rule 2.2. Example violation: mhd_assert expands to ((void)0) in release builds or only logs diagnostics\u2014removing the call does not alter program behaviour.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. You cannot conclude that the mhd_assert calls in new_connection_close_ are dead code without knowing how mhd_assert is defined for the project configuration. If mhd_assert expands to a checking/diagnostic routine (e.g. abort, logging) in some builds then its removal would change behaviour and it is not dead. If it expands to ((void)0) in a particular build, then the assertion is not present or executed in that build (so it is not \u201cdead code\u201d by the rule\u2019s definition which requires the operation to be executed). Furthermore, the rest of the function performs real effects (socket close, ip limit removal, free) that clearly are not dead. Therefore the report is not justified on the information given \u2014 you need the actual definition/configuration of mhd_assert to make a valid Rule 2.2 diagnosis."
