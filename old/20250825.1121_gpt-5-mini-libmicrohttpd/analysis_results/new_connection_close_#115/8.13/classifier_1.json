  "scenario": "Not violated in this fragment: connection->addr is being deallocated (ownership is transferred to free), so it must be a non-const pointer. A concrete violation scenario would be if connection->addr were declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. const char *addr) and then passed to free without an explicit cast \u2014 that would contradict Rule 8.13 or force a cast to remove constness."
