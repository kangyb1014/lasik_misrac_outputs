  "explanation": "No pointer-to-non-const occurrences that need investigation were found. Specifically:\n- The input string parameter is declared as const char *http_string, and the local alias is const char *const h \u2014 both already point to const-qualified data.\n- The only other pointer parameter is struct MHD_Connection *connection; this must remain non-const because the function assigns to connection->rq.http_ver and passes the connection to transmit_error_response_static (which presumably mutates or relies on a mutable connection). Making the pointed-to type const would prevent these legitimate modifications.\n- No other pointer variables or pointer targets appear in the function.\nTherefore, there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 that require investigation."
