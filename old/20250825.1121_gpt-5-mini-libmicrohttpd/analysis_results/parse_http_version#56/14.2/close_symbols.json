Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check the MISRA C rule about well-formed for loops:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): The function reads and writes connection->rq.http_ver. The full definition is needed to determine whether these accesses are plain object assignments or whether the field is a macro/inline accessor that could hide side effects or internal for loops.\n\n- type/definition of connection->rq and field http_ver (enum/type): Knowing the type (enum vs. macro, whether http_ver is a plain scalar) is necessary to confirm assignments (connection->rq.http_ver = ...) are simple object writes and not function-like macros or expressions that could contain loops or modify other objects used in a for loop analysis.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_VER_INVALID, MHD_HTTP_VER_1_1, MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0, MHD_HTTP_VER_1_2__1_9, MHD_HTTP_VER_TOO_OLD, MHD_HTTP_VER_FUTURE: These identifiers assigned to http_ver must be known to verify they are simple constants (enum literals or integer macros). If any expand to complex expressions or function-like macros they could introduce side effects or loops that are relevant to the MISRA for-loop rule.\n\n- HTTP_VER_LEN: Used in the initial conditional (HTTP_VER_LEN != len). The symbol must be checked to ensure it is a plain integer constant and not a macro or expression that could have side effects or contain loops.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function): Called at the start; macros in particular can expand to code with control structures. To be certain no for loops (or side effects that would affect loop counters) are introduced here, the definition of mhd_assert must be examined.\n\n- transmit_error_response_static (prototype + implementation): This function is called on error paths. Even though parse_http_version itself contains no for loops, if any for loop existed in the function body it would include the behaviour of called functions. To be thorough we must confirm that this callee (and whether it is actually the same as transmit_error_response_len in the static call graph) does not introduce hidden for loops or modify objects that could be considered loop counters in any for loop in parse_http_version. Also check whether it is a macro wrapper rather than a simple function.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, REQUEST_MALFORMED, MHD_HTTP_HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED, REQ_HTTP_VER_IS_TOO_OLD, REQ_HTTP_VER_IS_NOT_SUPPORTED: These arguments passed into transmit_error_response_static must be verified to be simple constants/identifiers. If any are function-like macros or expand to expressions with control flow/loops or produce side effects, that could affect analysis of for-loop well-formedness (macros can hide loops or modifications to objects used as loop counters).\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule to check concerns the structure and side effects in for-loop clauses and prohibits modifications of the loop counter except in the third clause. To determine whether parse_http_version violates this rule we must ensure (a) the function itself contains no for loops, and (b) none of the macros, field accesses or called functions used in parse_http_version are implemented as macros or functions that hide for loops or side effects affecting potential loop counters. The listed symbols are exactly those referenced by parse_http_version whose definitions/implementations could introduce such hidden control flow or side effects, so they must be inspected."
