  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C const-pointer analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The target function takes a pointer to this struct. To determine whether the parameter can be changed to point-to-const (e.g. const struct MHD_Connection *), we must see the full struct definition to be sure the function does not perform any write-through (direct or indirect) to the object and to check any fields accessed for side effects.\n\n- MHD_Connection::rq (type of rq member): The function accesses c->rq; knowledge of the exact member type is needed to know whether reading that member could invoke non-const behaviour or whether its type has qualifiers that affect whether the pointer can be const-qualified.\n\n- type of rq.http_mthd (enum/type and its possible values): The code compares c->rq.http_mthd against constants. We need the declaration of http_mthd (its type and whether it is an lvalue or macro) to ensure no modification occurs and that accessing it is a const-correct operation.\n\n- enum replyBodyUse: The function returns this enum. While not directly about constness of the pointer parameter, its declaration is needed to confirm semantics of return values and ensure no hidden side effects that would mandate non-const access.\n\n- RP_BODY_NONE, RP_BODY_HEADERS_ONLY, RP_BODY_SEND: The enumerators returned by the function \u2014 include to understand semantics and to verify there are no macros that perform writes or side effects when used.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_NO_CONTENT, MHD_HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED, MHD_HTTP_MTHD_HEAD: These macros/constants are compared against rcode and http_mthd. Their definitions are needed to ensure they are simple integral constants (no side effects) and to confirm that the comparisons do not require non-const access.\n\n- mhd_assert: The function calls mhd_assert(rcode comparisons). The macro/function might have side effects or may evaluate its argument in a way that requires non-const access; its definition is required to verify it does not mutate the connection or its members and thus does not prevent making the pointer-to-const.\n\nNote: The inactive (#if 0) blocks are not compiled, so their symbols (upgrade_handler, MHD_HTTP_MTHD_CONNECT, etc.) are not required for analyzing this function as presented. Also, no callee functions are invoked that take the connection pointer, so analysis can be limited to the above symbols to decide whether the 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' parameter could be declared as pointer-to-const without violating behavior (MISRA rule)."
