  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA C Rule (Controlling expressions shall not be invariant) analysis:\n\n- enum replyBodyUse\n  - Needed to know the return-domain constants and confirm they are plain enum constants (no side effects). Helps determine whether return statements use invariant constants only (which is allowed) or cause other control-flow issues.\n\n- RP_BODY_NONE, RP_BODY_HEADERS_ONLY, RP_BODY_SEND\n  - The specific enumerator constants used in the function. Verify they are simple compile-time constants and do not hide macros or function-like behavior that could affect whether a controlling expression is invariant.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - The function dereferences the connection parameter (alias c). To decide if the controlling expressions involving c->rq.http_mthd can be invariant, the structure layout and member mutability/semantics must be known.\n\n- MHD_Connection::rq\n  - The nested request object (rq) is accessed; its lifetime and whether its fields are mutable determine whether expressions reading them can be treated as variant or invariant.\n\n- MHD_Connection::rq.http_mthd\n  - The controlling expression compares this field to a method constant (MHD_HTTP_MTHD_HEAD). To decide if that comparison is invariant, we need the field's type, possible value set, and whether callers/other code can change it.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_NO_CONTENT\n  - Used in a controlling expression (== rcode). Need its definition/value to know whether the comparison is a simple integer constant and to ensure it is not a macro/function that could affect invariance analysis.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_MTHD_HEAD\n  - Used in controlling expression comparing to c->rq.http_mthd. Must know its definition (constant) and type to evaluate whether the comparison can be invariant.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED\n  - Used in controlling expression (== rcode). Need its definition/value for the same reasons as MHD_HTTP_NO_CONTENT.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The function invokes mhd_assert on rcode range. The analyser must know whether mhd_assert is a no-op, a macro that can change control flow (longjmp/abort), or can mutate state; that affects whether the later if-tests are reachable and whether expressions are effectively invariant.\n\n- setup_reply_properties\n  - A direct caller of is_reply_body_needed. To determine whether any controlling expression inside is_reply_body_needed is invariant in practice, the call-site(s) must be inspected to see what rcode and connection values are passed (e.g., constant rcode or connection with fixed http_mthd). Include this symbol so the next analyser can inspect the caller(s).\n\n- MHD_queue_response\n  - The other direct caller. Same reason as setup_reply_properties: callers may pass constant/immutable arguments or wrap the call in contexts that make the tested expressions invariant; the caller(s) must be inspected to conclude MISRA compliance.\n\nNotes:\n- The #if 0 blocks are not compiled; their symbols (e.g., MHD_HTTP_MTHD_CONNECT) are not required for this analysis unless the build configuration enables them.\n- The function parameter type (unsigned int rcode) is visible in the target function; no additional symbol needed beyond knowledge of callers to decide if rcode is invariant across invocations."
