  "explanation": "No runtime controlling expressions in the provided code are invariant. Each if-condition depends on either the function parameter rcode or members of the connection/request structs (e.g. c->rq.http_mthd, connection->rq.http_ver, status_code), so they are not constant at runtime. There are no loops (while/for/do-while) with constant controlling expressions (and therefore no infinite-loop exceptions to consider). The only code fragments that might look suspicious are inside preprocessor-disabled blocks (#if 0) \u2014 those are compile-time excluded and thus not subject to MISRA Rule 14.3 in the compiled program. The mhd_assert macro is a no-op ((void)0) here, so it does not introduce an invariant controlling expression. Consequently, there are no code fragments in the supplied sources that need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
