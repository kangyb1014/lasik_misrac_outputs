  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not appear to be unreachable and therefore do not require further investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1: - The asserts (mhd_assert) are checks, not compile-time constant conditions, and do not create unreachable code. - The conditional branches (rcode checks and method checks) are based on runtime values (rcode and c->rq.http_mthd) and are therefore potentially reachable at runtime. - The final return RP_BODY_SEND is the default reachable exit when no earlier condition matches. - No other dead or constant-false conditions are present outside the two #if 0 blocks. The only code that is effectively unreachable in the provided snippet are the two sections excluded by the preprocessor (#if 0 ... #endif), which should be investigated (or removed) to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
