  "explanation": "Other pointer occurrences in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the string parameters in the signature that are already const-qualified (url, method, version, upload_data) are correctly const; the request-class double pointer is intentionally modified by the function (it stores and clears a client-specific pointer) so the pointed-to object cannot be const; local object handles and responses (e.g. FILE *file, struct MHD_Response *response) are used as opaque, mutable library objects and therefore must remain non-const; callback/function pointer usages (file_reader, free_callback) and passing &url[1] to fopen are appropriate and not candidates for adding const. The listed fragments are the places where const-qualification might be applicable and should be checked further."
