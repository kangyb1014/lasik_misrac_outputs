  "explanation": "I examined the call graph for get_unquoted_param and the related functions provided. get_unquoted_param calls: - mhd_assert (macro) - get_buffer_for_size - MHD_str_unquote None of these functions call get_unquoted_param, and there are no function pointers, callbacks, or global-state-driven indirect calls shown that could cause a return path to get_unquoted_param. get_buffer_for_size only calls free, malloc and mhd_assert; MHD_str_unquote contains only a local loop writing to result and returns a size. There are no self-calls and no cycles between the shown functions, so no direct or indirect recursion is present in the provided code. Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA Rule 17.2 based on the supplied code. (If mhd_assert is a project-specific macro that expands to a function call, that expansion should be reviewed, but in typical implementations it does not introduce recursion.)"
