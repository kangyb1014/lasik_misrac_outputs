  "explanation": "I selected the fragments that are relevant to potential out-of-bounds accesses when handling/allocating buffers for the unquoted value: the callsite that obtains the destination buffer, the buffer-allocation helper (get_buffer_for_size) which allocates buffers of size required_size, the unquote routine (MHD_str_unquote) which writes bytes into the provided result buffer, and the macros that define the static buffer size and maximum parameter size. These are the only places in the provided code that perform memory allocation or write into a destination buffer and thus are the relevant loci to investigate for possible violations of Rule 21.17.\n\nOther parts of the supplied code (assertions, simple assignments, return statements, and the control flow in get_unquoted_param) do not themselves perform string.h operations or buffer writes and therefore do not, by themselves, present potential MISRA Rule 21.17 issues; any risk of out-of-bounds access stems from the interactions between allocation size and the write loop, which is why the allocation function and the write routine (and the call that ties them together) were included above. Also, there are no direct uses of <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) in the provided snippets; if such calls exist elsewhere in the codebase operating on the unquoted buffer, those call sites should also be investigated."
