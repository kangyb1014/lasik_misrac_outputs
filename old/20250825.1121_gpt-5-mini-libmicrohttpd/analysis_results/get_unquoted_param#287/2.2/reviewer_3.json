  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead code, defined as any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. In the provided project mhd_assert is defined as ((void)0). Therefore each use like\n  mhd_assert(0 != param->value.len);\nexpands to an executed no-op expression-statement ((void)0);. Those statements execute but have no effect and could be removed without changing program behaviour, which meets the rule's definition of dead code. Hence the agent A report is correct: this code (as configured with mhd_assert defined to ((void)0)) violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
