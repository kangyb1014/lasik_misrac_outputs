  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. With the given definition #define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0) each mhd_assert(...) call becomes an executed no-op expression statement (effectively (void)0;). Removing those statements would not change the program behaviour, so they meet the rule 2.2 definition of dead code. (If the macro were defined to perform checks or side effects in some builds, then those uses might not be dead in those builds; but as shown here they are dead and therefore violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.)"
