  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments as suspicious because they perform observable work or affect program behaviour and thus are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2: - The non-quoted branch (assigning unquoted->str/unquoted->len and returning) is behaviourally relevant and removal would change results. - The call to get_buffer_for_size and its return-value checks (including the NULL check and the subsequent error-return using the ternary) affect control flow and error reporting. - The buffer-selection logic inside get_buffer_for_size (return tmp1 when small, return *ptmp2 when it fits, allocate/free when needed, update *ptmp2_size) performs memory management that changes runtime behaviour if removed. - The MHD_str_unquote routine contains the actual unquoting loop and the early-return on malformed input; removing or altering that loop would change the produced output and error handling. - The malloc/free calls, assignments to *ptmp2 and *ptmp2_size, and the returns from functions are functional operations whose removal would change observable behaviour. The selected fragments are the assertion calls (and the macro definition) which, as defined here, expand to a no-op ((void)0) and therefore constitute executed statements that do not affect program behaviour; these should be investigated for potential dead code under Rule 2.2."
