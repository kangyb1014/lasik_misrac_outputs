  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. I checked for common compiler-specific extensions that would violate MISRA C Rule 1.2 (examples: GCC/Clang statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__ annotations, inline asm, extended asm, nested or anonymous structs/unions as a compiler extension, non-standard inline function semantics, identifier prefixes like __extension__, or other documented compiler-specific language extensions). None appear here.\n\nSpecific notes on constructs that might look non-standard but are not compiler language extensions:\n- ssize_t, uintptr_t, uint64_t, int64_t, off_t, etc. are standard POSIX/ISO types or types from stdint.h (not language extensions). Their use is a library/platform dependency, not a compiler language extension.\n- HANDLE, OVERLAPPED, ULARGE_INTEGER and ReadFile/_get_osfhandle are Windows API types/functions (platform-specific), not compiler language extensions.\n- The aggregate initializer OVERLAPPED f_ol = {0, 0, {{0, 0}}, 0}; uses nested braces which are valid C initializers (not a compiler extension).\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#if defined(...)) and casts are standard C preprocessor and language features.\n- Use of platform-specific functions (pread64, pread, lseek64, lseek, read) and macros (HAVE_PREAD64, etc.) are feature-detection and platform portability code, not language extensions.\n\nBecause none of the above are compiler-documented language extensions, there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 for use of language extensions."
