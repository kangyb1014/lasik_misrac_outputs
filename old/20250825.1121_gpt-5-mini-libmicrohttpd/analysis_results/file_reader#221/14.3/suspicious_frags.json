  "explanation": "Other conditional expressions in the function are dependent on runtime values (e.g. offset64, n, max, fh, resRead, return values from read/pread/lseek/ReadFile) and therefore are not invariant. The preprocessor conditionals (#if / #else / #endif) select platform-specific code at compile time and are not runtime controlling expressions subject to Rule 14.3. There are no loops with constant controlling expressions in the provided code. Therefore only the two occurrences shown above \u2014 where a compile-time sizeof comparison is combined with a runtime comparison in a single controlling expression \u2014 warrant investigation for potential invariance; the remaining conditionals should not be investigated for Rule 14.3."
