  "explanation": "For checking MISRA's 'controlling expressions shall not be invariant' you must be able to decide which conditional expressions can be evaluated at compile- or run-time to a constant. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- struct MHD_Response (fd, fd_off): offset64 = (int64_t)(pos + response->fd_off) is used in several ifs. The types and signedness/width of fd_off and fd determine whether offset64 < 0 is ever possible and whether casts truncate or produce invariant values.\n\n- ssize_t and SSIZE_MAX: used for the return type and the test if (max > SSIZE_MAX). To decide if that controlling expression can be invariant (always false/true) you need the exact ssize_t range (SSIZE_MAX).\n\n- size_t, uint64_t, int64_t: types of max and pos/offset64; their widths and signedness affect whether comparisons (e.g. offset64 < 0, max > SSIZE_MAX, casts) can be constant.\n\n- off_t and sizeof(off_t): the code uses sizeof(off_t) < sizeof(uint64_t) as a runtime controlling expression. That sizeof comparison is a compile-time constant on any given platform \u2014 to decide if this expression is invariant you must know off_t's size on the target platform.\n\n- INT32_MAX: used in comparisons (offset64 > (uint64_t)INT32_MAX and to clamp to INT32_MAX for toRead). Its value is required to know if those tests can be constant.\n\n- HAVE_PREAD64, HAVE_PREAD, HAVE_LSEEK64: these preprocessor macros select alternative code paths. To know which controlling expressions actually exist in the compiled unit (and therefore which invariants to check) you must know which of these macros are defined.\n\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: similarly determine whether the POSIX or Windows branch is compiled; they thus determine which controlling expressions are present.\n\n- pread64, pread, read, lseek64, lseek, SEEK_SET: prototypes and return types (and semantics) are needed to reason about comparisons like lseek(...) != offset64 and reads returning 0 or negative values (0 == n, n < 0). The return-type widths affect whether comparisons are invariant or meaningful.\n\n- _get_osfhandle, HANDLE, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, ReadFile, OVERLAPPED, ULARGE_INTEGER, DWORD: required to analyse the Windows branch controlling expressions (INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE == fh, !ReadFile(...) and 0 == resRead). You need the semantics, return types and sentinel values to decide if these tests could be invariant.\n\nNote: MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM are return codes used but are not needed to decide whether controlling expressions are invariant \u2014 the above symbols determine whether the conditions themselves can be constant. The preprocessor macros and sizeof(off_t) are particularly important because sizeof(...) and defined/undefined macros produce compile-time invariants which MISRA aims to detect."
