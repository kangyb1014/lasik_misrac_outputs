  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (only what is needed to judge pointer const-qualification):\n\n- struct MHD_Response / MHD_Response::fd / MHD_Response::fd_off: need the definition and types of these fields to determine whether the callback-supplied cls pointer is only read from (so it could be a const void *) or is written to (must be non-const). Knowing the exact types of fd and fd_off also shows whether any indirect writes occur.\n\n- pread / pread64 / read / lseek / lseek64 / ReadFile: these function prototypes show whether the buffer parameter is an output (non-const) argument (they write into the buffer). If these I/O functions require a non-const destination buffer, the local buf parameter must not be const. Also lseek variants show whether any seeking requires writable state (not directly about buf, but relevant to how the fd is used).\n\n- _get_osfhandle: used on Windows path to obtain HANDLE from response->fd; knowing its prototype and whether it mutates its argument helps decide constness requirements on response or its fd field.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR / MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: return-value macros are needed to understand control-flow and whether any pointer is passed to functions that might subsequently modify pointed-to data; they do not change constness but are needed to fully understand code paths.\n\n- ssize_t / size_t / uint64_t / int64_t / off_t / uintptr_t: type definitions are necessary to interpret casts and arithmetic using pointers/offsets and to check whether implicit casts could force changing pointer qualifiers or require conversions that affect const correctness.\n\n- HANDLE / INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE / OVERLAPPED / ULARGE_INTEGER / DWORD: Windows-specific types/constants are required to inspect the Windows code path and determine whether buf or cls are used in ways that would require non-const qualifiers (e.g., ReadFile writes into buf and takes a non-const buffer pointer).\n\n- SSIZE_MAX / INT32_MAX / SEEK_SET: constants used in clamping/limits and seeks help determine which branches are compiled/invoked and therefore which functions (that may require non-const buffers) are actually called.\n\nIn short: to decide whether cls or buf could/should be const-qualified you must see the MHD_Response layout and the prototypes of all I/O functions invoked (to know whether they write into the provided buffer or mutate the response), plus the relevant integer and platform types/macros to understand which code paths are taken."
