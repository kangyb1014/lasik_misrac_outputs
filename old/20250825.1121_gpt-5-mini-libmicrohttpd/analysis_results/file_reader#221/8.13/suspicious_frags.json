  "explanation": "I only flagged locations where a pointer to an object that is only read could/should be const-qualified. The function parameter 'cls' is declared as a plain void * and the code immediately assigns it to a non-const struct MHD_Response *; these are the code sites that require investigation for Rule 8.13 (they appear in the function signature and the assignment). Other pointer uses in the function do not need investigation for this rule: - 'char *buf' is an output buffer written by read/pread/ReadFile and therefore must not be const. - The casts of buf to (void *) for ReadFile are for an API that expects a writable buffer; this is consistent with buf being non-const. - File-descriptor/handle representations (response->fd, fh) are used as opaque identifiers/handles; they are not pointers to data that could be const-qualified in the sense of Rule 8.13. - Local objects such as OVERLAPPED f_ol and ULARGE_INTEGER pos_uli are non-pointer structures and not relevant to pointer-to-const qualification. - Pointers present in the MHD_Response definition that are already const-qualified (for example const char *data) are correctly qualified and need no further investigation. Therefore, no other fragments in the function appear to violate Rule 8.13."
