  "explanation": "No functions from <string.h> are used in the provided file_reader code. The code only calls low-level I/O and OS APIs (pread64, pread, read, lseek/lseek64, ReadFile, etc.) and uses initializers/casts; none of the listed string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear. Therefore there are no fragments that fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 to be investigated. Note: although I/O calls could in general produce out-of-bounds writes if the caller supplies an undersized buf/max, that concern is outside Rule 21.17 which specifically targets use of string.h functions; hence those I/O calls are not reported here."
