  "explanation": "For determining whether this target function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp on null-terminated strings you need to know where memcmp could appear, either directly in this translation unit or indirectly via symbols/macros expanded or functions called by this function. Brief reasons per symbol:\n\n- memcmp: The rule targets use of memcmp. You must know whether memcmp is referenced/used in this function or any called/expanded symbol.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The function treats 'cls' as an MHD_Response pointer and accesses response->fd and response->fd_off. The definition could contain inline functions, macros, or accessors that use memcmp; inspect it to rule that out.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: These are used as return values. If they are macros or inline expressions they could expand to calls (or wrappers) that use memcmp; verify their definitions.\n\n- pread64, pread, read, lseek64, lseek, ReadFile: These are the I/O functions actually invoked on the active compile path. To exclude indirect memcmp usage you must inspect their implementations/wrappers in the project (or confirm they are system calls/CRT functions not using memcmp on C strings). If any are project-provided wrappers they might call memcmp.\n\n- _get_osfhandle: Used on the Windows path to obtain HANDLE from response->fd. The implementation or wrapper could hide memcmp usage; include it in the inspection.\n\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: These platform macros determine which code path is compiled (POSIX vs Windows). To know which functions/wrappers to inspect for memcmp you must know the defined macros for the build.\n\n- HAVE_PREAD64, HAVE_PREAD, HAVE_LSEEK64: These feature-detection macros control which branches/IO functions are used. Knowing their values tells you which symbols above are relevant for the compiled binary and thus which implementations to inspect for memcmp use.\n\nTogether, inspecting these symbols (definitions/implementations) lets the next analyst determine whether any memcmp use on null-terminated strings occurs directly in the target function, via macro expansions, or transitively via functions it calls."
