  "explanation": "List and reasons (concise):\n- pread64: file_reader calls pread64 in one compilation branch. You must inspect its implementation (or wrapper) to determine whether it can call back to file_reader (indirect recursion).\n- pread: file_reader calls pread in another branch. Its body/wrapper must be checked for possible callbacks to file_reader.\n- lseek64: file_reader may call lseek64 before read when pread is not present; check whether it calls back.\n- lseek: likewise, file_reader may call lseek; inspect its implementation for indirect calls.\n- read: file_reader calls read after seeking in the non-pread branch; read's implementation/wrappers could potentially call back.\n- ReadFile: on Windows branch file_reader calls ReadFile; need its definition/wrapper to see if it can invoke file_reader.\n- _get_osfhandle: on Windows file_reader calls this to obtain a HANDLE; include it because its implementation might call into application code that could lead to file_reader.\n- struct MHD_Response: the function uses response->fd and response->fd_off; the struct definition must be checked to ensure no function-pointer members (or other indirections) exist that could cause indirect calls back to file_reader.\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: these target macros determine which platform branch is compiled; you must know which branch is active to know which call targets are present in the compiled call graph.\n- HAVE_PREAD64, HAVE_PREAD, HAVE_LSEEK64: these feature-test macros select which POSIX APIs are used; their values determine which calls (pread64/pread/lseek64/lseek/read) appear in the compiled code and therefore which call-edges must be inspected for recursion.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine the actual call targets emitted by file_reader and to inspect those targets (and struct-level indirections) for any path that leads back to file_reader, which is what MISRA's \"no recursion\" rule requires."
