  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No code fragments in file_reader exhibit direct or indirect calls to file_reader. The function contains only calls to standard/system I/O functions (pread64, pread, lseek64, lseek, read, ReadFile) and does not invoke any function pointers or callbacks inside this body. The struct MHD_Response shown has a MHD_ContentReaderCallback field, but file_reader does not call that callback here, so there is no indirect recursion via a callback. file_reader is static and there are no occurrences of file_reader being called from within itself in the provided code. Therefore no fragments require investigation for Rule 17.2 (no self-calls)."
