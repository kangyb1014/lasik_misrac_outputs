  "explanation": "Other control expressions in the supplied code do not appear to be invariant: the various if conditions depend on runtime values (md->extra_in_size, recv() return value 'got', send() return 'ret', errno, fcntl/ioctlsocket results, etc.). Preprocessor conditionals are compile-time and not relevant to runtime invariant controlling expressions. The remaining loops and conditionals (apart from the two fragments listed above) evaluate based on data obtained at runtime, so they do not constitute invariant controlling expressions under MISRA C Rule 14.3 and do not need investigation for this rule."
