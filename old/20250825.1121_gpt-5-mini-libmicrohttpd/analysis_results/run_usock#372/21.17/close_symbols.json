  "explanation": "You must inspect the implementations/definitions of the listed symbols to determine whether any string.h functions are used in a way that can access past buffer bounds reachable from run_usock. Rationale for each symbol:\n\n- send_all: run_usock passes both md->extra_in/size and local buffer 'buf' + a size to send_all. If send_all uses memcpy/memmove/strlen/strcpy/etc. incorrectly (e.g. uses strlen instead of the provided length, or copies more bytes than passed), that would violate the MISRA <string.h> rule. The exact implementation of send_all is required to check how it treats the pointer and length parameters.\n\n- make_blocking: send_all calls make_blocking (per static graph). Inspect make_blocking to confirm it does not itself use string.h functions on buffers related to md->extra_in or buf; knowing its behavior also helps understand side effects on socket state but mainly to cover transitive calls.\n\n- struct MyData (definition and all initialization sites that assign extra_in and extra_in_size): you need the type layout to know the exact types of extra_in and extra_in_size, and \u2014 critically \u2014 you must inspect where extra_in is allocated/populated and how extra_in_size is set to ensure md->extra_in_size does not exceed the actual allocation of md->extra_in. An out-of-bounds access could come from misuse of extra_in_size or from callers that set it incorrectly.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action and MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: run_usock calls MHD_upgrade_action at the end; MHD_upgrade_action (and the function it calls) must be checked for any use of string.h functions that might take pointers originating from md or 'buf'. Include MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_ because it is a callee and could contain string.h usage.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (definition): to know whether MHD_upgrade_action receives or manipulates any buffers or pointers that might alias md->extra_in or other buffers; also to see if any string.h functions are applied to fields of this structure.\n\n- recv (prototype/semantics used): run_usock reads into local char buf[128] using recv and then forwards the explicit byte count (got) to send_all. Confirm how recv is expected to behave (return value semantics and maximum bytes read) so you can reason about whether the code can overflow buf or whether send_all might be handed a larger length than the buffer holds.\n\n- ws_send_frame and ws_receive_frame: they appear as callees in the static call graph and ws_send_frame calls send_all. Inspect these transitive callees in case they are actually reachable in other paths or share helper code with send_all that uses string.h functions (e.g. copying or zeroing frames). If they use string.h functions on buffers coming from run_usock or shared buffers, they must be checked.\n\nIn short: to determine MISRA compliance you must examine any function that receives pointer+length values from run_usock (send_all primarily), any code that initializes those buffers/lengths (MyData allocation sites), and any transitive callees that may use standard string functions on those buffers. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to perform that analysis."
