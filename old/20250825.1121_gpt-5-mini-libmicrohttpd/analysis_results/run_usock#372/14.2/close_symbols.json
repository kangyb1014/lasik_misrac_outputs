The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect every function called (directly or indirectly) from run_usock and the data structures passed into it because MISRA's for-loop well-formedness rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the for-loop body. Concretely:\n\n- make_blocking: needed to see whether it contains any for-loops (or calls that do) that could violate the rule or that modify objects used as loop counters elsewhere.\n\n- send_all: run_usock calls send_all several times; send_all (and its implementation) must be examined for any for-loops, loop counters, or modifications to objects that might be used in any for loop in the calling context.\n\n- ws_send_frame: appears in the static call graph as another caller of send_all; its implementation may contain for-loops or shared loop counters/flags that interact with run_usock callees \u2014 inspect for potential violations.\n\n- ws_receive_frame: included in the call graph from run_usock; inspect its body for for-loops or side effects that could affect for-loop well-formedness when invoked inside run_usock.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: called at the end of run_usock; inspect it for for-loops or for modifications of objects that could be loop counters in other for-loops that run concurrently or inlined analyses.\n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: listed as a callee of MHD_upgrade_action in the call graph; include it because it may contain for-loops or modify shared objects relevant to loop analysis.\n\n- struct MyData: the definition (members and types) is required so you know what md->extra_in_size, md->extra_in, md->sock and md->urh are (types, signedness, aliases). If any called function uses or modifies these members inside a for-loop, you must know their types and aliasing.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: the type of urh must be known because MHD_upgrade_action (or its callees) might modify fields or use global state in for-loops that affect conformance.\n\n- (any) global or static objects referenced/modified by send_all, ws_send_frame, ws_receive_frame, MHD_upgrade_action: MISRA's rule forbids use of objects other than the loop counter in the for-clause if those objects are modified in the loop body. If any of the above functions reference or modify global/static objects that could be used as loop counters elsewhere (or are used in for loop conditions), those symbols must be provided so the analyser can determine whether a for-loop is well-formed.\n\nNote: run_usock itself contains no for statement (it uses while). The above symbols are necessary to confirm that no for-loops in called code (or their side effects) produce a violation when considering the total behaviour of any for statements reachable from run_usock."
