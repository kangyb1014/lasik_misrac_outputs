  "explanation": "I did not find direct uses of known compiler language extensions in the provided code (no __attribute__, __declspec, inline asm, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, GNU labels, or other vendor-specific language tokens). The rest of the code uses standard C constructs and platform APIs (POSIX/Win32 socket calls and standard preprocessor conditionals), which are not language extensions per se. \n\nI flagged only the _MHD_EXTERN function declaration because _MHD_EXTERN is a macro that commonly expands to platform/compiler-specific storage-class or attribute specifiers (for example, __declspec(dllexport/dllimport) on MSVC or __attribute__((visibility(...))) on GCC/Clang). Those expansions would constitute language/compiler extensions if present. Since the macro definition is not shown here, this declaration should be investigated to confirm that _MHD_EXTERN does not expand to a compiler-specific extension. \n\nNo other fragments require investigation for Rule 1.2 based on the visible source: varargs (\"...\") are standard C, preprocessor conditionals are standard, POSIX/Win32 API usage is platform API rather than a language extension, and common identifiers (true/false, ssize_t, size_t, etc.) are standard or standard library types/macros. If any other macros (e.g., MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_, mhd_assert, MHD_socket typedef) expand to compiler-specific extension tokens, their definitions should be checked as well, but their usages in the shown code do not by themselves demonstrate use of language extensions."
