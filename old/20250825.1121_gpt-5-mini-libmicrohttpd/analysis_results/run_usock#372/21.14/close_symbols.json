  "explanation": "To determine whether run_usock causes or participates in a violation of the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must examine any code it invokes and the data it passes to those calls. Reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- send_all: run_usock passes buffers (md->extra_in and the recv buffer) to send_all. If send_all or its callees use memcmp to compare those buffers as null-terminated strings, that would constitute a violation. Provide the full definition of send_all to inspect any memcmp usage and how the buffer argument is interpreted.\n\n- make_blocking: called before I/O and also called by send_all (per call graph). If make_blocking contains any string-comparison logic (unlikely but possible via helpers), include it. Also included because send_all calls it.\n\n- ws_receive_frame: listed as a callee in the static graph; include its definition because it may be invoked from run_usock variants or share helpers that perform memcmp on frame payloads interpreted as strings.\n\n- ws_send_frame: listed as a callee and itself calls send_all. Its implementation must be inspected for any memcmp usage on null-terminated websocket payloads or string framing logic.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: called at the end of run_usock; its implementation (or the library it forwards to) could use memcmp on strings when handling upgrade actions. Include it to be sure no prohibited memcmp usage occurs in the upgrade completion path.\n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: MHD_upgrade_action calls this symbol per the graph. Include its definition because it is the downstream code actually executed by MHD_upgrade_action and may contain memcmp uses.\n\n- struct MyData: run_usock inspects members of this struct (urh, sock, extra_in, extra_in_size). You need its definition to know the type/format of extra_in (pointer-to-char, length-only buffer, NUL-terminated string?), ownership/alloc semantics, and whether the data passed to callees is intended as a C string. If extra_in is a NUL-terminated string, any memcmp on it would be suspect.\n\n- struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: include its definition to see whether any fields are strings or lead to callers that might compare strings with memcmp.\n\n- md->extra_in (type/ownership/format): explicitly request the exact type and documented format of extra_in and extra_in_size. The MISRA rule only matters if memcmp is used to compare NUL-terminated strings; if extra_in is a raw length-counted binary buffer then memcmp use may be acceptable. Knowing whether the data is a C string is essential.\n\n- Any helper/static functions called from send_all, ws_send_frame, ws_receive_frame that perform string comparisons (e.g. memcmp wrappers): the callee graph is shallow; to be safe, include any helper functions those implementations call which might perform memcmp or otherwise compare strings so they can be inspected for prohibited usage.\n\nProviding the source/definitions for these symbols lets the analyzer detect any usage of memcmp where the operand(s) are documented or used as NUL-terminated C strings, which is the exact condition the MISRA rule forbids."
