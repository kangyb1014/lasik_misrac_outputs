  "explanation": "To prove whether run_usock violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls we must examine every function it calls (and their callees) to see if any path returns to run_usock. Each listed symbol is required for that reachability check:\n\n- make_blocking: Called directly by run_usock and by send_all; we must inspect it to see if it (now or in the future) calls run_usock (directly or via other functions).\n- send_all: Called multiple times by run_usock; send_all may call other functions (already known to call make_blocking) and could potentially call back into run_usock, so its body/callees must be examined.\n- MHD_upgrade_action: Called at the end of run_usock; we must inspect it to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call run_usock.\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: Known callee of MHD_upgrade_action (from the static graph); include it so its body can be checked for any path back to run_usock.\n- ws_receive_frame: Listed as a callee in the static graph for run_usock; include to verify it does not call run_usock.\n- ws_send_frame: Listed as a callee in the static graph and itself calls send_all; include to check for any indirect path back to run_usock.\n\nIf any of these functions call additional functions (not listed), those additional functions would in turn need to be examined; the above list covers the immediate call closure shown in the provided static call graph so the next agent can start a complete recursion/reachability analysis."
