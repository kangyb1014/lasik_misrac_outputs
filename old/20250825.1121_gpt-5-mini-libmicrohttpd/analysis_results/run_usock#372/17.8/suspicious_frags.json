  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter variable 'cls'. The code only reads 'cls' (struct MyData *md = cls;) and then operates on the object pointed to by that pointer via the local variable md (calls like make_blocking(md->sock), send_all(..., md->extra_in, ...), free(md->extra_in), free(md)). Rule 17.8 allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter but forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself; there are no assignments to or mutations of the parameter variable 'cls' in run_usock. Therefore no fragments need further investigation under Rule 17.8."
