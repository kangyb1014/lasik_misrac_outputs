  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "md->extra_in is declared as char * but is used only as a read-only buffer (passed to send_all and then freed) and is not modified in run_usock. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. const char *extra_in). Thus, declaring extra_in as char * instead of const char * is a violation. (If other code legitimately modifies the buffer, making it non-const would be necessary and no violation would occur.)"
