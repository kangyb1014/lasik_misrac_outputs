  "scenario": "The pointer extra_in is declared as 'char *extra_in' but in run_usock it is only used as a read-only buffer (passed to send_all and then freed); its pointee is not modified through this pointer. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, this should be a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const char *extra_in') where possible. Therefore the current declaration violates the rule. Note: changing to 'const char *' would require handling the subsequent free() (which expects void *) appropriately (e.g. maintain a non-const owning pointer or cast explicitly at the free site), to preserve correct ownership semantics without discarding qualifiers elsewhere."
