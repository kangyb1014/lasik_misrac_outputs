  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to judge const-qualification per MISRA C:\n\n- struct MyData\n  - Contains the declarations of md->extra_in, md->extra_in_size, md->urh and md->sock. To decide whether any pointer fields should be const-qualified (for example extra_in or urh), we must know their declared types here.\n\n- send_all (prototype)\n  - The const-qualification of its buffer parameter determines whether passing md->extra_in and buf is compatible and whether send_all itself should accept a const pointer. If send_all currently takes a non-const pointer but does not modify the data, it may be the locus of a MISRA violation; conversely, if it already takes a const void*, that affects whether run_usock needs to change pointer types.\n\n- make_blocking (prototype)\n  - Needed to know the parameter type for md->sock (e.g. int vs pointer); if make_blocking takes a pointer it may inform whether md->sock should be a pointer type and whether that pointer could/should be const-qualified.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action (prototype)\n  - The const-qualification of its MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle parameter determines whether md->urh should be a pointer-to-const. To evaluate whether run_usock violates MISRA, we must know whether the called API promises not to modify the handle.\n\n- MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (type)\n  - The underlying type (opaque struct or pointer) and how it is intended to be used affect whether pointers to it should be const-qualified.\n\n- recv (prototype)\n  - Confirms that the buffer parameter is non-const (recv takes void*), and so passing buf (a mutable array) is appropriate. This helps rule out/identify potential const-related issues for the local buffer.\n\n- ws_send_frame (prototype)\n  - It is another caller of send_all (from the static call graph). Its prototype and usage of send_all can provide additional evidence about whether send_all treats its buffer as const (i.e., whether other callers treat buffers as const), which helps decide whether pointer types in run_usock should be const-qualified.\n\n(Other standard symbols like free, ssize_t and size_t are standard and not required beyond normal headers; the items above are the additional symbols needed to determine whether pointers used in run_usock should be const-qualified under MISRA C.)"
