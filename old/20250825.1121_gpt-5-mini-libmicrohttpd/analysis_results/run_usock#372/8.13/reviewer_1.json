According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. const char *extra_in). Thus, declaring extra_in as char * instead of const char * is a violation. (If other code legitimately modifies the buffer, making it non-const would be necessary and no violation would occur.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function run_usock:\nstruct MyData\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh;\n  char *extra_in;\n  size_t extra_in_size;\n  MHD_socket sock;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s observation is reasonable but not provable from the snippets alone. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 indeed advises that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type when it is not used to modify the pointee. In run_usock the md->extra_in buffer is only read (passed to send_all) and then freed, so within this function the pointer could be treated as pointing to const data. However, the rule must be assessed against all uses of that declaration across the program. The provided code shows struct MyData declares extra_in as char *, but there is no evidence whether other code modifies the buffer (or whether the API that allocates/initializes extra_in requires a non-const pointer). Also note that free expects a void *; declaring extra_in as const char * would require an explicit cast when calling free, which is a separate consideration.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, you cannot definitively conclude a MISRA 8.13 violation. The report is plausible (if extra_in is never modified anywhere, it should be const), but it is not conclusively correct given the missing wider-context information."
