According to Rule 8.13 the pointer should be const-qualified when possible (e.g. const char *extra_in). The use of a non-const char * here therefore violates Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function run_usock:\nstruct MyData\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh;\n  char *extra_in;\n  size_t extra_in_size;\n  MHD_socket sock;\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is a guideline that a pointer type should be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. To decide whether a violation exists you must know the intended use of the pointer across the whole program, not just in the single function shown. In the snippet run_usock the extra_in buffer is only read and then freed, so in isolation it could be considered a candidate for const qualification. However: (1) the struct member is declared in another translation unit and may be modified elsewhere \u2014 if any other code writes through md->extra_in then it must remain non-const; (2) changing the member to const char * would interact with other APIs (for example free expects void * and passing const char * to free would require a cast, and other functions that take a non-const char * parameter would require changes/casts); (3) MISRA compliance requires whole-program analysis and consideration of other rules (casts that discard const may introduce other violations). Because you have not shown that md->extra_in is never modified anywhere, nor the prototypes of send_all/free/use-sites, you cannot conclude a definite violation. Therefore agent A\u2019s claim is not proven correct on the provided evidence \u2014 at best this is a code-quality suggestion, not a definite MISRA 8.13 violation."
