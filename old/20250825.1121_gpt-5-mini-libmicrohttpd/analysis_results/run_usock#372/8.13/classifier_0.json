  "scenario": "The call MHD_upgrade_action(urh, MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE) itself does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should point to const-qualified types when possible. This fragment only passes an existing pointer variable (urh) to a function; whether urh should be const depends on the function prototype and whether the pointee is modified. With no prototype shown, we cannot conclude it must be const. If MHD_upgrade_action does not modify the pointed object and its prototype could accept a pointer-to-const, then the declarations (md->urh and the local urh) should be changed to const struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle * to satisfy Rule 8.13. As written, there is no definite violation based on the fragment provided."
