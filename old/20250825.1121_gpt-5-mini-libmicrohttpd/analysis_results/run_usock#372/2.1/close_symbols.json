  "explanation": "- struct MyData: needed to know the types and semantics of md->sock, md->extra_in_size and md->extra_in and md->urh (e.g. whether extra_in_size can be statically constant, whether urh aliases md memory) so we can tell if the conditional and subsequent code are ever reachable and whether free(md) affects later uses.  \n- MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: definition is required to know whether storing urh before free(md) keeps a valid handle or whether urh is derived from md (affects reachability/safety of code after free).  \n- make_blocking: its implementation/contract is required to determine whether it can fail, block forever, longjmp or terminate the thread (i.e. whether control may not return, which would make later code effectively unreachable).  \n- send_all: we must know whether send_all can return normally or whether it may exit/longjmp/block forever; that affects whether later statements (including loop iterations and the post-loop code) can be reached.  \n- recv: the exact implementation/wrapper used (or any shadowing of POSIX recv) is required to know the possible return values and side effects that govern loop termination; if recv is guaranteed never to return <=0 then the break and subsequent code could be unreachable.  \n- MHD_upgrade_action and MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE: needed to know whether this call returns normally or could transfer control elsewhere (e.g. not return, longjmp, terminate), and to understand the semantic of the upgrade action used here.  \n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: since MHD_upgrade_action calls it (per the call graph), we need its behavior to determine whether control returns.  \n- ws_receive_frame and ws_send_frame: appear in the static call graph as callees of run_usock; obtain their definitions to understand whether there are conditional/indirect calls (macros, inlined variants or function-pointer uses) that make portions of run_usock reachable or not.  \n- all callers / references to run_usock (including thread-start sites and function-pointer assignments): crucial to determine whether run_usock itself is ever invoked; if there are no possible call sites, the entire function is unreachable (a direct violation of the MISRA rule).  \n\nProviding these symbols/definitions lets the analyzer determine whether any branch, the while loop body, or the post-loop code can never be executed under any valid program semantics (i.e. whether there is truly unreachable code)."
