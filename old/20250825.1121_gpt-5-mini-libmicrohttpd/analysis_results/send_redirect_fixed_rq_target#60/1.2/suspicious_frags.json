  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the presented function body. I checked for common vendor/GCC/clang-specific extensions and constructs that are typically documented as extensions (and would therefore trigger Rule 1.2):\n\n- No use of __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_* functions, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, case-range labels, or other GCC/clang-specific tokens.\n- No use of Microsoft extensions (e.g. __stdcall, __declspec), no assembler blocks, no inline assembler, no nonstandard keywords.\n- No use of compound literals, variable-length arrays, or other constructs that would be extensions beyond standard ISO C in most compilers (the code uses only standard types and literals such as 0x0B/0x0C, standard case labels, and normal string literal concatenation).\n- Preprocessor line-continuation (backslashes) and adjacent string literal concatenation are standard C features, not compiler extensions.\n\nNote: several identifiers in the snippet are macros or external symbols (mhd_assert, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION, _, transmit_error_response_header, connection_close_error, etc.). If any of those macros or functions expand to or use compiler-specific extensions (for example, use __attribute__ or builtin intrinsics), that would be a Rule 1.2 violation \u2014 but such expansions are not visible in this function body. Therefore, based on the code shown here, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 1.2. If you want, I can inspect the definitions of those macros/externals to ensure they do not hide extensions."
