  "explanation": "I have identified as suspicious: all mhd_assert calls and the handling of certain control characters (VT/FF) and the dynamic allocation/copying of hdr_name. These fragments deserve investigation because they may represent operations that are effectively redundant in some build/configurations (e.g. assertions compiled out) or handle characters/comments that the parser may already reject/replace \u2014 both situations can lead to code that is executed but whose removal would not change program behaviour (potential dead code per MISRA Rule 2.2).\n\nWhy other fragments are NOT included: \n- The allocation and use of buffer 'b' (fixed_uri_len calculation, malloc(b), the main do/while loop that percent-encodes characters, b[o] = 0, free(b) on error) are functional core logic required to transform the request target and cannot be removed without changing behaviour. \n- The checks that guard allocation failure and the corresponding error-handling calls (connection_close_error, transmit_error_response_header) are necessary to preserve correct error behaviour on OOM and must remain. \n- The cases for space and tab, and the default branch that copies characters, perform the essential percent-encoding and are active functionality, not dead code. \n- The initial size checks (pool_size, MHD_MAX_FIXED_URI_LEN) and the corresponding early-return error path are reachable and affect behaviour when limits are exceeded. \n\nNote: I did not mark every single line; I focused on the constructs most likely to be candidates for dead code (asserts and handling of characters/alloc paths that may be precluded by earlier parsing). Please investigate the listed fragments to determine whether they are actually redundant in the project configuration(s) in use."
