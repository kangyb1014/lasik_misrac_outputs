The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of send_redirect_fixed_rq_target:\n```c\nstatic void\nsend_redirect_fixed_rq_target (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  char *b;\n  size_t fixed_uri_len;\n  size_t i;\n  size_t o;\n  char *hdr_name;\n  size_t hdr_name_len;\n\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state);\n  mhd_assert (0 != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri);\n  mhd_assert (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri <= \\\n              c->rq.req_target_len);\n  fixed_uri_len = c->rq.req_target_len\n                  + 2 * c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri;\n  if ( (fixed_uri_len + 200 > c->daemon->pool_size) ||\n       (fixed_uri_len > MHD_MAX_FIXED_URI_LEN) ||\n       (NULL == (b = malloc (fixed_uri_len + 1))) )\n  {\n    connection_close_error (c,\n                            _ (\"The request has whitespace character is \" \\\n                               \"in the URI and the URI is too large to \" \\\n                               \"send automatic redirect to fixed URI.\\n\"));\n    return;\n  }\n  i = 0;\n  o = 0;\n\n  do\n  {\n    const char chr = c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt[i++];\n\n    mhd_assert ('\\r' != chr); /* Replaced during request line parsing */\n    mhd_assert ('\\n' != chr); /* Rejected during request line parsing */\n    mhd_assert (0 != chr); /* Rejected during request line parsing */\n    switch (chr)\n    {\n    case ' ':\n      b[o++] = '%';\n      b[o++] = '2';\n      b[o++] = '0';\n      break;\n    case '\\t':\n      b[o++] = '%';\n      b[o++] = '0';\n      b[o++] = '9';\n      break;\n    case 0x0B:   /* VT (vertical tab) */\n      b[o++] = '%';\n      b[o++] = '0';\n      b[o++] = 'B';\n      break;\n    case 0x0C:   /* FF (form feed) */\n      b[o++] = '%';\n      b[o++] = '0';\n      b[o++] = 'C';\n      break;\n    default:\n      b[o++] = chr;\n      break;\n    }\n  } while (i < c->rq.req_target_len);\n  mhd_assert (fixed_uri_len == o);\n  b[o] = 0; /* Zero-terminate the result */\n\n  hdr_name_len = MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION);\n  hdr_name = malloc (hdr_name_len + 1);\n  if (NULL != hdr_name)\n  {\n    memcpy (hdr_name,\n            MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION,\n            hdr_name_len + 1);\n    /* hdr_name and b are free()d within this call */\n    transmit_error_response_header (c,\n                                    MHD_HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY,\n                                    RQ_TARGET_INVALID_CHAR,\n                                    hdr_name,\n                                    hdr_name_len,\n                                    b,\n                                    o);\n    return;\n  }\n  free (b);\n  connection_close_error (c,\n                          _ (\"The request has whitespace character is in the \" \\\n                             \"URI.\\n\"));\n  return;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (0 != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No. The mhd_assert call is a diagnostic/runtime check (like assert) and is not dead code: when enabled it can change control flow (e.g. abort/report) so removing it would change program behaviour in fault cases; when disabled it is compiled out by the macro and therefore not executed. To remain MISRA-compliant ensure the assert macro has no hidden side\u2011effects (expressions in asserts must not have side\u2011effects), otherwise the removal could hide behaviour and lead to a Rule 2.2 violation."
