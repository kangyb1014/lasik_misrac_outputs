  "explanation": "I inspected all pointer uses and declarations in the function. I did not report b or hdr_name variable declarations (char *b; char *hdr_name;) because those buffers are written to and freed within this code path (they must be modifiable), so they cannot/should not be const-qualified here. The connection pointer parameter (struct MHD_Connection *c) is passed to helper functions that modify connection state (e.g. connection_close_error, transmit_error_response_header, MHD_connection_close_), so it also should not be const. String literals passed to connection_close_error are already passed to a function taking const char * and are therefore appropriate. The two reported fragments are read-only uses of data: the indexed access into c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt only reads characters, and the memcpy source MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION is a static string. These are places where the pointed-to types might be eligible for const qualification and therefore warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
