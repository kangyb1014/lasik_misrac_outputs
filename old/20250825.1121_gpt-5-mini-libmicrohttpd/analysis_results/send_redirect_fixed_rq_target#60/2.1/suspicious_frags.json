  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not require investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1 because they are simple, conditional, and reachable based on runtime values: - The switch contains a default branch and explicit cases for all intended whitespace byte values, so those statements are not statically unreachable. - The malloc() of b and its subsequent use are guarded by a null check; both success and failure paths contain returns so there is no code permanently after an unconditional return in the same execution path. - mhd_assert is defined here as ((void)0), so none of the assert statements introduce control-flow (no compile-time never-taken branches are present elsewhere). - The remaining linear statements (assignments, length computations, zero-termination b[o]=0) are reachable in at least one execution path depending on inputs and allocation results. Therefore only the listed fragments merit further inspection with respect to possible unreachable-code issues (for example: assumptions enforced only by mhd_assert, the do-while that always executes once, and the hdr_name allocation/return path which may make the alternate path the only reachable one in some builds)."
