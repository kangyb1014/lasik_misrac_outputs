  "explanation": "For checking whether any statement in send_redirect_fixed_rq_target is unreachable we must know all compile-time and run-time facts that can make branches impossible or functions non-returning. Each listed symbol is required for that reasoning:\n\n- mhd_assert: needed to know whether assert checks compile to no-ops (making some checks non-binding) or abort/terminate the program on failure. This affects whether code guarded only by assertions can be considered unreachable.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition and field types): the function indexes many members of c; the exact layout and types (e.g. integral widths, signed/unsigned) can influence value ranges and therefore reachability of branches.\n\n- struct for request fields (c->rq.*, hdrs.rq_line.num_ws_in_uri, hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt, req_target_len): these specific fields determine the values used in computations (fixed_uri_len, loop bound i < req_target_len, and the content read). Knowing their types/semantic invariants (e.g. req_target_len never zero, num_ws_in_uri bounded) is necessary to decide if certain paths/loops are actually possible.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon / c->daemon->pool_size: the pool_size value is compared against fixed_uri_len + 200; the possible domain of pool_size affects whether the first if-condition can ever be true or false and thus whether the connection_close_error branch is reachable.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING: the asserted state; needs definition to know whether the initial mhd_assert can be assumed true/false in normal builds and whether it implies other invariants.\n\n- MHD_MAX_FIXED_URI_LEN: the compile-time limit used in the second part of the if-condition; knowing its value (or range) is required to decide whether that branch can be taken for any legitimate req_target_len (hence whether the error branch is reachable).\n\n- malloc: the code branches on malloc returning NULL or non-NULL (for b and hdr_name). To determine reachability of the NULL branch we must know whether malloc can fail in the target environment or if the project assumes a non-failing allocator (or if wrappers exist). Also necessary to reason about sizes passed to malloc.\n\n- free: to reason about resource handling and whether paths are reachable without leaks; less critical for reachability itself but needed to verify the comment that some buffers are freed in called functions.\n\n- memcpy: used to copy the static header name; knowing its behavior and that hdr_name_len+1 is valid ensures the allocation and copy are well-formed and the hdr_name-success branch is feasible.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (macro): this yields hdr_name_len. The expansion (whether it yields the expected length excluding or including NUL) matters to know what size is allocated and copied, affecting whether the hdr_name allocation/copy branch is reachable or would overflow/UB making code effectively unreachable in correct builds.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION: the static header string used to compute hdr_name_len and copy; needed to compute hdr_name_len and reason about the malloc request and subsequent branch.\n\n- transmit_error_response_header (function signature and behavioral contract): the function is called in the hdr_name-success branch and the comment says hdr_name and b are free()d within it. To decide whether the return statement after the call is reachable or redundant (and therefore whether subsequent code is unreachable), we must know whether this function ever returns normally or can longjmp/exit/terminate the connection. Also its side-effects matter to overall control-flow and whether following code could be executed (even though this function returns immediately after the call in the source, its behavior might affect compiler analysis of reachability).\n\n- connection_close_error (function signature and behavioral contract): called in multiple error branches; if this function never returns (e.g. calls exit/longjmp/terminate connection and aborts), then any code following calls to it could be considered unreachable. Knowing its semantics is necessary to mark code reachable or not.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY and RQ_TARGET_INVALID_CHAR: constants passed to transmit_error_response_header; while they do not affect control-flow directly, their definitions may be macros that expand to calls or expressions with side-effects (unlikely but possible). Include them to ensure there are no hidden control-flow effects that would make branches unreachable.\n\nIn summary: to determine if any of the function's statements are statically or effectively unreachable (per MISRA), the next analyzer needs the definitions/semantics of the above macros, constants, structure fields and the behavioral contracts of the called functions (especially whether they can fail, return or terminate)."
