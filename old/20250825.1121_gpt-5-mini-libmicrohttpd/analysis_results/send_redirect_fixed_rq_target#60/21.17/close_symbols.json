This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For a correct MISRA C analysis of memcpy and other string/byte operations in send_redirect_fixed_rq_target you must know the exact types, sizes and semantics of the objects and macros used in that function. Each listed symbol is required for the reasons below:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function indexes into members of the connection (c). You need the full definition to confirm types, pointer layout and that accesses like c->rq and c->daemon are valid and of the expected types.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (daemon->pool_size): The code checks fixed_uri_len + 200 > c->daemon->pool_size. To reason about integer arithmetic, overflows and whether that check prevents out-of-bounds allocations/writes you need the type and meaning of pool_size (usually size_t) and possible value ranges.\n\n- c->rq (request) and c->rq.hdrs.rq_line (num_ws_in_uri, rq_tgt): The loop reads c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt[i] and uses num_ws_in_uri to compute fixed_uri_len. You must know the pointer type of rq_tgt, its valid length, and semantics of num_ws_in_uri to ensure indexing i is within the underlying buffer and that the computed fixed_uri_len accurately bounds the encoded output.\n\n- c->rq.req_target_len: The loop termination and the computation of fixed_uri_len depend on this length. You must know its type and semantics (does it include NUL, does it represent bytes) to verify the o index and final b[o]=0 write are within the allocated buffer.\n\n- MHD_MAX_FIXED_URI_LEN: The code checks fixed_uri_len > MHD_MAX_FIXED_URI_LEN; you need this value to conclude whether the check prevents oversized allocations and thereby prevents out-of-bounds memcpy/memory writes.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: The macro is used to compute hdr_name_len from MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION. To ensure the subsequent malloc(hdr_name_len + 1) and memcpy(..., hdr_name_len + 1) are correct, you must know exactly what the macro returns (e.g. sizeof(lit)-1 vs. strlen(lit)).\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION: The literal/string used as source for memcpy. You must know its actual content/length (and whether it is NUL-terminated) to check the correctness of the size passed to memcpy.\n\n- malloc: The allocation semantics and failure behavior are necessary to reason about whether b and hdr_name have sufficient size and whether NULL returns are handled before any use.\n\n- free: To ensure no double-free or use-after-free issues when transmit_error_response_header claims to free buffers (the code frees b on one path), you need free semantics and to cross-check ownership assumptions.\n\n- memcpy: The MISRA rule targets functions in <string.h>. You must inspect the exact memcpy call site (destination, source, length) and know memcpy semantics (copies exactly that many bytes) to determine if the memcpy can access beyond source or destination bounds.\n\n- transmit_error_response_header: The comment says hdr_name and b are free()d inside that call. To rely on that behavior (and to ensure no further use after free), you need the function prototype/implementation or at least its ownership contract (what it copies, whether it copies hdr_name or uses it directly, and whether it frees the passed buffers). Also verify it does not perform additional copies that could trigger out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- mhd_assert / MHD_ASSERT: The code uses mhd_assert checks to constrain inputs (e.g. c->state and that num_ws_in_uri > 0). For MISRA analysis you must know whether these are runtime checks (and possibly disabled in non-debug builds) so you cannot rely on them for safety; knowing their definition clarifies whether they affect the safety guarantees.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine: (1) whether the computed fixed_uri_len accurately bounds the encoded URI output (so malloc(fixed_uri_len+1) is large enough for all writes including final NUL), (2) whether memcpy(hdr_name, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_LOCATION, hdr_name_len+1) copies the correct number of bytes into hdr_name as allocated, and (3) whether ownership and freeing semantics (transmit_error_response_header / free) do not cause use-after-free or double-free that could mask or create apparent out-of-bounds string.h usages."
