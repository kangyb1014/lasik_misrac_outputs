  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions and declarations referenced by the function: \n\n- tool_params (its type/struct definition and field declarations): the structure/type of tool_params may use compiler extensions (e.g. anonymous structs/unions, non\u2011standard attributes, GCC extension bit\u2011field syntax). The full definition is needed to ensure field access is standard C.\n\n- tool_params.thread_per_conn (field declaration/representation): check whether this field is a plain integer/boolean or declared via an extension (bit\u2011field with compiler\u2011specific widths, macros, or attributes) that would make the access non\u2011standard.\n\n- tool_params.epoll (field declaration/representation): same reason as above \u2014 the field could be declared with extensions that would render usage a language extension.\n\n- num_threads (definition and type and any storage\u2011class/attributes): the variable assigned here might be declared with compiler extensions (e.g. special storage attributes, atomics, register with attributes, or non\u2011standard type aliases). Its definition is needed to confirm the assignment is standard C.\n\n- fprintf (declaration/possible macro definition from <stdio.h>): although fprintf is a standard library function, some projects redefine or wrap stdio functions using macros or compiler extensions; confirm the actual declaration/definition is the standard one and not an extension.\n\n- stderr (declaration/possible macro from <stdio.h>): stderr is typically macro/extern in stdio.h; verify it is provided in a standards\u2011conforming way and not via an extension.\n\n- <stdio.h> (the header providing fprintf/stderr declarations): the actual header used in the translation unit could be a project/local header or a system header that introduces non\u2011standard declarations; examine it to ensure no language extensions are introduced via headers.\n\nOnly by inspecting these symbols/definitions can you conclude whether any compiler\u2011specific or non\u2011standard language extensions are used in or exposed to the target function."
