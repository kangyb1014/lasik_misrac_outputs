  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 applies to controlling expressions of conditionals and loops. The two if-statements above are the only controlling expressions in this function and therefore must be checked to ensure they are not invariant (e.g., due to tool_params.* being constant, macro-expanded, or otherwise unchanging). Other fragments in the function are not controlling expressions and so are not relevant to Rule 14.3: the assignments (num_threads = 1;) and the return expressions (return ! 0; and return 0;) are ordinary expressions/statements but not controlling expressions; string literals and fprintf calls are not controlling expressions either. There are no loops (while/for/do-while) in this function, so loop-specific exceptions do not apply here."
