  "explanation": "- tool_params (declaration/definition): The two controlling expressions use members of this global. You must see the variable declaration/definition to know whether it (or its members) is const-qualified, volatile, or otherwise fixed at compile time.\n\n- type/struct definition of tool_params (complete member declarations, in particular thread_per_conn and epoll): You need the exact member types (int, enum, bool, bit-field) and qualifiers to determine whether the expressions !tool_params.thread_per_conn and tool_params.epoll can vary at runtime or are invariant.\n\n- All assignments/initializations of tool_params.thread_per_conn (locations/functions where it is set): If thread_per_conn is assigned at runtime (e.g. by option parsing or later code), the controlling expression is not invariant. All assignment sites are required to prove non\u2011invariance.\n\n- All assignments/initializations of tool_params.epoll (locations/functions where it is set): Same reason as above for the epoll member used as a controlling expression.\n\n- Any macros or const definitions that give default/compile-time values for thread_per_conn or epoll (e.g. #define/const objects): If either member is implemented as a compile-time constant or defined via macros/const objects, the controlling expression could be invariant; those definitions must be checked.\n\n- definitions of functions that initialize tool_params (e.g. main or command-line/option parser routines): To locate the runtime initialization/assignment paths and confirm whether the members can change before the if tests, the code that builds/initializes tool_params must be inspected.\n\n(Only these symbols are required to decide whether the if-controlling expressions are provably invariant; other symbols in the function such as num_threads or fprintf are irrelevant to the MISRA rule under analysis.)"
