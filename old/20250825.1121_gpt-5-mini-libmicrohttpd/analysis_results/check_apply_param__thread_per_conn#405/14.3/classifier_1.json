  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in typical usage: the controlling expression (!tool_params.thread_per_conn) depends on a (presumably) run\u2011time modifiable member of the tool_params object, so it is not invariant. A violation would occur if thread_per_conn were in fact a compile\u2011time constant or a const object never modified (e.g. #define THREAD_PER_CONN 0 or const int thread_per_conn = 0), which would make the if expression invariant and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
