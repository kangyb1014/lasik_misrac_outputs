  "explanation": "- tool_params (definition and type information, including thread_per_conn and epoll members): The function reads tool_params.thread_per_conn and tool_params.epoll. To be sure the target function does not indirectly invoke any <string.h> functions or perform pointer arithmetic on character arrays, the analyzer needs the exact type of tool_params and the types of these members (e.g. integer, boolean, pointer). If either member were a pointer or an object that triggers calls to string functions via accessors/macros, that could matter for the MISRA string-bounds rule.\\n- num_threads (declaration and type): The function assigns to num_threads. Knowing its type (and whether its assignment triggers any side effects or macros) is necessary to confirm no hidden string-handling operations are performed as part of that assignment.\\n- fprintf (declaration / prototype): The function calls fprintf. Although fprintf is not part of <string.h>, the analyzer should inspect its usage (format string and arguments) to ensure no string.h functions are invoked here or by wrappers/macros around fprintf in this build. Providing the prototype helps detect any project-specific redefinitions.\\n- stderr (declaration / macro, and FILE type): stderr is passed to fprintf; knowing its declaration and whether it is a plain FILE* macro or a project-specific wrapper ensures there are no hidden string operations tied to that macro or its expansion.\\nThese symbols let the next analyst confirm that the target function neither directly calls any <string.h> functions nor invokes them indirectly via the globals or I/O calls used in this function."
