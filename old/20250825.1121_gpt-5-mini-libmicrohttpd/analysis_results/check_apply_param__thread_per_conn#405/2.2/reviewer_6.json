  "explanation": "The claim cannot be confirmed from the snippets shown. MISRA 2.2 concerns executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The assignment num_threads = 1 is executed in check_apply_param__thread_per_conn; whether it is dead depends on whether num_threads is subsequently read and affects the program (for example in init_data(), run_mhd(), thread-creation code, etc.). The additional code you provided shows calls to init_data() and run_mhd() after check_apply_params(), so it is entirely plausible (and likely) that num_threads is used there. Agent A only showed a partial program and did not demonstrate that num_threads is never read anywhere in the translation unit or project. Therefore the evidence given is insufficient to conclude the assignment is dead code. To prove a MISRA 2.2 violation you must show that no executed code ever reads num_threads (whole-project analysis / grep for reads, or inspect the functions called later). If such a search finds no reads, then the report would be correct; as presented, the report is not correct."
