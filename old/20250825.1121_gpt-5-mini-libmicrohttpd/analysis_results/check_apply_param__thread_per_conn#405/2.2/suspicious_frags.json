  "explanation": "I have flagged all code fragments that could plausibly hide dead operations or that have unusual/obscure effects and therefore deserve closer inspection: the early conditional return, the epoll error branch, the assignment to the global num_threads, the uses of the expression \"! 0\" as return values, the global tool_params initializer, the global num_threads declaration, and the call site that treats the function's boolean-like return value as an error indicator. Other parts of the provided code do not appear to be dead code and thus do not need investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.2 based on the snippets shown: the overall check_apply_params() control flow calls various parameter-check functions in sequence (help/version handling, parameter checks and application, error returns) which are reachable and affect program behaviour; main()'s processing of return codes from process_params(), check_apply_params(), init_data(), run_mhd(), and deinit_data() is standard and each call's return value is used to decide program flow; the presence of show_help(), print_version(), and the error-return pattern (returning specific error codes or -1 for help/version) indicates those branches are purposeful. With only the supplied code, there is no evidence that these other functions or statements are executed but have no effect \u2014 they influence control flow or program outcome and therefore are not considered dead code here. If you want, I can expand the investigation by inspecting definitions/bodies of the other check_*/init/run functions to determine whether any of the flagged fragments are genuinely redundant (dead) in the full program context."
