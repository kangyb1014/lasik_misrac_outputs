First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements (their three clauses, loop counter usage and side effects). The provided target function and the shown related definitions contain no for statements at all: \n- check_apply_param__thread_per_conn contains only if statements, returns and a call to fprintf; there is no for loop or loop counter to inspect. \n- The provided initialization of tool_params and the declaration of num_threads likewise show no for statements. \n- The only function call present (fprintf) is not part of any for statement in the shown code, and there is no for-loop body whose behaviour would include called functions.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that are relevant to Rule 14.2. If there are other source files or additional fragments that contain for statements, those would need to be provided to perform a Rule 14.2 review; based solely on the code shown, nothing should be investigated for this rule."
