The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must confirm that no for-loop related behaviour can be hidden via referenced symbols or through side-effects in expressions used in this function. Specifically:\n\n- tool_params: the global/object whose fields are read. Need the symbol to inspect if it is a simple object or a macro/function-like expression that could introduce side-effects (including loops) when accessed.\n- struct tool_params (definition/type): to know the types of the fields (e.g. boolean, integral, bit-field, volatile, or accessor macros) and whether reading those fields could have side-effects or involve function calls or loop constructs.\n- tool_params.thread_per_conn: the exact declaration/type and any accessor macro for this field are required to determine that the first if-condition is a pure read with no hidden side-effects or loop behaviour.\n- tool_params.epoll: same reason as above for the second if-condition \u2014 ensure evaluating this expression cannot invoke code that contains a for loop or modifies loop counters.\n- num_threads: the global/object assigned here \u2014 need its declaration to confirm the assignment is a simple scalar write (not a macro or lvalue with side-effects or a write that triggers code containing loops).\n- fprintf: although not in a for loop here, ensure the fprintf identifier is the standard library function (or a harmless wrapper) and not a macro that could expand into loop constructs affecting MISRA for-loop concerns.\n- stderr: same rationale as fprintf \u2014 verify it is the usual FILE* object or a benign symbol and not a macro/function that could introduce loop behaviour when used.\n\nWith these symbols/definitions you can determine whether any expressions in this function (or their evaluation) introduce for-loops or side-effects that would be relevant to the MISRA \u2018well\u2011formed for loop\u2019 rule. No other callees are present in the static call graph, so no further function bodies need inspection for loop behaviour."
