  "explanation": "To decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule about pointers pointing to const-qualified types we must know which expressions are pointer types and how they are declared:\n\n- tool_params (definition of the global variable and its struct/type): the function accesses tool_params.thread_per_conn and tool_params.epoll. We need the actual declaration of tool_params to determine whether those members are scalar types or pointer types; only pointer members can implicate the \"pointer should point to const-qualified type\" rule.\n\n- thread_per_conn (member declaration/type within tool_params): explicitly state whether this member is a pointer and, if so, to what type so we can check if it should be const-qualified.\n\n- epoll (member declaration/type within tool_params): same reason as thread_per_conn \u2014 verify whether epoll is a pointer and its target type.\n\n- num_threads (declaration and its type): the function assigns to num_threads. If num_threads is a pointer (e.g., int *), that might trigger the const-pointer rule; if it is an integer, it is irrelevant. The declaration disambiguates this.\n\n- fprintf (prototype/declaration from <stdio.h>): the call to fprintf involves pointer parameters (FILE * and const char *). We need the prototype to confirm the const qualification of the format parameter and the type of the stream parameter to determine whether this call or the supplied arguments could violate the MISRA pointer constness rule.\n\n- stderr (declaration from <stdio.h>): stderr is passed to fprintf; its declaration (type FILE *) is needed to see if a non-const FILE * is being used appropriately (FILE objects are typically mutable, so not const) and to ensure no pointer-to-const mismatch exists.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine which identifiers in the function are pointer types and whether their declarations satisfy (or should be changed to satisfy) the MISRA requirement that pointers point to const-qualified types where possible."
