  "explanation": "No pointer objects or pointer assignments appear in the provided function body. The code only reads scalar members (tool_params.thread_per_conn, tool_params.epoll), assigns an integer (num_threads = 1), and calls fprintf with a string literal. The fprintf format argument has type compatible with const char * (no non-const pointer is being stored or modified), and stderr is a FILE* stream (not subject to Rule 8.13). There are no & (address-of) or * (dereference) operations, no pointer parameters or local pointer variables, and no pointer-to-non-const being assigned from pointer-to-const. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
