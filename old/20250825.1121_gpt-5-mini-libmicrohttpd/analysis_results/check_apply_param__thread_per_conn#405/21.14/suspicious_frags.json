  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). Analysis of the provided code:\n- The function check_apply_param__thread_per_conn contains no calls to memcmp (or any other raw memory-compare function). It only evaluates boolean-like fields of tool_params, calls fprintf with string literals, assigns num_threads, and returns integer values.\n- The provided tool_params initializer is a list of numeric zeros \u2014 there are no character arrays or string literals being compared with memcmp.\n- The only string usage is a string literal passed to fprintf, which is not a use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- No other code fragments were provided that reference memcmp or perform memory comparisons of char buffers.\n\nTherefore, based on the supplied code, there are no instances that should be investigated for Rule 21.14. If additional source files or modules exist, they should be scanned for uses of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings (e.g., memcmp(a, b, strlen(a)) or memcmp(a, b, n) where a or b are C-strings); those would be the relevant suspicious cases to report."
