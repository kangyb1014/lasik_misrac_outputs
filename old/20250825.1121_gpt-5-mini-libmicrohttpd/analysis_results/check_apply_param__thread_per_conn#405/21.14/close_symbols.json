  "explanation": "tool_params / tool_params.thread_per_conn / tool_params.epoll: The global configuration object and the specific fields accessed in the function. We need the struct/variable definitions to confirm these are plain data fields (e.g. int/boolean) and not macros, inline accessors, or overridden identifiers that could expand to calls that (directly or indirectly) use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nnum_threads: The global variable assigned in the function. Its declaration/type is needed to ensure the assignment is a simple integer store and not a macro or function-like construct that could hide a memcmp usage.\n\nfprintf: The Standard I/O function used for the error message. We must check if fprintf has been redefined as a macro or wrapper in this codebase that might internally call memcmp on NUL-terminated strings (e.g. custom logging implementation), which would be a MISRA concern.\n\nstderr: The stream object passed to fprintf. Including its declaration ensures there is no unusual macro/aliasing that could map the call to some other function that uses memcmp.\n\n(Reasoning) The MISRA rule in question is specifically about use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The target function itself contains no explicit memcmp usage or string comparisons, so the only way it could violate the rule is if any of the referenced symbols expand to or call code that uses memcmp on NUL-terminated strings. The listed symbols are exactly those that must be inspected to rule out such hidden uses."
