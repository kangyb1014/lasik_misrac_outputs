  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function contains unreachable code under MISRA's 'no unreachable code' rule you must know whether any branches or the whole function can be proven impossible at compile- or analysis-time. Specifically:\n\n- tool_params (structure/variable declaration and definition): the function's behavior depends entirely on this global object. You need its type, storage class (extern/const/volatile), and definition to assess whether its fields are compile-time constant or can change at runtime.\n\n- tool_params.thread_per_conn (field declaration and all assignments/initializers): the first if uses this field to choose an early return. If this field is a compile-time constant (or always initialized to a fixed value and never modified) one branch could be statically unreachable. You need its type (boolean/int/bitfield), initial value, and any assignments to determine reachability of the 'if' true/false paths.\n\n- tool_params.epoll (field declaration and all assignments/initializers): the second conditional depends on this field. To know if the fprintf/return 0 branch is reachable you must know if epoll can be true at runtime or is compile-time fixed. Also if epoll is unreachable when thread_per_conn is set, the fprintf branch would be unreachable.\n\n- num_threads (global variable declaration and all assignments/initializers): the function writes num_threads = 1. To check for unreachable code you need to know whether that assignment is reachable and whether the variable is const/unused/optimised away; also other code may affect its reachability/side effects.\n\n- fprintf and stderr (declaration): the fprintf call is a side-effecting statement. To decide whether it is unreachable you must know that fprintf is available and not a macro that expands to nothing under some build configs (or removed under preprocessing). Knowing the declaration/definition and any conditional compilation around I/O helps decide reachability.\n\n- check_apply_params (caller) and main (caller of check_apply_params): MISRA's rule can consider whole-function reachability (dead functions). To know whether this function is ever invoked you must inspect its callers and the call chain (check_apply_params and main) to confirm the function is actually called in the build.\n\n- Configuration macros or compile-time flags that affect tool_params fields: build-time defines may force tool_params.thread_per_conn or tool_params.epoll to constant values (or remove fprintf via config). Such macros can make code paths statically unreachable; they must be reviewed.\n\nCollectively, these symbols provide the necessary declarations, initial values, assignments, caller information, and build-time configuration needed to decide if any statement or path in check_apply_param__thread_per_conn is provably unreachable under the project's build and analysis model."
