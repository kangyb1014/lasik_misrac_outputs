  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided function. Control-flow paths are as follows: if tool_params.thread_per_conn is false the function returns immediately; if it is true and tool_params.epoll is true the fprintf and the subsequent return are executed; if it is true and tool_params.epoll is false execution reaches the assignment num_threads = 1 and the final return. There are no statements located after an unconditional return that would be statically unreachable. Although the use of the expression \"return ! 0;\" is unusual (it evaluates to 0), that is a semantic oddity, not an instance of unreachable code, so it is not flagged under Rule 2.1."
