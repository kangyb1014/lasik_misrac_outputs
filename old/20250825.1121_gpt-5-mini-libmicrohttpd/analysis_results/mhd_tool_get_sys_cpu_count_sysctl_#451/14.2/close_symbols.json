There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "To decide whether the shown function can violate the MISRA for-loop rule, the next analyst must know which parts of the function are actually compiled and whether any referenced macros/functions expand to or call code that contains or affects for-loop behavior. Brief reasons for each symbol: \n\n- __linux__: Controls the outer #ifndef \u2014 required to determine whether the entire sysctl-based code is compiled at all. If this macro changes, different code (possibly containing loops) may be present. \n\n- HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME: Controls inclusion of the sysctlbyname blocks. Needed to know whether the sysctlbyname calls (and their code paths) are present in the compiled function. \n\n- HAVE_SYSCTL, HAS_DECL_CTL_HW, HAS_DECL_HW_NCPUONLINE, HAS_DECL_HW_AVAILCPU: These feature-test macros control the conditional compilation of the sysctl() MIB-based branches. They determine whether those branches (which reference constants/macros and call sysctl()) are present. Any compiled branch must be inspected for for-loops or interactions with loop counters if the function contained loops. \n\n- sysctlbyname: The identifier could be a function, macro, or inline wrapper. The analyst must inspect its definition/implementation to ensure it does not expand to or call code that would affect for-loop well-formedness (e.g., hidden loop counters, modification of objects used by a surrounding for loop). Under MISRA the behaviour of called functions matters when analysing loop bodies. \n\n- sysctl: Same rationale as sysctlbyname \u2014 need to see whether it is a plain library function, a macro, or an inline wrapper that might include loops or side-effects relevant to loop semantics. \n\n- CTL_HW, HW_NCPUONLINE, HW_AVAILCPU: These macros/constants are used to build the mib[] array. The analyst should inspect their definitions to confirm they are simple integer constants (no side effects or expressions that expand to code with loops or modifying objects). \n\n- size_t: The type used for value_size; need its definition (or standard include) to ensure no surprising macro redefinition that could introduce side effects relevant to loop analysis. \n\n- NULL: Used as an argument in calls; include to ensure it is the usual null pointer macro and not redefined to something with side effects.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no for loops; the above symbols are sufficient to (a) determine which code regions are compiled in, and (b) inspect any called/expanded code (sysctlbyname/sysctl/macros) for hidden loops or modifications that could impact compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule if such code were part of a loop body in this function or in surrounding code. If you prefer, include the headers that define these symbols (e.g., <sys/types.h>, <sys/sysctl.h>) in the next-agent prompt so the implementations/definitions can be located quickly."
