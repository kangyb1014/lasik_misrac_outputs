  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target function MHD_send_init_static_vars_ and the related static function iov_max_init_. Neither function contains calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The code only calls freebsd_sendfile_init_ (whose implementation is not provided) and sysconf, performs integer casts/assignments, and uses preprocessor conditionals. Because no string.h functions are present in the supplied code fragments, there are no candidate fragments that could violate Rule 21.17 to report for investigation. If you provide the implementation of freebsd_sendfile_init_ or any other omitted code (the \u201c...\u201d), I can re-check those for uses of string.h functions that might be suspicious."
