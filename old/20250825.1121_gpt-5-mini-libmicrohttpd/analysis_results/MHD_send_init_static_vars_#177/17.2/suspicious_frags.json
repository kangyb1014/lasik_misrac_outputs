  "explanation": "Other fragments in the supplied code do not need investigation for Rule 17.2: the provided definition of iov_max_init_ only calls sysconf and sets a static variable (no calls to MHD_send_init_static_vars_ or other functions that could create recursion), so it is safe with respect to direct/indirect self-calls. Preprocessor defines and comments do not affect call graphs by themselves. The only potential recursion paths from the target function are via the called functions; therefore the call sites inside the target function were reported so their implementations can be inspected. No other function bodies were provided that call back into MHD_send_init_static_vars_, so no additional fragments were flagged."
