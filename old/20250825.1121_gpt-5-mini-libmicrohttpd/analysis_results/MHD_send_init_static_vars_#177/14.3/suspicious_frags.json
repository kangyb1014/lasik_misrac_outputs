  "explanation": "I examined the body of MHD_send_init_static_vars_. There are no C controlling statements (no if, switch, for, while, do-while, or conditional (?:) operator) whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The only conditionals present are preprocessor directives (#ifdef / #if / #endif), which are resolved at preprocessing time and are not subject to MISRA C Rule 14.3 (which concerns C controlling expressions at runtime). The allowed exceptions for invariant controlling expressions (infinite loops or a do-while with an essentially Boolean constant false) do not apply because no loops are present. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided function that need to be investigated for Rule 14.3."
