The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "iov_max_init_: This function is directly called by MHD_send_init_static_vars_. Any for-loops inside it (or functions it calls) are part of the target function\u2019s effective behaviour per the MISRA text; we must inspect its implementation and any objects (loop counters, flags, globals) it uses to determine compliance. freebsd_sendfile_init_: Although its call is conditional, it appears in the target source; if the relevant macros are defined this callee becomes part of the target\u2019s behaviour. We must inspect it for for-loops and for any objects modified in its body. HAVE_SYSCONF and _SC_IOV_MAX: These preprocessor symbols control whether the call to iov_max_init_ is compiled in. Knowing whether they are defined tells us whether iov_max_init_ is part of the compiled target and therefore whether its loops must be analysed. HAVE_FREEBSD_SENDFILE and SF_FLAGS: These preprocessor symbols control whether freebsd_sendfile_init_ is compiled/called. Their definition state determines whether that function\u2019s loops (if any) must be considered. Note: after obtaining the implementations of the listed functions, also collect any global variables, typedefs or other functions referenced by those implementations (loop counters, loop-control flags, or any objects modified inside loops) because MISRA\u2019s rule requires examining objects used/modified by those for-loops."
