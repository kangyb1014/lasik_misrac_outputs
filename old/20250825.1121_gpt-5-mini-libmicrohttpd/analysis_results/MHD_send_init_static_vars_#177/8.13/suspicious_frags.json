  "explanation": "I found no pointer declarations, pointer parameters, or expressions involving pointer conversions in the provided code fragments. Both functions (MHD_send_init_static_vars_ and iov_max_init_) have no pointer parameters and perform only integer/sysconf and macro-based operations; mhd_iov_max_ is an unsigned long (not a pointer). Preprocessor conditionals and referenced functions (freebsd_sendfile_init_, iov_max_init_) are called by name only and no pointer types are visible in the shown code. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to const-qualified type whenever possible) is not applicable to any fragment present here. If there are other source fragments that contain pointer declarations or pointer-typed globals/parameters (not shown), those should be provided for review."
