  "explanation": "The function contains no runtime control-flow constructs (no returns, branches, loops or code after statements) that would create unreachable statements within the translation unit as written. The only places where code may be present or absent at compile time are the two preprocessor-guarded initialization calls shown above; whether those calls are compiled into the project depends on macro definitions across the build. Preprocessor directives and comments themselves are not runtime statements to be judged for reachability. Therefore the only fragments that merit investigation for potential unreachable code are the guarded initialization blocks (the FreeBSD sendfile block and the iov_max_init_() block). All other lines (function signature, braces, comments, and the preprocessor directives outside these blocks) do not introduce unreachable runtime code and thus do not require investigation."
