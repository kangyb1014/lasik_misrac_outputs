  "explanation": "No direct use of memcmp is present in the supplied code. The defined helper iov_max_init_ (provided) uses sysconf and integer operations and does not call memcmp, so it does not need investigation. MHD_send_init_static_vars_ itself contains only conditional calls to platform init routines and no string comparisons. The only fragment that requires further inspection is the call to freebsd_sendfile_init_ (inside the SF_FLAGS conditional) because its implementation is not provided here \u2014 it may contain uses of memcmp that compare null-terminated strings and therefore must be checked. No other fragments in the supplied code reference memcmp or perform string comparisons with raw memory comparison functions."
