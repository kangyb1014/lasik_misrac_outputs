  "explanation": "Parameters of MHD_post_process are: struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp, const char *post_data, size_t post_data_len. A review of the function body shows no assignments or updates to these parameter variables themselves: there are no statements like pp = ..., post_data = ..., post_data_len = ..., nor any increment/decrement or compound assignments on them. The code only performs reads/inspections (null check, length check, dereferencing pp to access members, and passing the parameter values to other functions). Dereferencing pp to access/modify the object it points to would be allowed by MISRA Rule 17.8; this function only reads pp->encoding and other members (no writes to pp itself). Passing the pointers/values to post_process_urlencoded/post_process_multipart does not constitute modifying the local parameter variables. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that violate or need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
