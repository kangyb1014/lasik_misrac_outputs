  "explanation": "The only code fragment that suggests (and could actually be) unreachable is the final comment and return at the end of the function. The earlier explicit returns (for post_data_len == 0 and for NULL pp) and the two conditional returns that dispatch to post_process_urlencoded and post_process_multipart are legitimate reachable code paths and must remain to handle their respective runtime cases, so they do not by themselves indicate unreachable code. There is no other code in this function that is syntactically unreachable (all other statements can be executed depending on runtime inputs), so no additional fragments require investigation for Rule 2.1."
