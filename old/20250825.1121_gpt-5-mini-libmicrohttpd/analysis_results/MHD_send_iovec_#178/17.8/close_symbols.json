  "explanation": "- send_iov_nontls: The function may be a macro or inline or otherwise alter the control flow; need its definition to ensure it is not a macro that expands into code that assigns to the parameter identifiers (e.g. connection, r_iov or push_data). Also to confirm that the return statement calling it does not hide any local assignment to the parameters before the call.\n- send_iov_emu: Same rationale as send_iov_nontls \u2014 the code returns by calling this routine in some compilation configurations; its definition is required to ensure no macro/inline expansion modifies the target function parameters.\n- mhd_assert: This is a macro (likely) used in the function body. A macro can expand into code that has side effects (assignments). To prove the target function does not modify its parameter variables, you must inspect mhd_assert's expansion/definition.\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): Needed to confirm whether any operations in this function (or in macros it uses) could be interpreted as assignments to the parameter variable rather than modifications of the pointee. Also to check if the connection parameter type includes aliasing/qualifiers that affect whether assignments to fields could be construed as pointer modification (and to understand any macros that reference fields).\n- struct MHD_iovec_track_ (definition): The parameter r_iov is declared as 'struct MHD_iovec_track_ *const r_iov' \u2014 you need the type definition to confirm the declaration and to ensure no macro/type weirdness changes the effective declaration (and to check whether any macros operating on r_iov could rebind the pointer name).\n- MHD_VECT_SEND, HTTPS_SUPPORT, _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED: These preprocessor symbols control which code path is compiled (the blocks that declare/use local use_iov_send and which return is compiled). The compiled form could include different macro expansions or code that might modify parameters; you must know which symbols are defined to know which code to analyze.\n\nIn short: inspect the two called routines and any macros and the parameter type definitions, and the relevant preprocessor flags, to be able to determine definitively whether the target function modifies its parameter variables (as opposed to modifying the objects they point to, which is allowed)."
