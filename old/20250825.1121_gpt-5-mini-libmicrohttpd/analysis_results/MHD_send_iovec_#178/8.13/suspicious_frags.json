The three assertions and the two return calls (listed) cover the observable pointer usages in this snippet: the function parameters (pointer types) and accesses to pointer members (resp_iov.iov, response->data_iov). There are no additional pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions in the provided code that would need investigation for Rule 8.13, so they are not included."
