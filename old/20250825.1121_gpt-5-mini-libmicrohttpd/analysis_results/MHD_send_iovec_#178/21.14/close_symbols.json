  "explanation": "- send_iov_nontls: Direct callee from MHD_send_iovec_. You must inspect its body to see whether it (or functions it calls) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.  \n- send_iov_emu: Alternative callee used under different compile-time conditions; its implementation must also be checked for memcmp usage.  \n- pre_send_setopt, post_send_setopt: Listed callees of send_iov_nontls in the static graph \u2014 these may contain (or call) memcmp and thus must be inspected.  \n- memcmp: The Standard Library function whose misuse is checked by the MISRA rule; include it so the analyzer can detect direct or indirect calls and determine whether it is being applied to null-terminated strings.  \n- MHD_VECT_SEND, HTTPS_SUPPORT, _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED, MHD_USE_TLS: Preprocessor/configuration symbols that determine which path (send_iov_nontls vs send_iov_emu) is compiled/used. You must consider these to know which implementation(s) to analyze.  \n- connection->daemon->options, connection->daemon->sigpipe_blocked, connection->sk_spipe_suppress: Run-time fields read in the conditional logic that affect which call path is taken when the code is compiled with the relevant macros; they are needed to reason about which function will execute and therefore which code to inspect for memcmp misuse.\n\nInspect these symbols (implementations and uses of memcmp) to determine whether any executed path from MHD_send_iovec_ results in memcmp being used to compare null-terminated strings."
