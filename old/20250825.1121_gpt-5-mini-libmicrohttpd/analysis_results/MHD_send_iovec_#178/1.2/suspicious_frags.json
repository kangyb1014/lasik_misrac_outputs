  "explanation": "I examined the provided code for use of compiler-specific language extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __extension__ tokens, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, inline asm, nested functions, anonymous/unnamed struct/union extensions, zero-length arrays, named sections, or other tokens documented as compiler extensions). I also looked for non-standard keywords or constructs such as compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or builtins. None of these appear in the target function or the related definitions: the code uses standard C constructs, preprocessor conditionals/macros, POSIX/Win32 API types and functions (e.g. ssize_t, sendmsg, writev, WSASend) and casts, but those are platform APIs/types rather than compiler language extensions. There are no occurrences of __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, anonymous structs/unions, or other compiler-specific extensions in the provided fragments. Therefore, no code fragments need to be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
