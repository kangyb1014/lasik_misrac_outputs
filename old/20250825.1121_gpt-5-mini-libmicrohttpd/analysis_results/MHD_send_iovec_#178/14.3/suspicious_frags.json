  "explanation": "No iteration statements (for, while, do-while) appear in the function, so there are no loop controlling expressions to check against MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Preprocessor conditionals (#if / #ifdef) are compile-time directives and not runtime controlling expressions governed by this rule. The only runtime conditional is \"if (use_iov_send)\"; this depends on runtime data (connection->daemon fields and/or earlier initialisation) and is not an invariant expression. The mhd_assert macros are not loop controls. Therefore there are no candidate invariant controlling expressions in this code that require investigation under Rule 14.3."
