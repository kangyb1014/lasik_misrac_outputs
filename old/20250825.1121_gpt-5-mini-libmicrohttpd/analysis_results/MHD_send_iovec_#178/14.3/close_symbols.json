  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n- MHD_VECT_SEND: The presence/absence of this macro controls whether the runtime 'if (use_iov_send)' exists at all (the code is emitted only when this is defined). To decide if there is an invariant controlling expression you must know whether this block is compiled in.\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT and _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED: These preprocessor macros gate both the declaration/initialization of use_iov_send and the later runtime modifications of that flag. They affect whether the conditional is compiled and what runtime operands contribute to its value.\n- MHD_USE_TLS: Used in the expression (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS) which is used to modify use_iov_send. Its definition/value (bit mask) is required to determine whether that expression can change at runtime or is always zero/non-zero (making use_iov_send invariant).\n- use_iov_send: The controlling expression itself. You must know how it is initialized and all assignments/updates to it in this function to determine whether the if-condition can be invariant.\n- struct MHD_Connection::daemon: The pointer to the daemon object is the object whose fields are tested to update use_iov_send; the daemon must be inspected to see if those fields can vary at runtime.\n- struct MHD_Connection::sk_spipe_suppress: This field is directly ANDed into the computation of use_iov_send (via the _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED path). Its possible values determine whether use_iov_send can vary.\n- struct MHD_Daemon::options: The options word is masked with MHD_USE_TLS to update use_iov_send; you must know its semantics/possible values to determine whether the mask expression is invariant.\n- struct MHD_Daemon::sigpipe_blocked: This field is combined with sk_spipe_suppress to produce a runtime value that affects use_iov_send. Its mutability determines whether the controlling expression can change.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine (1) whether the conditional exists after preprocessing and (2) whether the boolean tested by that conditional can be invariant (always true or false) or can vary at runtime. Without them you cannot conclude compliance/non\u2011compliance with the MISRA rule about invariant controlling expressions."
