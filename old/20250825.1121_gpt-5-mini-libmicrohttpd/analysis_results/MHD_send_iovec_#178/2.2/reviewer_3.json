  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. With the provided definition #define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0) each mhd_assert(...) line in MHD_send_iovec_ becomes an executed no-op expression statement. Removing those no-op statements would not change the behaviour of the program in that build, so they meet the definition of dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If mhd_assert is defined differently in other build configurations to perform actual checks, then those configurations would not have dead code; the violation applies to the configuration where it expands to ((void)0).)"
