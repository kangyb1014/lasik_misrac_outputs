  "explanation": "For assessing whether MHD_send_iovec_ contains dead code you must know which compile-time branches and run-time conditions can actually occur and what the callees do. Each symbol is needed for the reasons below:\n\n- send_iov_emu\n  - The function returns send_iov_emu in some compile/config combinations. Its existence/implementation is required to know whether the return path (and any work leading to it) is meaningful or could be removed without changing behavior.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The three assertions at the top could be compiled out or have side-effects depending on mhd_assert definition (e.g. NDEBUG behavior). Whether those lines are effective or dead depends on this macro.\n\n- MHD_VECT_SEND (preprocessor macro)\n  - Controls which whole branch of the function is compiled. If always defined or always undefined in builds, the other branch is dead at compile time.\n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (preprocessor macro)\n  - Alters compilation of the inner use_iov_send logic and selection of send path; if always/never defined, it can make parts of the code dead.\n\n- _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED (preprocessor macro)\n  - Same as above: affects compile-time presence of the conditional code that manipulates use_iov_send.\n\n- MHD_USE_TLS (option flag macro/value)\n  - Used together with connection->daemon->options to decide use_iov_send when HTTPS_SUPPORT is compiled in. Its value and how options are encoded determine whether the HTTPS-related condition can ever be true.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon::options\n  - Runtime field tested (bitwise & MHD_USE_TLS) when HTTPS_SUPPORT is active. To know if that runtime test can vary (and thus whether the code path is live) you need the semantics/value ranges of options.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon::sigpipe_blocked\n  - Used (when _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED is compiled) to compute use_iov_send. If this flag is always true/false for all daemons, the dependent code might be dead.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection::sk_spipe_suppress\n  - Similarly used to compute use_iov_send; its possible values affect whether the use_iov_send branch is ever taken.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection::rp.resp_iov.iov\n- struct MHD_Connection::rp.resp_iov.cnt\n- struct MHD_Connection::rp.resp_iov.sent\n- struct MHD_Connection::rp.response->data_iov\n  - These fields are asserted at function entry; knowledge of their invariants (whether they can be NULL or fixed values) is necessary to tell whether the assertions and any code dependent on these invariants are meaningful or are dead. In particular, if higher-level invariants guarantee these conditions always hold, the assertions may be redundant (dead) or vice versa.\n\nNotes on scope: the static call graph already listed send_iov_nontls and its internal callees; send_iov_nontls behaviour is also relevant but was present in the provided graph. The items above are the additional compile-time macros and runtime fields needed to determine whether either branch (the vect-send path vs. the emulation path), the assertion checks, or the use_iov_send logic are effectively dead code in any supported build/runtime configuration."
