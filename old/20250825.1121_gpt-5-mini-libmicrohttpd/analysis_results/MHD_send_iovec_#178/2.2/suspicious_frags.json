  "explanation": "I listed the code fragments that are potentially subject to being dead code (or no-ops) so they can be inspected in context. Other parts of the function need not be investigated for Rule 2.2 because:\n\n- The function signature, parameters and local references are all used in calls and expressions elsewhere in the function, so they are not extraneous code.\n- The preprocessor conditionals around the send branches cause different code to be emitted at compile time; the compiled code will contain only the branches appropriate for the defined macros, so there is no inherent unreachable sequence of statements in the generated translation unit except those explicitly listed above for review.\n- The return points and the conditional control flow depend on compile-time macros and runtime conditions; they are part of the function's normal behavior and are not obviously removable without changing semantics.\n- No other standalone assignments, initializations, or statements in the remainder of the function are unused or redundant given the code shown.\n\nTherefore the remaining code fragments (other than the ones provided above) do not present prima facie evidence of dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2 and do not require further investigation based on the supplied source."
