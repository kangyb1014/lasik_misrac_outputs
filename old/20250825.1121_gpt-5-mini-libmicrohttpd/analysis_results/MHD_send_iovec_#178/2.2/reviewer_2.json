Those statements are executed but have no effect and could be removed without changing program behaviour, i.e. they are dead code.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids \u2018\u2018dead code\u2019\u2019 defined as an operation that is executed and whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Although mhd_assert expands to the no\u2011op expression statement ((void)0); that expansion is intentionally used to neutralize assertions. Whether removing that statement would or would not affect program behaviour is not something that can be assumed: in embedded systems even a no\u2011op can affect timing, optimisation boundaries, or other observable behaviour. Thus you cannot categorically classify those macro expansions as \u2018\u2018dead code\u2019\u2019 under the rule. In practice this pattern (assertions expanding to ((void)0)) is the standard way to disable assertions and is not considered a Rule 2.2 violation unless you can prove removal has no effect. Therefore the agent A claim is incorrect."
