  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Given the provided macro definition (#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)) the statement\n  mhd_assert(connection->rp.resp_iov.cnt > connection->rp.resp_iov.sent);\nexpands to the expression statement ((void)0); that is a no\u2011op with no side effects. Removal of that statement cannot alter program behaviour in the given project configuration, so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, however, the macro is defined differently in other project configurations so that the assertion performs runtime checks, then those builds would not contain dead code \u2014 but based on the provided project macro definition, the report is correct.)"
