That operation, as present in the compiled code, has no effect on program behaviour and can be removed without changing behaviour, therefore it constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_send_iovec_:\n#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Given the provided macro definition (#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)), each mhd_assert statement in MHD_send_iovec_ becomes an expression statement that performs no action. Those statements are executed (they are reachable) but have no effect and can be removed without changing program behaviour; that matches the Rule 2.2 definition of dead code. (Note: if the project configuration used a different definition of mhd_assert that produced side\u2011effects, the conclusion could differ; the above conclusion is valid for the supplied macro definition and resulting translation unit.)"
