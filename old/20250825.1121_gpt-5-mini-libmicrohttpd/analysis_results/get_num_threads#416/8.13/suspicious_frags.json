  "explanation": "I inspected the entire get_num_threads function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should point to const-qualified types when possible. This function contains no pointer declarations or pointer-typed variables: all local variables are unsigned int, and the commented-out blocks only show a static const unsigned int (not a pointer). The printf calls use string literals (const char[]), which are passed to printf that accepts const char * \u2014 there are no non-const char * uses. The called helpers (get_cpu_core_count, get_process_cpu_core_count) are used as integer-returning functions in this context (no pointer results or pointer parameters are visible here). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 8.13."
