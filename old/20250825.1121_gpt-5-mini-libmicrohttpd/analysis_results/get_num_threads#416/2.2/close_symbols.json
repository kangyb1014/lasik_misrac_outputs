  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for a dead\u2011code (MISRA) analysis of get_num_threads:\n\n- num_threads (global variable) \u2014 declaration and all write-sites: The function behavior pivots on the current value of num_threads (early return if >0, and assignments inside the function). To determine whether any branch or assignment in get_num_threads is actually dead (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour) you must know initial value(s), where else the variable is written, and whether those writes make the early return or later assignments redundant.\n\n- get_cpu_core_count (function) \u2014 full implementation: The returned CPU count determines the main control flow (num_threads = get_cpu_core_count()/2; possible zero, nonzero ranges). You must know its return range and side effects to decide whether subsequent branches (setting num_threads to 1, printing, etc.) can ever execute and whether they are removable.\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count (function) \u2014 full implementation: The comparison with num_proc_cpus controls whether the function prints one message or the other and whether num_threads is reduced. Its semantics and possible return values are needed to know if the printing/assignment branches are reachable and whether their removal would affect observable behaviour.\n\n- detect_cpu_core_count and detect_process_cpu_core_count (implementations): These are the underlying providers of the values above (they may access hardware, return static values, or have side effects). If get_cpu_core_count/get_process_cpu_core_count are thin wrappers, analysis must inspect the detect_* implementations for ranges/side effects.\n\n- printf (or project's logging/IO wrapper) \u2014 implementation/aliasing: The function issues printf calls. Printing is an observable side effect; to decide whether those printf statements are dead you must know whether they actually produce observable output in the target environment (e.g. whether printf is mapped to a no-op, buffered/redirected, or has additional side effects). If printf is non\u2011observed in the runtime, removal might be benign; otherwise it is not dead.\n\n- All places that call or modify num_threads (callers and writers) \u2014 e.g. check_param__connections, init_data, run_mhd, main, other TUs: To determine if some operations in get_num_threads are redundant you must see the whole program behaviour: callers could rely on side effects or pre-set num_threads so the early return becomes relevant. Any other writers may make portions of this function never executed (or conversely required). Provide locations so the analyzer can determine liveness of assignments/branches.\n\n- Build/configuration macros and symbols that control conditional compilation in this TU (and max_threads if that block can be enabled): The function contains #if 0 disabled blocks. If build macros differ across configurations, those blocks (and symbols such as max_threads) could become active; the dead\u2011code analysis must consider the actual build configuration used. Knowing the relevant macros ensures the analyzer inspects the correct compiled code.\n\nProvide the above symbol definitions/locations to the next agent so it can decide whether any statements in get_num_threads are executed but removable without changing program behaviour (the MISRA dead\u2011code criterion)."
