Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other fragments in get_num_threads are active code paths that (a) assign to the static variable num_threads or (b) produce observable behaviour (printf) or (c) depend on external functions (get_cpu_core_count, get_process_cpu_core_count). Because these statements either change program state, have side effects, or rely on runtime values, their removal could change program behaviour and therefore they are not prima facie dead code. The two listed blocks are preprocessor-disabled sections present verbatim in the source and should be investigated as they appear to be unused/leftover code that the project may wish to remove or restore consistently."
