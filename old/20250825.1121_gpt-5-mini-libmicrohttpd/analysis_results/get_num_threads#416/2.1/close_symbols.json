  "explanation": "- num_threads (global variable): The function's first statement tests and returns this variable. To decide whether the 'if (0 < num_threads) return num_threads;' path (and any code after it) is reachable you must know its definition, initial value, and every place in the program that writes to it (static initializers, assignments, and concurrent updates).\n- get_cpu_core_count: get_num_threads uses its return value to compute num_threads. You need the function body, contracts and possible return range (can it return 0? what minimum/maximum?) to determine which branches in get_num_threads are reachable.\n- get_process_cpu_core_count: its return value is compared to num_threads to select between two branches. Knowing its possible returns is required to determine whether the \"num_proc_cpus >= num_threads\" branch (and the alternate branch that assigns num_threads = num_proc_cpus) can occur.\n- detect_cpu_core_count and detect_process_cpu_core_count: these are the lower-level routines invoked by the above getters. If the getters are thin wrappers, their implementations determine the actual return values and edge cases (e.g., error paths returning 0) that affect reachability of branches in get_num_threads.\n- init_data, check_param__connections, run_mhd, main: These callers (from the static call graph) may initialize or modify num_threads before get_num_threads is invoked. You must inspect their code to see whether they set num_threads such that some branches in get_num_threads become unreachable.\n- ALL other functions/locations that define or assign to num_threads: If there are additional writers (not listed above), they must be examined because any assignment to num_threads elsewhere can make certain branches in get_num_threads reachable or unreachable.\n\nCollecting the above symbols/definitions lets an analyzer determine whether any conditional or whole blocks in get_num_threads can never be executed (i.e., are unreachable) and thus whether the MISRA rule on unreachable code is violated."
