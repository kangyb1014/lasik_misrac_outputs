  "explanation": "To prove whether get_num_threads is (directly or indirectly) recursive we must examine all functions it calls and the functions those call, to see if any path leads back to get_num_threads. 1) get_cpu_core_count \u2014 direct callee of get_num_threads; its body may call other functions that could (directly or indirectly) call get_num_threads. 2) get_process_cpu_core_count \u2014 direct callee of get_num_threads; its body may call other functions that could lead back to get_num_threads. 3) detect_cpu_core_count \u2014 direct callee of get_cpu_core_count (per the static graph); its implementation must be checked for any call chain back to get_num_threads. 4) detect_process_cpu_core_count \u2014 direct callee of get_process_cpu_core_count and (per the graph) a caller of get_cpu_core_count; it is a potential link in an indirect call cycle and therefore must be inspected for any path that reaches get_num_threads. Checking these four symbols (their implementations and the functions they call recursively as needed) is sufficient to determine whether any call sequence starting from get_num_threads can return to get_num_threads and thus violate the MISRA rule."
