  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required:\n\n- num_threads\n  - The target function reads and writes this global. Confirming its declaration/type (unsigned int or otherwise), storage duration and initialization is needed to rule out any hidden pointer or buffer usage that could interact with string functions. Also needed to check whether its value could be used later to size buffers in other code paths.\n\n- get_cpu_core_count (declaration + implementation)\n  - The target function calls this. To determine whether the overall code path (starting from get_num_threads) involves any <string.h> functions that could access out-of-bounds memory, we must inspect this function\u2019s signature (return type and parameters) and its implementation to see if it calls any string.h routines or returns/accepts pointers to buffers that could be misused.\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count (declaration + implementation)\n  - Same rationale as get_cpu_core_count: it is called by the target function and may internally use string-handling functions or propagate pointers/lengths that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses. Its prototype is needed to ensure it returns an integer (not a pointer) and to inspect its internals for unsafe string.h usage.\n\n- detect_cpu_core_count (implementation)\n  - get_cpu_core_count calls this (per the static call graph). The deepest implementation must be checked for any use of string.h APIs (e.g., parsing /proc data, using memcpy/str* functions) that could produce out-of-bounds accesses along the call chain from get_num_threads.\n\n- detect_process_cpu_core_count (implementation)\n  - get_process_cpu_core_count calls this. Inspect its implementation for any string.h function usage or buffer manipulations that could violate the rule when that call is exercised from get_num_threads.\n\n- printf (declaration from <stdio.h>)\n  - The target function uses printf with string literals. Although printf is not in <string.h>, confirm its declaration and ensure no use of %s with externally supplied pointers occurs here. This is mainly to document that the only formatted output here is fixed literal strings (no string.h involvement), but include it for completeness in the analysis.\n\n- max_threads (compile-time disabled symbol - for completeness)\n  - The code referencing max_threads is inside #if 0 and not compiled, but include the symbol for completeness in case a build configuration enables it. If enabled, the related code contains printf with an unsigned format and an assignment; checking max_threads\u2019 type/value ensures no hidden buffer/string issues are introduced when that code is active.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule targets use of <string.h> functions. The target function itself contains no calls to string.h APIs; the necessary additional symbols listed above are the callees (and their implementations) that must be inspected to ensure the call chain from get_num_threads does not invoke any string.h functions that can cause out-of-bounds accesses. Inspecting their prototypes and implementations will allow the next analyst to determine compliance."
