  "explanation": "To determine whether get_num_threads violates the MISRA rule forbidding compiler/language extensions, the analyzer must inspect not only the visible source text but also the declarations and any macros/headers that can introduce compiler-specific extensions. Specifically:\n\n- num_threads (declaration/definition): The global variable's declaration/storage-class may include compiler extensions (e.g. __thread, __attribute__((...)), register/asm annotations, or non\u2011standard qualifiers). The analyzer must see that declaration to determine if the function's use of num_threads relies on an extension.\n\n- get_cpu_core_count (prototype/definition): The function call itself might be to a function whose prototype uses compiler-specific attributes or nonstandard types (e.g. __attribute__, inline definitions, or typedefs based on extensions). The declaration/definition is needed to detect such extensions that affect calls in get_num_threads.\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count (prototype/definition): Same rationale as for get_cpu_core_count \u2014 its declaration/definition may contain compiler extensions that the call in get_num_threads depends on.\n\n- printf (declaration / any project wrapper macro): printf could be a plain standard library function or a project macro/wrapper that expands to code using compiler extensions. Inspecting its declaration or macro definition ensures the call site in this function does not rely on an extension.\n\n- Relevant project headers / macro definitions that could redefine tokens used in this function: Preprocessor macros in included project headers can rename or replace tokens (for example, replacing identifiers with builtin/extended constructs). Any header that declares the above symbols or defines macros named like printf, num_threads, get_cpu_core_count, get_process_cpu_core_count must be checked for compiler-specific extensions.\n\nNote: The disabled #if 0 blocks are not compiled and do not by themselves indicate an extension; however, the above symbols and headers must be inspected to decide conclusively whether any language extensions are used by the compiled version of get_num_threads."
