  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided function. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/MSVC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), __builtin_*, or nonstandard keywords present.\n- The adjacent string literal concatenation across lines is standard C and not an extension.\n- The #if 0 / #endif disabled blocks are preprocessor usage, not a language extension.\n- The function declaration (static unsigned int get_num_threads(void)), local variable declarations and use of printf are standard C.\n\nNote: External functions called (get_cpu_core_count, get_process_cpu_core_count) are referenced but their declarations are not shown; an implicit function declaration would be a separate concern for other MISRA rules or language-standard conformance, but it is not a compiler-specific extension and therefore not within the scope of Rule 1.2. No fragments require investigation for use of language extensions."
