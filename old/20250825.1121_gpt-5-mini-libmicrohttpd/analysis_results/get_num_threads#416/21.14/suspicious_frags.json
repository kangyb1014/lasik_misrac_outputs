  "explanation": "I inspected all provided code (get_num_threads, get_cpu_core_count, get_process_cpu_core_count, detect_cpu_core_count, detect_process_cpu_core_count) including the #if 0 disabled blocks. There are no calls to the C library function memcmp anywhere in these fragments, and no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. All comparisons are numeric (integers/unsigned ints) or string literals used only in printf/fprintf formatting. Therefore there are no code fragments here that trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Note: external helper functions referenced (mhd_tool_*, detect_*) are not shown; their implementations should be inspected separately if available, since they could contain memcmp usages outside the provided code."
