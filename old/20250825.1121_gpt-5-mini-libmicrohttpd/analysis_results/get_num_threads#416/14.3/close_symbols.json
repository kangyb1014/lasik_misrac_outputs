  "explanation": "- num_threads: the controlling expressions (if (0 < num_threads), if (0 == num_threads), comparisons later) depend on this global. You must inspect its definition (storage class, initialiser, volatile/atomic qualification) and all direct assignments to determine whether the expressions can be invariant at compile time.\n- get_cpu_core_count: get_num_threads uses its return to set num_threads. You must inspect its implementation or contract to determine whether it can return a compile-time invariant value or has side effects that affect num_threads or program state.\n- get_process_cpu_core_count: same reason as get_cpu_core_count \u2014 the later branching and assignment to num_threads depends on its return value; inspect whether it is constant or has side effects.\n- detect_cpu_core_count: get_cpu_core_count calls this; include it so the analysis can follow down to an implementation that might be constant or modify globals.\n- detect_process_cpu_core_count: get_process_cpu_core_count calls this; include to determine whether the process-specific count is invariant or has side effects.\n- check_param__connections: listed as a caller of get_num_threads. Include to check whether it (or other callers) assign to num_threads before/after calling get_num_threads, which affects whether the controlling expressions in get_num_threads are invariant.\n- init_data: calls get_num_threads and get_cpu_core_count; include to see whether it mutates num_threads or otherwise makes the controlling expressions invariant in context.\n- run_mhd: calls get_num_threads; include to verify whether it writes to num_threads or relies on a constant value, affecting invariance analysis.\n- check_apply_param__all_cpus and check_apply_param__threads: these appear in the call graph around cpu-count helpers and may set global/thread-count configuration; include them to determine whether they set or fix num_threads (making expressions invariant).\n- main: include as the program root to find any other initialisation or assignments to num_threads that would make the controlling expressions invariant.\n\nIn short: inspect the declaration/definitions of num_threads and the implementations of the CPU-count functions and all functions that may write num_threads (callers/initialisers). That set is needed to determine whether the controlling expressions in get_num_threads can be considered invariant for the purposes of the MISRA rule."
