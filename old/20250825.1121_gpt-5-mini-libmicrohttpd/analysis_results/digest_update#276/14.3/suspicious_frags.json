  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the presented function are invariant. The only conditional constructs are if statements whose controlling expressions compare da->algo (a function parameter derived at runtime) against constant enumerators; these are not invariant. There are no iteration statements (for/while/do) whose controlling expressions could be constant or create an unintended infinite/constant loop. The chained if/else structure is implemented with preprocessor guards; the else tokens are inside the corresponding #ifdef blocks, so preprocessing will not produce a stray or invariant controlling expression. The final mhd_assert(0) is an assertion statement, not a loop-controlling expression; even if it is compiled out in non-debug builds it does not introduce an invariant controlling expression. Therefore there are no fragments here that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
