  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages found w.r.t. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasons:\n\n- The input buffer parameter is declared const: \"const void *data\" and all uses cast it to a const-qualified byte pointer (\"(const uint8_t *) data\"). This satisfies the requirement that pointers to input data be const-qualified whenever possible.\n\n- The DigestAlgorithm pointer parameter is \"struct DigestAlgorithm *da\". It is written to (da->hashing = true) under _DEBUG, so the pointee cannot be const-qualified; making da point to const would prevent this legitimate modification.\n\n- The addresses of algorithm contexts are passed as &da->ctx.md5_ctx, &da->ctx.sha256_ctx, etc. Those contexts are (presumably) modified by the corresponding update functions (given their names), so their pointers must be to non-const types; therefore these uses do not violate Rule 8.13.\n\n- The mhd_assert() checks only read fields of da and do not require const qualification changes.\n\nGiven the code shown, all pointer targets are either already const-qualified where appropriate or must remain non-const because the code (or called update functions) modifies the pointee. Therefore there are no fragments to escalate for Rule 8.13."
