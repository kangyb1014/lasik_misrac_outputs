  "explanation": "Most of the function does not call any of the standard <string.h> routines (memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn, etc.) and performs defensive checks: the code verifies nc_param->value.str is not NULL and that nc_param->value.len is non\u2011zero before any indexed access; it sets val/val_len consistently for the quoted and unquoted branches; subsequent reads from val are guarded by the earlier length check. The only operations that can write into a local object or otherwise require scrutiny for out\u2011of\u2011bounds string accesses are the buffer declaration and the calls that may copy or parse the input (the unq buffer and the two helper routines). Therefore, other lines (pointer/null checks, length comparisons, final range checks and the assignment to *nc) do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
