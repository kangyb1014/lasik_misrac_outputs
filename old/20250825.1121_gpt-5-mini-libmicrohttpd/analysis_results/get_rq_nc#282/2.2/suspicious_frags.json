  "explanation": "No dead-code fragments detected. Every executed operation in get_rq_nc contributes to the observable behaviour (return code or output *nc):\n- The local pointer nc_param is used repeatedly to access the incoming value and quoted flag. Removing it would require changing multiple uses.\n- The early returns (NULL check, zero-length checks, too-long, broken) affect the returned enum and are therefore not removable.\n- The unq buffer, MHD_str_unquote call and assignment of val/val_len in the quoted branch are used to obtain the string that is parsed; they affect control flow and the eventual return value.\n- The call to MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_, the res check, the character-class check on val[0], the val_len != res check and the UINT32_MAX comparison all determine which enum is returned or set *nc; none are redundant.\n- The final assignment *nc = (uint32_t) nc_val and return of MHD_GET_RQ_NC_VALID are required for correct output.\n\nNotes: unreachable code is not considered dead code per the rule; this function contains no unreachable blocks. Initialization vs assignment concerns do not apply here because there are no assignments whose removal would leave behaviour unchanged."
