The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Rationale for each required symbol:\n\n1) mhd_tool_str_to_uint\n   - get_param_value calls mhd_tool_str_to_uint and uses its return value (digits) and side effects (it writes through param_value). MISRA's for-loop rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body \u2014 therefore any for-statements inside mhd_tool_str_to_uint (or side-effects it performs on objects reachable from the caller) must be inspected to determine compliance. Inspecting the full definition/implementation (and its prototype) is required to see whether it contains for loops, whether those loops are well-formed, and whether they modify objects that could be used as loop counters or loop-control flags in any enclosing for statement.\n\n2) fprintf\n   - get_param_value calls fprintf. Although fprintf is a standard library function and unlikely to affect caller loop counters, the MISRA phrasing again requires considering the behaviour of called functions when assessing for-loop bodies. To be thorough you must at least know the signature/semantics of fprintf (and, if analyzing all code for MISRA compliance, whether any wrapper or replacement of fprintf is used in this project) to confirm it does not introduce relevant side effects or use/modify objects from the caller.\n\nNote: get_param_value itself contains no for statements, so it cannot directly violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule. The only way it could be relevant is via called functions; hence the minimal set of additional symbols to inspect are its callees (above). Definitions of the enum PerfRepl_param_result and the PERF_RPL_* constants affect return values but do not influence for-loop well-formedness and therefore are not required for this specific rule check."
