  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C: a static function, use of an enum as a return type, pointer parameters, standard library identifiers (NULL, size_t, fprintf), array indexing, character and integer comparisons, and simple control flow. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__/asm, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions ({: :}), GNU statement labels, anonymous or named zero-length arrays, designated initializers with non-standard behaviour, token-pasting macros, inline assembly, or other constructs documented as extensions by common compilers. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this snippet."
