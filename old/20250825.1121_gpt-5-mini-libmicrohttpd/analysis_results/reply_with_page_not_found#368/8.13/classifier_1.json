  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *c' is non-const. This is not a violation here because the pointer is forwarded to MHD_queue_response(c, ...), which (by its API) is expected to modify or enqueue state on the connection; therefore const qualification would not be possible. If, conversely, neither this function nor any callee modified the connection object and all callees accepted a pointer-to-const, then the declaration should be changed to 'const struct MHD_Connection *c' and the current code would violate Rule 8.13."
