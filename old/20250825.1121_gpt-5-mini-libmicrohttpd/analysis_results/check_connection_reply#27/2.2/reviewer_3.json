  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements \u201c(void) c;\u201d and \u201c(void) r;\u201d are expression-statements with no side-effects; they execute when the #else branch is compiled but their removal would not change the program\u2019s runtime behaviour (they only silence compiler warnings). Under the Rule 2.2 definition (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), these no-op casts qualify as dead code. Note that they are not unreachable code (so Note 2 does not apply), and compiler diagnostics are not part of the program behaviour referred to by the rule, so the presence of the casts to suppress warnings does not exempt them."
