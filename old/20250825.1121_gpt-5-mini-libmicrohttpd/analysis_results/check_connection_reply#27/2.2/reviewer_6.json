Removing the initialization would not change program behaviour in that build configuration \u2014 this is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 explicitly states (note 3) that initialization is not the same as an assignment and is therefore not a candidate for dead code; an initializer that is executed cannot be flagged as dead code by this rule. Moreover, the initializations here are not pure no-ops: r is initialized from c->rp.response (and both initializers perform reads that could matter e.g. if members are volatile or if reading has timing/ordering implications), so removing them could change behaviour. The (void) c and (void) r lines are simply to suppress unused-variable warnings in the build without HAVE_MESSAGES. For these reasons the claimed violation is incorrect."
