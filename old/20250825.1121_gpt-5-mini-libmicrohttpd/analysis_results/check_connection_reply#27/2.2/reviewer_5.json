Removing that statement does not change program behaviour (it only silences an unused-variable compiler warning), so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statements (void) r; and (void) c; in the #else branch are expression statements that do nothing (they evaluate a non-volatile pointer and discard the result). Removing them does not change program behaviour, so they meet the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If the referenced object were volatile or its evaluation had side effects, the cast-to-void would not be removable; that is not the case here.) Therefore the report that this code violates Rule 2.2 is valid."
