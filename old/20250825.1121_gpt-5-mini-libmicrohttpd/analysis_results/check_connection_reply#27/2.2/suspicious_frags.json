Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for potential dead code: the function declaration and its opening/closing braces are necessary for defining the routine; the preprocessor directives (#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES / #else / #endif) merely control compilation and are not executable statements by themselves; the string literals and underscore (_) macro usages appearing only as parameters to the logging calls (other than the logging calls themselves which are listed) are part of those logging fragments and thus either flagged or are syntactically required. Comments and spacing have no runtime effect. The remaining tokens (commas, parentheses, semicolons that are part of the listed statements) are part of the suspicious fragments already reported. These other elements therefore do not constitute executed operations that could be removed without effect, so they are not considered suspicious for Rule 2.2."
