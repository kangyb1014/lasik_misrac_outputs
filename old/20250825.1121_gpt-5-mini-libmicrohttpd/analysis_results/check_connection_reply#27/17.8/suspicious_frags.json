  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter 'connection' is not modified: it is only used to initialize local const pointer aliases (struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection; and struct MHD_Response *const r = c->rp.response;). These initializations do not assign to or modify the parameter itself. All subsequent uses dereference the pointer to read fields (and to pass values to logging), which is permitted (the rule allows modifying the object pointed to, but not the pointer parameter). The (void) casts only silence unused-variable warnings and do not modify the parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate or require investigation for Rule 17.8 in this function."
