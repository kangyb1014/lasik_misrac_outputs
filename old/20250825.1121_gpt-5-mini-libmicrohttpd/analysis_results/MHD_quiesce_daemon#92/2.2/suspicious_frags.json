  "explanation": "I have reported fragments that are candidates for being executed yet have no observable effect (or only logging/side-effect checks) depending on runtime configuration; these should be examined for possible dead-code violations. Other parts of the function were not reported because they are regular control-flow checks or perform observable side effects and therefore are unlikely to constitute dead code without broader context: - The initial ret assignment and the early-return checks (invalid socket / already quiesced) are control-flow and clearly affect behavior. - The conditional compilation and loop control (declaration of i, the for loop over worker_pool) are structural and dependent on runtime data (worker_pool, sizes) and so cannot be assumed dead. - Calls to epoll_ctl and MHD_PANIC are error-handling with side effects (system calls, process termination/panic) and thus cannot be removed without changing behaviour. - The use of MHD_itc_activate_ (write to an inter-thread channel) has side effects; whether it succeeds is runtime-dependent and removal would change behaviour. - The return at the end and the use of ret are functional. In short, fragments that perform system calls, set flags that are later tested, or cause process-wide panic were not flagged because their removal would change program behaviour; only the listed fragments look potentially redundant or no-op in realistic configurations and thus warrant investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.2 compliance."
