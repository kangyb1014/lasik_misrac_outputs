  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs: static storage-class specifier, an enum return type, const char* parameters, standard library call (fprintf), a do/while loop, pre-increment of a pointer, and array subscripting ((++params_str)[0]) \u2014 all conforming to standard C (no GNU/Clang/MSVC-specific keywords such as __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, __asm__, asm, nested functions, statement-expressions, or other documented compiler extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigating for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
