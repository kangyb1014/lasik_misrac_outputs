  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant, so none trigger MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3. Details:\n\n- if (0 == params_str[0]) \u2014 the condition depends on the runtime value pointed to by params_str[0], so it is not invariant.\n\n- } while (0 != (++params_str)[0]); \u2014 the controlling expression both modifies params_str (prefix ++) and then tests the character it points to; because params_str changes on each iteration the expression is variant (not an invariant). Note: although the controlling expression has a side effect, that makes it variable rather than invariant; Rule 14.3 concerns invariance, and the shown do-while is not an invariant controlling expression.  \n\nNo do-while with an integer constant expression or any other compile-time constant controlling expression is present, and there are no other loop/conditional controls that are constant. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 14.3. If you want me to check this code against other MISRA rules (e.g., use of side effects in expressions), say so and I will identify fragments to review."
