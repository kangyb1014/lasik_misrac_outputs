  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space is dead (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour), we must know whether the calls it makes (and the data passed to them) have observable side effects that would be lost if the calls were removed. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- transmit_error_response_len\n  - This is the main callee invoked from two places in the function. Its implementation must be inspected to see what side effects (connection state changes, queued responses, resource frees, logging) occur so we can decide if removing either call would change behaviour.\n\n- connection_close_error\n  - Called (directly or indirectly) by transmit_error_response_len in the call graph. If it closes/marks the connection or triggers termination behaviour, removing a prior transmit call could change timing or connection state visible to the system.\n\n- MHD_queue_response\n  - Queuing a response changes externally visible behaviour (what is sent). We must know whether transmit_error_response_len enqueues responses and whether removing a call would remove an observable queued response.\n\n- MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_destroy_response\n  - Resource creation/destruction used to build responses. If these allocate/destroy response objects used by networking, their presence/absence affects runtime behaviour and resource lifetime.\n\n- MHD_pool_deallocate, MHD_pool_reset\n  - Memory-pool operations are side-effecting. They can change memory/resource state in ways observable elsewhere; remove/retain may alter behaviour.\n\n- build_header_response\n  - Builds the headers for the error response. Header differences are externally visible and thus relevant to dead-code determination.\n\n- MHD_DLOG\n  - Logging calls are side-effects (observable in logs). Whether logs count as program behaviour depends on policy, but to be conservative we must know if transmit_error_response_len logs and whether that is considered observable.\n\n- get_no_space_err_status_code\n  - Computes the err_code used in the second transmit call. We must inspect it to see whether its result depends on connection state (which might be affected by the earlier transmit) or on other side effects, so removing the first call might change the computed err_code and hence behaviour.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value_n\n  - Called by get_no_space_err_status_code per the call graph. Its semantics (reading connection metadata) might be affected by earlier operations; its behaviour influences err_code.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - The connection object is passed to both transmit calls and to get_no_space_err_status_code. We need its layout and semantics to determine what side effects (flags, queued state) these functions read or modify.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_CONTENT_TOO_LARGE, MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_CHUNKED\n  - Status-code constants used when calling transmit_error_response_len and get_no_space_err_status_code. To know the externally visible response and whether removing calls changes it, we must know these values and semantics.\n\n- ERR_MSG_REQUEST_CHUNK_LINE_EXT_TOO_BIG, ERR_MSG_REQUEST_CHUNK_LINE_TOO_BIG\n  - The exact error message payloads passed to transmit_error_response_len; message content is externally visible and relevant to deciding if a call is dead.\n\nNotes: memchr and basic standard-library helpers are not required beyond knowing they are pure/read-only (no side effects). The crucial pieces are transmit_error_response_len and all functions it calls (and the status-code/message symbols and the connection object) to fully understand observable side effects; only with that information can we conclude whether either transmit call (or other statements) is removable without changing program behaviour."
