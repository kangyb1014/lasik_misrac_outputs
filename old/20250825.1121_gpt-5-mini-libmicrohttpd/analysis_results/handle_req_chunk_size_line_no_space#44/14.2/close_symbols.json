Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n\n- transmit_error_response_len (definition)\n  - This is the direct callee from the target. Any for-loop inside this function contributes to the behaviour of execution started from the target. To determine compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule we must inspect this function\u2019s for-loops (loop counter declarations, condition expressions, increment expressions, and side-effects in the body or in called functions).\n\n- get_no_space_err_status_code (definition)\n  - Direct callee that is invoked to compute err_code. If it contains any for-loops or if its for-loops use or modify objects passed from the target (parameters c, chunk_size_line, chunk_size_line_size) or globals, these loops must be checked for the three-clause requirements and for unintended modifications of loop counters or of objects used in loop clauses.\n\n- MHD_DLOG (definition)\n  - A callee of transmit_error_response_len. Logging routines can contain loops (formatting, buffer handling). Any for-loop here contributes to the overall behaviour and must be checked for proper loop-counter usage and absence of forbidden side-effects.\n\n- connection_close_error (definition)\n  - Called by transmit_error_response_len; may iterate over connection-related structures. Its for-loops (if any) must be verified for MISRA compliance, and to ensure they do not rely on or modify objects that appear in loop clauses elsewhere.\n\n- MHD_pool_deallocate (definition)\n  - Memory-pool routines sometimes contain loops (free lists traversal). Such loops must be inspected for correct loop-counter usage and for unexpected modification of objects visible to the caller.\n\n- MHD_destroy_response (definition)\n  - May perform cleanup loops over response data. Those loops must be validated against the MISRA requirements.\n\n- MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (definition)\n  - May copy or scan buffers using loops. Any for-loops here must be checked that they have a single loop counter, no forbidden side-effects in clauses, and do not modify loop counters in their bodies or in called functions.\n\n- MHD_queue_response (definition)\n  - Queuing code may iterate over headers or lists; its loops must be examined for the rule.\n\n- build_header_response (definition)\n  - Likely to contain loops that build headers (concat/scan). Those loops contribute to behaviour and must be checked for proper loop control and that loop clauses do not use objects modified in the loop body.\n\n- MHD_pool_reset (definition)\n  - Pool reset/iteration may use loops; those must be inspected for proper loop-counter usage and side-effects.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (definition)\n  - Callee of get_no_space_err_status_code. It may contain loops that access connection values. Any for-loops here must be validated because their behaviour is part of the behaviour of the callee invoked from the target.\n\nNotes/assumptions:\n- The MISRA rule concerns for-statements anywhere in the execution path reachable from the target function because the rule counts function calls as part of the for-loop behaviour. Therefore we include direct callees of the target and the callees of those functions (as shown by the static call graph) that could contain loops.\n- Standard library functions (e.g., memchr) are not included unless their implementation is part of the analyzed codebase; if memchr is implemented in the project and accessible, include its definition as well for the same reasons.\n- Constant macros/strings used as error codes/messages are irrelevant to for-loop well-formedness and are omitted."
