  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I inspected the function for constructs that are commonly implemented as compiler-specific language extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), anonymous structs/unions specific to some compilers, GCC/Clang builtins (__builtin_*), GCC case-range extensions, or other non-standard tokens starting/ending with double underscores). None of these appear in the code snippet.\n\nNotable elements that might be mistaken for extensions but are standard C and do not require compiler-specific extensions:\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT, #ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT) and the macro-defined UPGRADE_SUPPORT are standard.\n- The backslash used to split the source line in the mhd_assert call is a standard preprocessor line-continuation, not a compiler extension.\n- Use of switch/case fall-through (multiple case labels for the same block) is standard C.\n- Function calls to external libraries (gnutls_record_get_direction, MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG, mhd_assert) and use of macros like _() are library/macros usage, not compiler language extensions.\n- Control-flow constructs (while(1), return, break, continue) and bitwise operations are all standard.\n\nBecause none of the above extension-specific tokens or constructs are present, I found no code fragments that should be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
