  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that assign to the pointer parameters themselves. In the shown functions (MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info, has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer, check_and_grow_read_buffer_space, try_grow_read_buffer and the calls/macros used within) only members of the structure pointed to (e.g. connection->event_loop_info, connection->read_buffer, connection->read_buffer_size, etc.) are modified. There are no statements that reassign the parameter variables (no \"connection = ...\", \"c = ...\", or similar) and no pointer parameters are returned or overwritten. Passing the pointer to other functions is allowed and does not violate Rule 17.8; those calls either read members or modify the pointee, which is permitted. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
