  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions found. Reasoning by control construct:\n\n- Initial if: if (! str || ! out_val || ! isasciidigit (str[0])) \u2014 depends on the pointer arguments and the result of isasciidigit(str[0]) at runtime, so it is not an invariant.\n\n- do-while loop: do { ... } while (isasciidigit (*str)); the loop condition depends on *str, which is modified inside the loop (str++), and on isasciidigit, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n\n- Inner overflow check: if ((res > (UINT64_MAX / 10)) || ((res == (UINT64_MAX / 10)) && ((uint64_t) digit > (UINT64_MAX % 10)))) \u2014 depends on the variable res and digit, both of which are updated during the loop, so this is not invariant.\n\n- isasciidigit implementation: return (c >= '0') && (c <= '9'); \u2014 the result depends on the parameter c passed at runtime; the function does not produce a compile-time constant.\n\nBecause every controlling expression depends on runtime-varying values (function parameters or variables updated in the loop), none constitute an invariant controlling expression that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
