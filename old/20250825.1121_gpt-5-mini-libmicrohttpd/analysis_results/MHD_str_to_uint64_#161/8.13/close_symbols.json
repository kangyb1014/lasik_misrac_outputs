  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each required symbol:\n\n- uint64_t\n  - Needed to know the exact typedef and any qualifiers (e.g. if the typedef in this codebase carries qualifiers or is an alias to a different type). This matters for determining whether a pointer-to-uint64_t could/should be const-qualified and to confirm that writing '*out_val = res' legitimately prevents making the pointee const.\n\n- size_t\n  - Provides the underlying type used for the function return and any rules/qualifiers that could affect pointer constness analysis in the surrounding API. (Mostly for completeness of type interpretation in the analysis context.)\n\n- UINT64_MAX\n  - Required to understand the integer-constant expressions and types used in the overflow checks; ensures no hidden casts/qualifiers change the effective types involved (which could influence whether a parameter needs to be non-const for correct semantics).\n\n- isasciidigit (declaration/definition)\n  - The function is called with characters from 'str'. We need its prototype/definition to confirm it does not require a non-const pointer or perform side-effects on the input buffer. If it were to accept a pointer to char (not the case here) or to mutate memory, that could affect whether 'str' must be non-const.\n\n- declarations / prototypes of all callers of MHD_str_to_uint64_ (call sites)\n  - MISRA\u2019s guidance \u201cpointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d is global: to decide whether out_val should be a pointer-to-const we must see how the function is used. If callers rely on MHD_str_to_uint64_ to store a value into *out_val (i.e. they expect the function to modify the pointed object), then out_val cannot be a pointer-to-const. Examining call sites determines whether out_val could be made const or must remain a mutable target.\n\n- public prototype/header for MHD_str_to_uint64_\n  - The externally visible declaration (header) may document intended semantics (in/out parameter status) or carry different qualifiers than the internal definition. The header determines the API contract; if the public prototype already uses a non-const uint64_t * for an output parameter that callers rely on, that informs the MISRA assessment.\n\nThese symbols together let the analyst determine whether any pointer in the target function could reasonably be changed to point to a const-qualified type without breaking semantics (the core of the MISRA rule check)."
