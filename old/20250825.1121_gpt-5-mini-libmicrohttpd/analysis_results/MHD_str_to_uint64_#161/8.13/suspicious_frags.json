  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameters and local pointers are:\n- const char *str \u2014 already points to a const-qualified type.\n- const char *const start = str \u2014 a const pointer to const data (stronger qualification).\n- uint64_t *out_val \u2014 intentionally points to a non-const uint64_t because the function stores the parsed value via *out_val; making the pointed-to type const would prevent the required write.\nThere are no other pointer objects in the function that could be made to point to const-qualified types without breaking the intended behavior, so no fragments need further investigation under Rule 8.13."
