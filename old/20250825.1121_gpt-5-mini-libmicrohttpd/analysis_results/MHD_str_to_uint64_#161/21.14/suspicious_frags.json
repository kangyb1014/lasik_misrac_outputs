  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code (target function MHD_str_to_uint64_ and the isasciidigit helper). There are no other calls that would invoke memcmp indirectly, nor any comparisons of null-terminated strings implemented via memcmp. The code performs character-by-character checks and arithmetic on digits using isasciidigit and direct character operations, not memcmp, so no fragments in this submission are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
