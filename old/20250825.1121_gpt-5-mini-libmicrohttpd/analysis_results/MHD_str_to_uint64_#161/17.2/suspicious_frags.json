  "explanation": "I found no fragments that suggest direct or indirect recursion. Specifically:\n- MHD_str_to_uint64_ does not call itself anywhere in its body.\n- The only function it calls is isasciidigit, and that function is defined here; its body performs simple character comparisons and does not call MHD_str_to_uint64_ (or any other function). Thus there is no direct or indirect call chain leading back to MHD_str_to_uint64_.\n- There are no function pointers, callbacks, macro-generated calls, or other external function calls in the provided code that could introduce indirect recursion.\n- The loop in MHD_str_to_uint64_ is an iterative do/while loop, not a recursive call.\nGiven the supplied code and the provided definition of isasciidigit, there is no evidence of self-calls (direct or indirect) to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
