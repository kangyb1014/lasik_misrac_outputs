  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified. The initial guard (if (! str || ! out_val || ! isasciidigit (str[0])) return 0;) intentionally prevents entry for NULL pointers or a non-digit first character; after that point the do/while body is guaranteed to execute at least once (the precondition ensures str[0] is a digit). The overflow-check return is reachable for large accumulated values and certain digits; the loop body (digit computation, res *= 10, res += digit, str++) is reachable and iterates while subsequent characters are digits; the final assignment *out_val = res and the return of the consumed length are reachable when the loop exits. There are no statements following an unconditional return or branches that are never reachable under any valid interpretation of the code shown, so no fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1."
