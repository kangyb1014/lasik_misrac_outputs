  "explanation": "1) isasciidigit (definition) \u2014 The function\u2019s initial guard and loop condition depend entirely on isasciidigit. To decide whether the early return (if !isasciidigit(str[0])) or the do/while loop body can ever be executed, the precise implementation/definition (macro or function) and its semantics (which character codes it treats as digits and whether it has side effects) are required. If isasciidigit were defined as a constant or in a way that always yields the same boolean for any input, branches may be statically unreachable.\n\n2) UINT64_MAX \u2014 The overflow check inside the loop compares res against expressions involving UINT64_MAX (UINT64_MAX/10 and UINT64_MAX%10). To determine if the overflow-return branch can ever be taken (or if it is always/never true), the exact numeric value of UINT64_MAX is needed.\n\n3) uint64_t typedef \u2014 Reasoning about the overflow check and the promoted types in arithmetic requires knowing the width and semantics of uint64_t in the build (e.g. that it is a 64-bit unsigned type). This is necessary to prove whether the comparisons and arithmetic can cause the overflow branch to be reachable.\n\n4) size_t typedef \u2014 The function returns a size_t and casts (str - start) to size_t. To assess whether any return statements (and their values) are reachable/valid under target platform model (pointer difference, cast behavior), the definition/width of size_t is needed. (This is also needed if one proves certain return paths are impossible because of type-width constraints.)"
