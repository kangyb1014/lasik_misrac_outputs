  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n\n- isasciidigit (declaration/implementation): The target function repeatedly calls isasciidigit(*str). To determine whether those calls can read beyond the bounds of the object referenced by 'str' or call any string.h functions internally, the analyzer needs the exact declaration/definition (or macro expansion) of isasciidigit. That shows whether it only examines the int argument (safe) or performs additional pointer/dereference/string operations that might access out-of-bounds memory.\n\n- All callers (call sites) of MHD_str_to_uint64_ and the code that builds/passes 'str' and 'out_val': The function reads successive bytes from the buffer pointed to by 'str' until isasciidigit() returns false. Whether that can read beyond the object bounds depends on how callers allocate and terminate the buffer passed as 'str' and whether they ensure there is at least one terminating non-digit or accessible sentinel. Also callers are needed to check that 'out_val' points to a valid object. Without caller code, you cannot determine if the loop may read off the end of the caller-provided object (which is the core concern of the MISRA string.h bounds rule, even though this function itself does not call string.h APIs).\n\n- UINT64_MAX (macro): The function uses UINT64_MAX in its overflow checks. To verify the correctness of the overflow protection (which affects whether the loop or arithmetic could produce undefined behaviour or unexpected memory writes), the analyzer must know the exact value/definition of UINT64_MAX in the build environment. While not directly a string.h symbol, it affects whether arithmetic and bounds checks are correct.\n\n- uint64_t and size_t typedefs: Precise type widths and signedness (from <stdint.h> / <stddef.h>) are required to reason about comparisons, casts and the range of res and the return value (size_t). This matters when checking the correctness of the overflow checks and whether any arithmetic could cause undefined behaviour influencing memory access.\n\n- Any headers / project files that define isasciidigit (e.g. <ctype.h> or a project wrapper): If isasciidigit is a macro or wrapper (project-specific), you need the header to see its expansion and to ensure it does not call string.h functions or do additional pointer processing that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule quoted targets uses of string.h functions. The target function does not call any standard string.h functions itself; the main potential for violating the rule is indirect: if isasciidigit (or code in callers) calls string.h functions or the loop reads past the caller-provided buffer. The listed symbols are the minimal additional artifacts required to determine that conclusively."
