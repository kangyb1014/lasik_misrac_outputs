  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in this routine. The rule specifically targets uses of standard string-handling functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn. The provided code performs character-wise processing using pointer dereferences and the isasciidigit helper, but it does not invoke any <string.h> APIs that could cause accesses beyond the bounds of objects via their pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments relevant to Rule 21.17 to investigate here. (Note: while pointer dereferences like str[0], *str and the final assignment *out_val should be reviewed for general safety and precondition guarantees in a broader safety/security review, they are not subject to MISRA Rule 21.17 because they are not uses of <string.h> string-handling functions.)"
