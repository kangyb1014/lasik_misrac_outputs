  "explanation": "I have only flagged a small set of operations that may be superfluous or worth inspection for potential dead-code concerns (casts and the final cast of the pointer-difference). Everything else in the function is directly tied to the function's observable behaviour and therefore should NOT be treated as dead code: the initial null/is-digit guard prevents incorrect parsing and is essential; the do/while loop, the res initialization and subsequent multiply/accumulate operations, the str++ and loop-condition test, the overflow check logic, the assignment to *out_val and the return of the parsed length are all necessary to implement correct parsing, overflow detection and to produce the function outputs. Removing any of those would change program behaviour, so they do not meet the definition of dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
