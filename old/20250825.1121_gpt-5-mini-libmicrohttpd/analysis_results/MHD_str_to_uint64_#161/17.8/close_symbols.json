  "explanation": "str: The MISRA rule concerns modification of function parameters. The analysis must know the exact declaration of 'str' (const char *str \u2014 pointer to const char, not a const pointer) because the code performs the operation 'str++'. Determining whether this is a prohibited modification requires knowing that the pointer itself is not declared const. out_val: Although the object pointed to by a pointer parameter may be modified, the pointer itself shall not. The declaration of 'out_val' (uint64_t *out_val) is needed to confirm that only '*out_val' is written and that the pointer variable 'out_val' is not modified. start: The local 'start' is initialized from 'str' (const char *const start = str) and later 'str - start' is returned. Including 'start' clarifies that the function intentionally advances the parameter variable 'str' (it is compared/subtracted against the saved start), which is relevant to conclude whether the parameter was modified. isasciidigit: This callee (or macro) is invoked with '*str' and in the control loop condition. To be thorough, the analysis must see the declaration or macro expansion of isasciidigit to ensure it does not have side effects that could modify 'str' (for example, if it were a macro that evaluated its argument with side effects)."
