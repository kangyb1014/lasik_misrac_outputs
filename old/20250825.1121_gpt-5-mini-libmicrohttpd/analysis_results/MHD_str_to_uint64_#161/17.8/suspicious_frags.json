  "explanation": "Only modifications of a function parameter itself (the pointer variable) are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The assignment through the pointer parameter (*out_val = res) modifies the object pointed to by out_val, which is permitted by the rule. The initialization const char *const start = str merely copies the pointer value into a local const pointer and does not modify the parameter. Other uses of str (reading via str[0], dereferencing *str, passing it to isasciidigit, and pointer subtraction (str - start) for the return value) do not modify the parameter variable itself. Therefore they do not need investigation under Rule 17.8."
