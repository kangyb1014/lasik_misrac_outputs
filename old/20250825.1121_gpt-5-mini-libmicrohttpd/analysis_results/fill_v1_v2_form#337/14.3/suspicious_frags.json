  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the supplied function are invariant. Rule 14.3 targets loop/conditional controlling expressions that are constant at compile/run time. In this function there are only runtime-dependent conditionals: \"if (NULL == reply)\", \"if (NULL == response)\", and \"if (MHD_YES != MHD_add_response_header(...))\" \u2014 each depends on the result of malloc, a function call, or MHD_add_response_header, so they are not invariant. There are no for/while/do-while loops or switch controlling expressions in the function, and no constant controlling expressions (the SECOND_PAGE macro is a format string, not a control expression). Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
