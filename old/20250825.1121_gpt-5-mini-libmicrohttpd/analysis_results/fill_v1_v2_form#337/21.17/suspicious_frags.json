  "explanation": "Only code that invokes string.h functions or passes pointers to buffers that will be read by other APIs (potentially beyond intended content length) are reported. The macro SECOND_PAGE is a compile-time string literal (no string.h invocation) and so is not itself suspicious. Calls such as add_session_cookie, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response and fprintf do not use <string.h> functions and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17. The (void) cls; line is only to silence an unused parameter warning and does not involve string handling. All other lines in the function do not perform string handling or buffer-size calculations and so need not be investigated for Rule 21.17. The reported fragments cover: (a) the strlen() uses that compute slen, (b) the malloc that allocates the buffer based on slen, (c) the snprintf that writes into the allocated buffer using SECOND_PAGE and the session strings, and (d) the creation of the response that uses slen as the buffer length \u2014 these are the sites where out-of-bounds accesses, wrong length calculations, integer overflow, or NULL-pointer use in string handling could arise and therefore should be investigated."
