  "explanation": "Agent A's assessment is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointer types to be const-qualified when the pointed-to objects are not modified. In fill_v1_v2_form the members session->value_1 and session->value_2 are only read (passed to snprintf) and not modified, so if those members are declared as non-const (char *), that would violate Rule 8.13. If the struct Session already declares them as const char * (or if they are arrays rather than pointers), then there is no violation. Note also that a complementary fix is to make the function parameter itself const (const struct Session *session) so the read-only intent is expressed locally, but the fundamental issue is the qualification of the session members. If those members must be written elsewhere, then they cannot be const and no violation occurs in that case."
