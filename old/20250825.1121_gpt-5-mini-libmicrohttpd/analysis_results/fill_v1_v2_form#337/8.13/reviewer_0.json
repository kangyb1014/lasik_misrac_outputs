The correct approach is to declare them as const char *value_1 (and const char *value_2) if they are not meant to be modified.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the scenario they describe, but the conclusion is conditional on the declaration/usage of the struct members. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 says pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible. In this function the session->value_1 and session->value_2 are only read (passed to strlen and snprintf, both taking const char *), so if struct Session actually declares these members as plain char * and they are not modified anywhere else in the program, that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and they should be declared as const char * instead. If, however, those members are written to elsewhere (or must be non-const for some other justified reason), then there is no violation. In short: the agent\u2019s report is correct as a potential violation given the stated struct declaration; the code shown alone is insufficient to decide definitively without seeing the struct definition and its uses."
