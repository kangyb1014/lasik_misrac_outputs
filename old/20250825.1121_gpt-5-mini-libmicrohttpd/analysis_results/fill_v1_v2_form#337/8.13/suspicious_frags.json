  "explanation": "Fragments not listed are not suspicious for Rule 8.13: 'const void *cls' and 'const char *mime' are already const-qualified. The local buffer 'reply' is written to (malloc + snprintf) so it must be a non-const char *; making it const would be incorrect. The 'response' object is created and later passed to library functions that manage and modify it (and is destroyed), so const-qualifying that pointer is not appropriate. Calls that pass 'mime' use an already const-qualified pointer. Other non-pointer or non-input-only uses (slen, return values, (void) cls) are not relevant to pointer const-qualification."
