  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The only use of the parameters is: (void) cls to silence an unused-parameter warning (this does not modify cls); reading session->value_1 and session->value_2 (modifying the object pointed to by session would be allowed by the rule, and here they are only read); passing pointers (mime, session, connection) to other functions (passing a pointer as an argument is not a modification of the parameter variable itself). The local pointer reply is allocated and passed (cast to void*) to an API; that is a local variable, not a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no fragments need further investigation for this rule."
