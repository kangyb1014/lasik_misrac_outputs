  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to check MISRA C 'controlling expressions shall not be invariant':\n\n1) MHD_monotonic_msec_counter\n   - The function sets 'now' used to compute 'since_actv'. To decide whether the if-expressions (timeout < since_actv, since_actv == timeout, UINT64_MAX/2 < since_actv, etc.) can ever vary at runtime we must know the semantic/implementation of this function (does it always return a compile-time constant or truly varying monotonic value, can it be inlined to a constant, or is it a stub that returns a fixed value?). Its behaviour determines whether 'since_actv' is invariant.\n\n2) struct MHD_Connection (definition: types and qualifiers of last_activity and connection_timeout_ms)\n   - The function reads c->last_activity and c->connection_timeout_ms. We need the exact declarations (types, signed/unsigned, volatile/const qualifiers, and whether fields are modifiable) to reason if these members are constant/invariant within this call. If, for example, connection_timeout_ms were defined as a constant or last_activity marked const/immutable, the controlling expressions might be invariant. Also correct typing (e.g. uint64_t) is required to reason about unsigned wrap-around semantics used in computations.\n\n3) MHD_update_last_activity_\n   - This or other updater functions may be invoked concurrently (in other threads) to change c->last_activity. To determine whether the controlling expressions are truly non-invariant at runtime we must know whether last_activity can be modified asynchronously (and whether it is protected/atomic). Inspecting the updater function(s) shows whether last_activity can change between reads and therefore whether expressions depending on it are non-constant.\n\n4) uint64_t (typedef)\n   - Precise integer type semantics (width, unsigned behaviour) are needed to analyse expressions such as now - c->last_activity, c->last_activity - now, and comparisons with UINT64_MAX / 2. MISRA analysis requires confirmation these are not compile-time constant expressions and to reason about underflow/wrap behaviour.\n\n5) UINT64_MAX (macro)\n   - The code uses UINT64_MAX/2 in a controlling expression. The exact value and its type (from headers) are needed to evaluate whether that comparison can be invariant and to reason about wrap-around and ordered comparisons in unsigned arithmetic.\n\n6) mhd_assert (macro)\n   - Although mhd_assert is not a controlling expression here, its definition may expand to code that affects control flow (e.g. abort, conditional compilation) or visibility of constants. To be safe, inspect the macro to ensure it does not transform the code into an invariant controlling expression or otherwise alter the control-flow assumptions.\n\nNotes: Other callers in the static call graph (thread_main_handle_connection, MHD_get_timeout64, etc.) are not required to decide whether the controlling expressions inside connection_get_wait are invariant, except to the extent they call or modify the same connection fields. MHD_update_last_activity_ was included specifically to capture possible concurrent modification. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether the controlling expressions in connection_get_wait can be considered invariant at compile time or are runtime-varying (and thus whether the MISRA rule is respected or an exception applies)."
