  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and the related definitions for compiler-specific language extensions. I found no uses of compiler extensions that are explicitly documented as such (for example: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __declspec, inline asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), GNU statement expressions, __builtin_* constructs, or other non-standard keywords). The code uses standard types (uint64_t, bool), standard preprocessor conditionals, and platform-specific API calls (clock_gettime, GetTickCount64, QueryPerformanceCounter, mach clock functions, gettimeofday/gethrtime) \u2014 these are OS/library APIs, not language/compiler extensions. The mhd_assert macro is a normal macro expansion ((void)0). The use of literal constants, if (1)/if (0) constructs, and preprocessor guards are standard C idioms, not extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions detected)."
