  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Connection (definition): You must see the full structure layout and the declarations/qualifiers of members accessed (c->last_activity, c->connection_timeout_ms). The MISRA rule concerns whether the pointer parameter can/should be 'const struct MHD_Connection *'. That decision depends on whether any accessed members are declared volatile/const or whether any operations require a non-const pointer (e.g. writes).  \n\n2) mhd_assert (macro or function definition): The assertion macro/function could expand to code that writes to or casts the pointer, or otherwise requires a non-const pointer. To be sure connection_get_wait does not perform any hidden modifications via mhd_assert, you need its definition.  \n\n3) MHD_monotonic_msec_counter (prototype/definition): Although this call does not take 'c' in the shown code, verify that it does not indirectly require or mutate the connection object or rely on special side-effects that would prevent making the parameter const. Confirming its prototype/behavior removes any doubt about hidden uses of 'c'.  \n\n4) prototypes / call-sites of connection_get_wait (if any external declarations): If there is an external prototype or other declarations (non-static) that disagree in qualification, changing the parameter to const may cause a declaration/definition mismatch. Verify any declarations to ensure adding const is compatible.  \n\n5) prototypes / call-sites of callers: thread_main_handle_connection and MHD_get_timeout64: Examine how callers invoke connection_get_wait (and whether they expect to pass a const or non-const pointer). While callers can pass a non-const pointer to a function taking a const parameter, you should still check call-sites and translation-unit-level declarations for ABI/signature consistency and to detect any implicit casts or patterns that would be affected by adding const.  \n\nCollecting these symbols allows a precise determination whether the pointer parameter can be safely and conformingly made const under MISRA (no hidden writes, casts or declaration mismatches)."
