  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct that a const qualification is missing, but the precise locus of the problem is the function parameter, not just the local variable. connection_get_wait() only reads fields of the connection object and therefore its parameter should be declared as pointing to const (e.g. const struct MHD_Connection *c). Only after changing the function prototype to accept a const pointer could local variables such as earliest_tmot_conn be declared as const. As written, earliest_tmot_conn cannot be made const without either (a) changing the callee prototype or (b) inserting a cast that discards const (which would itself be non\u2011compliant). So the report that Rule 8.13 is violated (missing const qualification) is correct in substance, but the actionable fix is to change connection_get_wait\u2019s parameter to a pointer-to-const and then change callers (including making earliest_tmot_conn const) rather than only changing the local variable."
