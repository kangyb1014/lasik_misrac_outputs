  "explanation": "I inspected all pointer usages in the provided functions and selected fragments where a pointer to a struct is declared or used but the code only reads members of the pointed-to object (no writes), i.e. candidates where the pointer target could reasonably be const-qualified per Rule 8.13. I did not include fragments that are not pointer-related or that clearly require a writable pointer: - The parameter uint64_t *timeout64 is written to in the function, so it must remain a non-const pointer and therefore is not suspicious. - Any scalar variables (now, since_actv, timeout, mseconds_left, earliest_deadline) and non-pointer expressions are not relevant to Rule 8.13. - Return statements and integer constant uses (e.g. UINT64_MAX, numeric literals) are not pointer-related. - Macros or calls that take the daemon pointer may internally require a non-const pointer; I only flagged the daemon parameter as a potential candidate because the shown code only reads daemon fields, but callers/macros outside the snippet might need it non-const \u2014 this should be checked by reviewers. - Member prevX and other pointer members were considered only insofar as they are used through the pos / earliest_tmot_conn variables, which I have listed. Reviewers should examine the flagged fragments to determine whether the pointed-to objects are ever modified (possibly through other aliases) before applying const qualifications."
