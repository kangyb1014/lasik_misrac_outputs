In the following code pos is only used to read members (pos->connection_timeout_ms, pos->last_activity, pos = pos->prevX) and is never used to modify the pointed-to object. Therefore pos could (and per Rule 8.13 should) be declared to point to a const-qualified type, e.g. \"const struct MHD_Connection *pos;\".

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The loop variable pos is only used for reading the list nodes, but it is assigned later into earliest_tmot_conn (earliest_tmot_conn = pos). earliest_tmot_conn and connection_get_wait expect a non-const struct MHD_Connection *; if pos were declared as const struct MHD_Connection * you would be implicitly discarding qualifiers when assigning pos to earliest_tmot_conn (and when passing to connection_get_wait). That conversion is not allowed without a cast or additional changes (e.g. making earliest_tmot_conn and connection_get_wait accept const), so in the current code pos cannot be made a pointer-to-const \u201cwithout further changes\u201d. Therefore, as written, this is not a straightforward violation of MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13."
