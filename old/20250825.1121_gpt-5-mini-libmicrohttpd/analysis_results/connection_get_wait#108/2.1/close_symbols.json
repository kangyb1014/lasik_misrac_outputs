  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: The function reads c->last_activity and c->connection_timeout_ms. You must know the exact field types and any invariants/constraints on these fields (e.g. whether connection_timeout_ms can be zero or constrained elsewhere) to decide whether branches (timeout == 0, timeout < since_actv, since_actv == timeout) can ever be taken.\\n- MHD_monotonic_msec_counter: The function\u2019s control flow depends on the numerical relationship between now and last_activity. You need the implementation/semantics (monotonicity, wrap/overflow behavior, possible jumps/backwards) to determine whether the wrap-detection branch and the jump_back computation can be reached.\\n- mhd_assert: The assert may affect whether the code following it can be treated as reachable/unreachable (for example it could abort at runtime or be a no-op depending on configuration). You need its definition to know if the assertion enforces that timeout != 0 at compile/run time or is removed.\\n- NDEBUG (or any macro controlling mhd_assert): If mhd_assert is a wrapper around the C assert or a macro that is disabled under a build flag, the presence/absence of that macro changes whether the assertion can make code paths unreachable; include the config macro(s) that control mhd_assert.\\n- connection_check_timedout: The source comment explicitly requires synchronization with this function. Its implementation may establish or rely on invariants about timing/fields that make branches here unreachable; compare both functions to judge whether some branches here can never occur.\\n- MHD_update_last_activity_: This function is a likely writer of c->last_activity (it appears in the call graph and interacts with the monotonic counter). Knowing when/how last_activity is set (and whether it can be set into the future) is necessary to determine if since_actv can be large/negative (wrap) or equal to timeout.\\n- UINT64_MAX: The check UINT64_MAX / 2 < since_actv depends on the exact width/value of UINT64_MAX. Include the constant (from stdint.h/limits) to ensure the overflow/wrap detection threshold is interpreted correctly.\\n\\nThese symbols together allow analysis of all conditions that control branching in connection_get_wait (monotonic time semantics, last_activity updates, assertion behavior and compile-time configuration). Without them you cannot soundly determine whether any branch or return statement in the function is provably unreachable under project semantics, which is required to check MISRA C's unreachable-code rule."
