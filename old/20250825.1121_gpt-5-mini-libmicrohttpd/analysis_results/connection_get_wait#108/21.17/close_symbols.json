  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection (definition): the function reads c->last_activity and c->connection_timeout_ms. We must know their types and layout (are they really uint64_t or pointers/arrays?) to rule out any hidden use of string functions or pointer-based accesses in this function.\n- MHD_monotonic_msec_counter (implementation): this is the only function called. If it (directly or indirectly) uses any <string.h> functions or does any pointer/array access that could go out of bounds, that could be relevant to the MISRA rule. Provide its body to verify it does not call string.h routines or perform unsafe memory accesses.\n- mhd_assert (macro / implementation): the macro invoked at function start could expand to code that uses string handling (e.g. logging/assert helpers) or pointer operations. Its definition is needed to ensure no string.h calls are introduced via the assert.\n- UINT64_MAX (macro definition): the function compares since_actv against UINT64_MAX/2; the exact value and type of the macro are needed to confirm the comparison semantics and rule out unintended type promotions or undefined behaviour that might lead to pointer/array misuse.\n- uint64_t typedef / stdint.h integer-width guarantees: to confirm wrap/overflow semantics of the subtractions and comparisons (e.g. now - c->last_activity) and to ensure no hidden pointer casts or aliasing that could involve string operations.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether connection_get_wait itself (or the single callee it invokes, or the assert macro it uses) employs any <string.h> functions or performs pointer/array accesses that could violate the MISRA string-handling bounds rule."
