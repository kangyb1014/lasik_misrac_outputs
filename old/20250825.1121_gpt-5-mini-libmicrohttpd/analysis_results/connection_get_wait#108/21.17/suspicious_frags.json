  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in this function. The function performs only integer arithmetic on uint64_t fields of the passed-in struct (now, since_actv, timeout, mseconds_left) and contains control flow and returns; there are no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn (or any other string-handling routine) and no operations that take pointer/array length parameters for such functions. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
