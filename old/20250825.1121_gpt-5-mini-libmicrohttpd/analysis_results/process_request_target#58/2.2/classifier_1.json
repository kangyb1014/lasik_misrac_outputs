The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_request_target:\n```c\nstatic bool\nprocess_request_target (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n  size_t params_len;\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING == c->state);\n  mhd_assert (NULL == c->rq.url);\n  mhd_assert (0 == c->rq.url_len);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt);\n  mhd_assert ((NULL == c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt_qmark) || \\\n              (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt <= c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt_qmark));\n  mhd_assert ((NULL == c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt_qmark) || \\\n              (c->rq.req_target_len > \\\n               (size_t) (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt_qmark \\\n                         - c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt)));\n\n  /* Log callback before the request-target is modified/decoded */\n  if (NULL != c->daemon->uri_log_callback)\n  {\n    c->rq.client_aware = true;\n    c->rq.client_context =\n      c->daemon->uri_log_callback (c->daemon->uri_log_callback_cls,\n                                   c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt,\n                                   c);\n  }\n\n  if (NULL != c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt_qmark)\n  {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n    params_len =\n      c->rq.req_target_len\n      - (size_t) (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt_qmark - c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt);\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n    c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt_qmark[0] = 0; /* Replace '?' with zero termination */\n    if (MHD_NO == MHD_parse_arguments_ (c,\n                                        MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND,\n                                        c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt_qmark + 1,\n                                        &connection_add_header,\n                                        c))\n    {\n      mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVING != c->state);\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n  else\n    params_len = 0;\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n\n  mhd_assert (strlen (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt) == \\\n              c->rq.req_target_len - params_len);\n\n  /* Finally unescape URI itself */\n  c->rq.url_len =\n    c->daemon->unescape_callback (c->daemon->unescape_callback_cls,\n                                  c,\n                                  c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt);\n  c->rq.url = c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt;\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (strlen (c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt) == \\\n              c->rq.req_target_len - params_len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The mhd_assert call uses params_len which is only defined under _DEBUG and the whole assertion is a debug-time check. This is not dead code in the sense of MISRA 2.2 because the assertion (and the strlen() it contains) may affect program behaviour in debug builds (it can detect a violation/abort) and therefore its removal could change behaviour. In release builds the mhd_assert macro is normally defined to omit evaluation of its argument (e.g. #define mhd_assert(x) ((void)0)), so nothing executed and no dead code remains. Note: if mhd_assert were implemented such that its argument is still evaluated (or the macro does not remove the expression) in release, then the strlen(...) and use of params_len would be an operation that is executed but removable without effect (i.e. dead code) \u2014 that would violate Rule 2.2."
