  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The only parameter is 'struct MHD_Connection *connection', and it is only used as an argument in calls to MHD_queue_response; the pointer variable itself is not assigned to, incremented, decremented, or otherwise changed. Local variable 'ret' and global objects (mutex, cached_directory_response, internal_error_response) are accessed but are not function parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
