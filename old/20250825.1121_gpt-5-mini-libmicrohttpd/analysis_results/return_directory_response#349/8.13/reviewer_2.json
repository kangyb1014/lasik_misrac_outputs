There is no evidence the pointee is modified here, so these variables should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Response *') where possible. Therefore the current non-const pointer declarations violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function return_directory_response:\nstatic struct MHD_Response *cached_directory_response\n...\nstatic struct MHD_Response *internal_error_response\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "False. MISRA 8.13 is about the declarations: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type when it is possible to do so. The agent\u2019s report only inspects one use-site (reading and passing the pointer to MHD_queue_response) and does not consider the declaration site, other uses in the translation unit, or the API being called. In practice MHD_queue_response in libmicrohttpd accepts a non-const struct MHD_Response * (it may modify/platform-manage the response), and the static variables are likely initialized/managed elsewhere (created, modified or passed to APIs that require a mutable pointer). Making the declaration const would therefore be incompatible with those uses. Without evidence that the pointee is never modified and that all called APIs accept a pointer-to-const, you cannot conclude a violation. Hence the report is not correct."
