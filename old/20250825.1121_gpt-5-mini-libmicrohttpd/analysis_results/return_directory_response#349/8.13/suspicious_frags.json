  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer targets that could be const-qualified. The only non-const pointer targets present in this code that may be suitable for const-qualification are the MHD_Response pointers referenced above (their definitions and their use in the MHD_queue_response calls) and the function parameter that is a pointer type. Other fragments do not need investigation for this rule: the mutex is passed to pthread_mutex_lock and must be a mutable object (the lock operation modifies it), there are no other pointer variables in the function, the return type and local enum variable are non-pointer types, and the (void) casts are just to silence unused-result warnings. Therefore no additional fragments beyond the listed ones appear relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
