If the pointed-to object is not modified after initialization, the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. static const struct MHD_Response *internal_error_response). Therefore the current declaration violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If the API MHD_queue_response requires a non-const pointer, the correct fix is to change the API or initialization so the pointer genuinely must be mutable; otherwise leaving it non-const is a violation.)\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function return_directory_response:\nstatic struct MHD_Response *cached_directory_response\n...\nstatic struct MHD_Response *internal_error_response\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct as a definite MISRA 2023 Rule 8.13 violation for the shown code. Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Whether a pointer should be const depends on its actual usage across the translation unit and the APIs it is passed to. In this code the two static pointers shown (cached_directory_response and internal_error_response) are passed to MHD_queue_response. The libmicrohttpd API for MHD_queue_response takes a non-const struct MHD_Response * parameter, so declaring these pointers as pointers-to-const would make them incompatible with that API (or force a cast, which would be undesirable and could violate other MISRA rules). Also cached_directory_response looks like something that may be updated under the mutex elsewhere in the translation unit, so it is not necessarily possible to make it const. Therefore, on the evidence provided, it is not correct to assert a Rule 8.13 violation. If, however, a careful review of the whole translation unit proved that a pointer truly never points to a mutable object and is never passed to non-const APIs, then changing its declaration to point to const would be appropriate. Given the API usage and the likely mutability, the agent's claim is not supported here."
