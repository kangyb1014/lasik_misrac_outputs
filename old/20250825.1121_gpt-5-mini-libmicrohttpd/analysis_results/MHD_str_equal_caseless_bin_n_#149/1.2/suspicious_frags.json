  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of compiler language extensions in the provided code fragments. Rationale:\n\n- No compiler-specific keywords or builtins are present (no __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __extension__, __inline__/__forceinline, typeof, or other vendor-specific tokens).\n- The identifiers and types used are standard C: size_t, const, char, and bool (bool/_Bool is a standard C type since C99; its use is not a compiler extension). The expressions and operators (arithmetic on char, ternary operator, for loop, return of integer literal convertible to bool) are all standard C constructs.\n- The macro-like token _MHD_static_inline appears in the additional code, but its definition was not provided. As written here it is only a macro name; the fragments shown do not themselves use a documented compiler extension. If the actual definition of _MHD_static_inline expands to a compiler-specific extension (for example, __inline__ or a vendor attribute), that definition should be reviewed \u2014 but the provided snippets do not show such an expansion, so no fragment in the shown code can be flagged on the basis of an explicit extension.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied snippets that explicitly use documented compiler language extensions; nothing here needs to be investigated for Rule 1.2 based on the visible code. If you can provide the definition of _MHD_static_inline or any build-specific headers/macros, I can re-check those for hidden extensions."
