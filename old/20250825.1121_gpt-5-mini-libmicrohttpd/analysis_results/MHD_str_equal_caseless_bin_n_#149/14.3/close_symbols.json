  "explanation": "- charsequalcaseless: The for-loop controlling expression depends on i and len, and the loop body calls charsequalcaseless. To determine whether the controlling expression can be invariant (or be made invariant via side-effects), the analysis must inspect charsequalcaseless to ensure it has no side-effects that modify i or len (directly or via aliasing, global state, longjmp, etc.), and that it does not itself produce infinite-loop semantics that would rely on an invariant controlling expression. In short, charsequalcaseless must be checked for any side-effects or behaviours that could affect loop termination or make the controlling expression effectively invariant.  \n- isasciiupper: charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper (transitive callee). To be sure charsequalcaseless is free of side-effects relevant to the loop control, the implementation of isasciiupper must also be inspected (macros, functions, or locale/global-state interactions). Any side-effects or unusual behaviour in isasciiupper could affect the conclusion about the invariance of the loop controlling expression."
