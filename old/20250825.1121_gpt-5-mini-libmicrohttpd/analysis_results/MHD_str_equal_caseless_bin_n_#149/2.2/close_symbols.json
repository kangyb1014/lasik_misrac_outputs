  "explanation": "charsequalcaseless: The target function's behavior (loop iterations and the only early return) depends entirely on the result and possible side effects of charsequalcaseless. To decide whether any operations in MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ are dead (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) we must know if charsequalcaseless is pure (no side effects) or if it can mutate globals/volatile memory, perform I/O, longjmp/exit, set errno, or always return a constant for all inputs. Any of those change whether the loop/body is semantically required.\n\nisasciiupper: According to the static call graph charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper. isasciiupper\u2019s implementation or macro definition may itself have side effects or rely on locale/global state (or expand to other ctype functions/macros that have UB for negative char values). We must examine isasciiupper to determine whether it contributes side effects or control flow that would make the calls inside the loop non-dead.\n\nNote: when inspecting these symbols, also include any additional functions/macros they call (e.g., tolower/isupper/other ctype helpers or macros) because those could introduce side effects or undefined behaviour that affect whether removal of the calls in the target function would alter program behaviour."
