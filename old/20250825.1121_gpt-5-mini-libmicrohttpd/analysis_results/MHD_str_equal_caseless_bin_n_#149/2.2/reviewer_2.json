  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The continue statement is executed when charsequalcaseless(c1,c2) is true, but it has no effect on observable behaviour because control would fall out of the if and reach the loop increment and next iteration anyway. Removing the continue does not change program behaviour, so it qualifies as dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The provided helper functions show no side effects that would make the continue meaningful. Remedy: remove the continue (or rewrite as if (!charsequalcaseless(...)) return false;), or document a justified deviation."
