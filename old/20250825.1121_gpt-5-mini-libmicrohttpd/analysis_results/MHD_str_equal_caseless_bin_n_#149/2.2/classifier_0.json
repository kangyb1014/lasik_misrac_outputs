Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (const char *const str1,\n                               const char *const str2,\n                               size_t len)\n{\n  size_t i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)\n  {\n    const char c1 = str1[i];\n    const char c2 = str2[i];\n    if (charsequalcaseless (c1, c2))\n      continue;\n    else\n      return 0;\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_:\n_MHD_static_inline bool\ncharsequalcaseless (const char c1, const char c2)\n{\n  return ( (c1 == c2) ||\n           (isasciiupper (c1) ?\n            ((c1 - 'A' + 'a') == c2) :\n            ((c1 == (c2 - 'A' + 'a')) && isasciiupper (c2))) );\n}\n...\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nisasciiupper (char c)\n{\n  return (c >= 'A') && (c <= 'Z');\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The expression 'return ! 0;' is not dead code. It is executed to produce the function's return value (true) when the loop completes; removing the entire return statement would change program behaviour. Although '!0' is a constant expression equivalent to '1', evaluating it is part of producing the used return value and therefore not a dead operation under Rule 2.2. (A true violation would be an executed statement whose removal does not affect behaviour, e.g. an assignment to a variable that is never subsequently used.)"
