  "explanation": "No use of the standard library function memcmp is present in the provided code. MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ compares characters one-by-one using a length parameter (len) and the helper charsequalcaseless/isasciiupper functions; none of these call memcmp or other standard library comparison routines. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) to investigate in the supplied code. Note also that the function performs a bounded (length-based) comparison rather than an implicit null-terminated string comparison, so it does not fall under the prohibition even if the inputs happen to be null-terminated."
