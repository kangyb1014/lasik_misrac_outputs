This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- charsequalcaseless: The target loop delegates the per-character comparison to this helper. We must inspect its implementation to know whether it performs additional memory accesses (for example, calling other routines, reading past the single character, or expecting NUL-terminated strings) or itself calls any <string.h> functions. If this helper accesses outside the single character passed in or calls string.h routines, the MISRA rule could be implicated.\n- isasciiupper: The static call graph shows charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper. We need its definition (or macro expansion) to confirm it does not perform unsafe memory accesses or call string.h functions and to ensure it is used with correctly promoted/validated character values (avoiding undefined behaviour for negative signed-char values).\n- any functions/macros called by charsequalcaseless (e.g. tolower/toupper/isupper/isascii): If charsequalcaseless uses other ctype helpers or conversion macros, those symbols must be examined for possible out-of-bounds accesses or hidden calls into string-handling routines. Include each concrete symbol once you inspect charsequalcaseless.\n- all callers of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: To determine whether the loop indexing str1[i] and str2[i] up to len-1 can legally occur, the callers must be inspected to learn the provenance and guaranteed sizes/lengths of the buffers and the origin/constraints of the len argument. If callers ensure the buffers are at least len bytes long (or otherwise bound len), the function is safe; otherwise it may permit out-of-bounds reads.\n\nProvide the source/headers for the above symbols so the next analyst can determine whether any of these perform string.h operations or otherwise cause accesses beyond the referenced objects."
