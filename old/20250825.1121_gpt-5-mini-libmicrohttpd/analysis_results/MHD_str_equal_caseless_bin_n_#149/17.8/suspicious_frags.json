  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning:\n- The pointer parameters are declared as const char *const (str1, str2). The pointer itself is const (cannot be reassigned) and the pointed-to objects are const (cannot be modified through these pointers), so neither the pointer nor the objects are modified in this function.\n- The scalar parameter len is not modified anywhere in the function (only read in the loop condition). MISRA Rule 17.8 forbids modifying parameters; merely not declaring len const is not a violation if it is not modified.\n- All accesses to the strings are reads via indexing (str1[i], str2[i]) and assigned to local const char variables c1 and c2; these are local copies and do not modify the parameters or their pointees.\n- The call to charsequalcaseless passes char values (c1, c2) by value, so that call cannot modify the original parameters.\n- There are no assignments, increments/decrements, or pointer arithmetic applied to the parameter identifiers.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the provided function that violate or require investigation for Rule 17.8."
