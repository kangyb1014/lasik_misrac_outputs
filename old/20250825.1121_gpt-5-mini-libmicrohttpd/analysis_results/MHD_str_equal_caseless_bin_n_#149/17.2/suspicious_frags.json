  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The only functions present are:\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ which calls charsequalcaseless in its loop\n- charsequalcaseless which calls isasciiupper\n- isasciiupper which performs direct character comparisons\nCall graph: MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ -> charsequalcaseless -> isasciiupper. There are no self-calls and no cycles (no indirect/mutual recursion). No function pointers, macros, or other constructs are present that could introduce hidden indirect recursion. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
