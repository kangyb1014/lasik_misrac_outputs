  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ participates in direct or indirect recursion you must examine every function it calls (and the functions they call) to see if any path leads back to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_.\n\n- charsequalcaseless: This is a direct callee of the target. Its implementation must be inspected for any calls (direct or indirect) that might eventually call back into MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (or into any function that would form a cycle including the target).\n\n- isasciiupper: According to the static call graph, charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper. You must inspect isasciiupper as well to ensure it does not call (directly or indirectly) back to the target. Although isasciiupper is often a simple macro or small helper, it could be project-defined; its body is required to rule out an indirect recursion path.\n\nNo other symbols are required given the provided call graph, because there are no other callees reachable from the target according to the graph; if additional callees are discovered in the implementations above, those would need to be added for further analysis."
