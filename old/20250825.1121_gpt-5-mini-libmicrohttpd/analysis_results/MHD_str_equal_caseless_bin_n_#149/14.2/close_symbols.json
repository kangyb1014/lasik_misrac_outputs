Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "charsequalcaseless: This function is called directly from inside the for-loop body. MISRA requires that the behaviour of any function called within the loop body be considered part of the loop body when checking that the loop counter and any objects used in the for-clauses are not modified and that no persistent side-effects occur. You must inspect charsequalcaseless to confirm it:\n- does not modify the loop counter 'i' or any other object used in the for clauses (here: 'len'),\n- does not modify objects that the second or third clause depend on (e.g. global variables referenced in the second/third clause),\n- does not perform persistent side-effects (modify global or static state, I/O, etc.) that would violate the \u2018no persistent side-effects\u2019 requirement,\n- does not modify memory pointed to by str1 or str2 in a way that would affect the for-clauses.\n\nisasciiupper: The static call graph shows charsequalcaseless calls isasciiupper. Since called functions\u2019 behaviour is included in the loop body, you must inspect isasciiupper as well to ensure it is side-effect-free and does not modify any objects used in the for-clauses or global/static state. In short, both symbols are required so you can determine whether any side-effects or object modifications occurring inside the loop body (directly or indirectly) would make the for-loop violate the MISRA well-formedness requirements."
