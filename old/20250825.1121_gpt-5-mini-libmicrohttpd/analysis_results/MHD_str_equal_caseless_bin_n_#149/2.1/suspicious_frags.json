  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the supplied code. Rationale:\n\n- In MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: the for loop can complete normally (leading to the final return !0) when all character pairs satisfy charsequalcaseless, and it can exit early via return 0 when any pair does not match. The if/else inside the loop depends on runtime data (the characters of the strings), so both the continue path and the return path are reachable for different inputs. There is no code after a guaranteed unconditional return that would be unreachable.\n\n- In charsequalcaseless: the conditional operator selects one of two runtime-evaluated expressions depending on isasciiupper(c1). Whether isasciiupper(c1) is true or false depends on the runtime value of c1 (both cases are possible), so neither branch is statically unreachable. Within the second branch, the && operator may short-circuit, but that is standard conditional evaluation, not unreachable code.\n\n- In isasciiupper: the return expression is a runtime boolean expression depending on the value of c; both true and false outcomes are possible, so no part of the function is unreachable.\n\nNo constructs (constant conditions, always-taken/never-taken branches, or code after guaranteed returns) were found that would produce unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1 in the provided fragments."
