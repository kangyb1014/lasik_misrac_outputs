  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found w.r.t. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning:\n\n- The two pointer parameters of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ are declared as const char *const str1 and const char *const str2. This means both the pointer and the pointee are const-qualified (pointer-to-const and the pointer itself is const), satisfying the rule requirement that a pointer point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n- All accesses to the pointed data use indexing (str1[i], str2[i]) and those values are assigned to const char local variables (const char c1, const char c2), preserving const qualification of the pointees.\n- The helper routines shown (charsequalcaseless and isasciiupper) take their arguments by value (char), not by pointer, so Rule 8.13 (about pointer pointees) does not apply to them.\n- The function returns a bool (no pointer return), and there are no other pointer variables, pointer arithmetic, or non-const pointer parameters present in the provided code.\n\nTherefore, within the provided code fragments there are no pointers that lack const qualification and nothing that needs further investigation for Rule 8.13. (If there are other related code fragments not shown that introduce non-const pointers used with these functions, those would need review, but none are present in the supplied code.)"
