  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are direct writes to elements of the header buffer (e.g. header[0] = 0; header[0] = 'D'; ... header[35] = '\\r'; header[36] = '\\n'; header[37] = 0;). These clearly modify the object pointed to by header, so making the pointer-to-object const would be inappropriate and need not be investigated for Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer parameters or pointer variables in this function to consider. The only items that could potentially violate Rule 8.13 (and thus warrant investigation) are the function parameter declaration and the call that takes header + 6, because the const-qualification of the target of that pointer depends on whether the callee (get_date_str) or callers treat the buffer as mutable or not."
