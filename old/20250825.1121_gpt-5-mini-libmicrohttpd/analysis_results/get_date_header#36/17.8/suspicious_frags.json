  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 were found. The rule prohibits modifying the pointer parameter itself (e.g. assignments like header = ..., increments header++, or similar). In this function: \n- There is no assignment or modification of the pointer variable header. \n- The call get_date_str(header + 6) computes and passes an address expression but does not modify header. Passing header + 6 as an argument does not change the parameter. \n- All other operations are writes to the object pointed to by header (header[0], header[1], ..., header[37]), which is explicitly allowed by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). \nTherefore, with respect to Rule 17.8, there are no code fragments that require investigation."
