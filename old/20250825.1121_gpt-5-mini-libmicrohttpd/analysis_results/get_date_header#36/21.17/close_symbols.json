  "explanation": "To determine whether get_date_header could access memory beyond the bounds of the object pointed to by 'header' (and to check misuse of <string.h> functions), the analyzer needs: \n\n1) get_date_str: this is called with header + 6 and is responsible for writing the date characters (and likely a NUL). You must inspect its implementation to know how many bytes it writes and whether it uses string.h functions that might overrun the buffer.\n\n2) MHD_uint8_to_str_pad and MHD_uint16_to_str: these are callees of get_date_str. They may write into the buffer passed down from get_date_str; their maximum writes and any string.h usages determine the total bytes written into header+6.\n\n3) build_header_response: this caller constructs or obtains the 'header' buffer passed into get_date_header. You must inspect this function to find where 'header' comes from and any contracts about its minimum size.\n\n4) header buffer allocation/definition site in build_header_response: the exact variable/alloc call (stack array or malloc) and the allocated size are required to check whether indices written by get_date_header (0..5 and 35..37) and the bytes written by get_date_str into header+6 fit within the allocated object.\n\n5) any macros/constants that define the expected date/header lengths (for example an HTTP date length constant): these show the intended buffer sizing and help verify whether the hardcoded indices (35,36,37) are safe.\n\n6) any uses of <string.h> functions inside get_date_str, MHD_uint8_to_str_pad, MHD_uint16_to_str or in build_header_response: MISRA rule specifically targets these functions, so you must locate and review their usages (which functions, with what destination buffer and maximum copy lengths) to prove there is no out-of-bounds write.\n\nTogether these symbols let you compute the maximum number of bytes written into the object referenced by 'header' and confirm whether get_date_header (and its callees) perform any string.h operations that could overrun that object."
