  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- get_date_str\n  - Direct callee of get_date_header. You must inspect its implementation to know whether calling it has observable side effects (beyond filling header+6) or whether it can always fail/succeed; this determines whether get_date_header is ever functionally required and thus whether its body is dead code.\n\n- MHD_uint8_to_str_pad\n  - Callee of get_date_str (per the static graph). It may perform writes or formatting that produce observable effects; its behavior can affect whether removal of get_date_header (and thus removing the call chain) changes program behaviour.\n\n- MHD_uint16_to_str\n  - Also called by get_date_str (and by build_header_response). Needed to see side effects and whether numeric-to-string conversion used by the date logic is observable; also to check if its use elsewhere ties get_date_header into required behaviour.\n\n- build_header_response\n  - The direct caller of get_date_header. To determine if get_date_header is dead you must see how build_header_response uses the header buffer produced (e.g., whether the header bytes set by get_date_header are actually appended/emitted). Also inspect control flow in build_header_response to decide whether get_date_header is reachable in normal execution.\n\n- buffer_append\n  - Used by build_header_response to place headers into the outgoing buffer. If build_header_response appends the header written by get_date_header, removing get_date_header would change program output; if not, get_date_header may be dead. Inspecting buffer_append use is required to judge observable effect.\n\n- add_user_headers\n  - Another header-related callee of build_header_response. It may interact with or overwrite the same output area; you must check ordering/overlap to determine whether the bytes written by get_date_header are ever used or are overwritten (which would make them dead code).\n\n- transmit_error_response_len\n  - A caller of build_header_response. Include it to establish higher-level reachability: whether the path that calls build_header_response (and thus get_date_header) is reachable from program entry points or error-handling paths. If upstream callers are never invoked, get_date_header could be dead.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle\n  - Another caller of build_header_response. Same reasoning as transmit_error_response_len: needed to determine overall reachability and runtime conditions under which get_date_header would execute.\n\nNote: The above set is minimal to decide (a) whether get_date_header is ever reached at runtime, and (b) whether the writes it performs produce observable effects (are appended, read, or otherwise affect behavior). You will need to read the implementations of these symbols (especially build_header_response and get_date_str and the buffer append/consumer code) to conclude whether get_date_header constitutes dead code under the MISRA rule."
