Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n1) get_date_str\n- get_date_header directly calls get_date_str. MISRA's rule treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the for-loop body if a for loop exists in the calling function. Even though get_date_header itself contains no for loop, to be sure it cannot violate the rule (for example via inlined or macro-expanded loops, or if further analysis considers transformations), we must inspect get_date_str for any for loops, loop counters, side effects on objects (e.g. the header buffer passed as header+6), or modifications to objects that would be used in a for clause.\n\n2) MHD_uint8_to_str_pad\n- get_date_str (from the call graph) calls MHD_uint8_to_str_pad. If get_date_str contains or delegates loop work to this function, that function may contain for loops or modify objects visible to get_date_header. We must examine it to ensure any for loops it contains are well-formed per MISRA (single loop counter, no modifications of loop-controlled objects in body, no persistent side effects in the second clause, etc.).\n\n3) MHD_uint16_to_str\n- Both get_date_str and build_header_response call MHD_uint16_to_str according to the call graph. As above, any for loops inside MHD_uint16_to_str (or side effects it produces) could be relevant when reasoning about loop correctness in the call chain. We need its body/prototype to see whether it modifies objects used as loop counters or has persistent side effects that would violate clause 2.\n\n4) bool (definition / stdbool.h)\n- MISRA's definition of a \"loop control flag\" depends on the type being a Boolean type. To determine whether any identifier used for loop control in the functions above qualifies, and whether code uses a proper Boolean type, we need the definition of bool (or the project's Boolean type). This is necessary to assess clause 1/2/4 concerning loop control flags and loop-counter types.\n\nNotes:\n- No other symbols from the static call graph (e.g., build_header_response) are required for analyzing get_date_header for this MISRA rule unless those functions are directly called inside a for loop in get_date_header (they are not). The focus is the called-function chain starting at get_date_str because the MISRA rule includes called functions in the loop-body behaviour."
