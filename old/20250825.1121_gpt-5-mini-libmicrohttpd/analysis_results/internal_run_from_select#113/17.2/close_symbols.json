  "explanation": "To determine whether internal_run_from_select violates the MISRA rule forbidding direct or indirect self-calls, the analysis must follow all call paths out of internal_run_from_select and check whether any of those paths (through callee\u2192callee chains) can reach internal_run_from_select (or its callers). Each listed symbol is required because it is either called directly by internal_run_from_select in the presented code, is a direct callee of one of those callees, or is a likely caller/target in a path that could form an indirect recursion back to internal_run_from_select or to its callers (MHD_run_from_select2 / MHD_select). Brief rationale for each symbol: \n\n- new_connections_list_process_: directly called by internal_run_from_select; must inspect its callees for paths back. \n- new_connection_process_: callee of new_connections_list_process_; may call connection-add/dispatch code that could indirectly call back. \n- MHD_DLOG: logging function called by several callees; include to be sure it does not call back. \n- MHD_accept_connection: directly called when listening socket ready; inspect its callees for callbacks into run/select paths. \n- MHD_socket_nonblocking_: callee of MHD_accept_connection; include to rule out unexpected callbacks. \n- MHD_socket_noninheritable_: callee of MHD_accept_connection; include for the same reason. \n- internal_add_connection: callee of MHD_accept_connection; likely to register new connections and possibly call other daemon APIs that could lead back to run_from_select. \n- MHD_add_connection: related API that may be invoked by internal_add_connection or other connection-path code; include because it appears elsewhere in the static graph and could be part of a recursion path. \n- call_handlers: directly called by internal_run_from_select to process each connection; its callees must be inspected. \n- MHD_connection_handle_read: one of call_handlers' callees; could invoke scheduling or daemon APIs that eventually re-enter run/select. \n- MHD_connection_handle_idle: same rationale as read handler. \n- MHD_connection_handle_write: same rationale as read handler. \n- MHD_connection_close_: connection-close routine; close code often drives cleanup or scheduling that might call back into cleanup/run paths. \n- MHD_cleanup_connections: directly called at end of internal_run_from_select; its callees may perform actions (destroy/pool/ip-limit) that could call back. \n- cleanup_upgraded_connection: callee of MHD_cleanup_connections; include because upgraded-connection cleanup may resume or finish connections. \n- MHD_pool_destroy: resource-destruction routine called from cleanup; include to ensure no recursion via destructor hooks. \n- MHD_ip_limit_del: IP limit bookkeeping called during cleanup; include for completeness. \n- MHD_destroy_response: response-destruction called from cleanup; include to ensure no callbacks into run/select. \n- MHD_run_from_select2: listed as a caller of internal_run_from_select; include because recursion can be indirect via a path that calls this routine (i.e., internal_run_from_select -> ... -> MHD_run_from_select2 -> internal_run_from_select). \n- MHD_select: another caller of internal_run_from_select; any callee that can call MHD_select creates an indirect recursion risk. \n- resume_suspended_connections: called by MHD_select / MHD_run_from_select2 (in static graph); include because a callee might call this and it could re-enter select/run paths. \n- MHD_itc_clear_: used in ITC clearing above; include in case it triggers callbacks into daemon code. \n- MHD_itc_r_fd_: used to get ITC fd; include to be sure no hidden re-entrancy. \n- MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_: used to test ITC validity; include for completeness in the ITC handling path. \n- MHD_SCKT_FD_FITS_FDSET_SETSIZE_: used to decide FD_SET checks; include because it affects which branches are taken and thus which callees are invoked. \n- MHD_connection_finish_forward_: called when URH forwarding finishes (HTTPS+UPGRADE path); include because it calls into connection lifecycle routines that can schedule/resume/cleanup. \n- MHD_resume_connection: called after marking upgraded connection clean; resuming could enqueue the connection and potentially trigger code paths that re-enter run/select. \n- urh_from_fdset: HTTPS/upgrade helper that updates state from fd_sets; include since it is invoked from internal_run_from_select in the HTTPS/UPGRADE block. \n- process_urh: forwarding processing for upgraded responses; include because it can call connection lifecycle functions.\n\nIn short: include every direct callee and their relevant callees (and the known callers MHD_run_from_select2 / MHD_select and resume_suspended_connections) so the next agent can examine each function's body/call graph and determine whether any path leads back to internal_run_from_select (directly or indirectly)."
