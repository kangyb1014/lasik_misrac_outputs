  "explanation": "Only function calls can introduce direct or indirect recursion per MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2. The three code fragments listed are the only function-call expressions present in the provided code (the call from process_param__timeout to get_param_value, the call from get_param_value to mhd_tool_str_to_uint, and the call to fprintf). All other fragments (variable declarations, assignments such as tool_params.timeout = param_value;, return statements, conditionals, and literal/enum returns) do not perform function calls and therefore cannot by themselves create direct or indirect self-calls and do not need investigation for Rule 17.2. Note: the listed fragments should be inspected to ensure none of the called functions (including external/helpers like mhd_tool_str_to_uint or any implementation of fprintf hooks) call back into these functions, which could create indirect recursion."
