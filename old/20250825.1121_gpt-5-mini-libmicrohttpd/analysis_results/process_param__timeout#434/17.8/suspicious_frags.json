  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The parameters (const char *param_name, const char *param_tail, const char *next_param) are only passed to get_param_value and are not assigned to, incremented, or otherwise modified; their const qualification further indicates the function does not alter the pointed-to objects. The only pointer passed for modification is &param_value (address of a local variable), which is permitted because the rule allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter (here the callee may write into the provided storage), and that object is a local, not a function parameter. The assignment to tool_params.timeout affects a global structure member, not any function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
