The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- get_param_value: The target function calls get_param_value; any for-loops in get_param_value (or effects of its body) count toward the MISRA for-loop rule for the target call. We need the full definition to inspect for/loop headers, loop counters, loop control flags, and side effects inside the loop body (including functions called from those loops).\n- mhd_tool_str_to_uint: get_param_value calls this function according to the static call graph. If mhd_tool_str_to_uint contains for-loops (or modifies objects used as loop counters in its callers), those loops must be inspected. Full definition/prototype required.\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result: The target function returns and compares values of this enum (PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR). Having the enum definition clarifies control flow and whether special enum values imply calls/loops or side effects in macros.\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR: The comparison against this identifier affects early return and therefore whether any subsequent code (including loops) executes. Need its definition (enumerator or macro) to understand control flow precisely.\n- tool_params (declaration and its type): The target assigns to tool_params.timeout. While this assignment is not a for-loop, the MISRA rule forbids loop counters being modified in loop bodies; if any loop in callees references or modifies members of tool_params, we must detect that. Knowing the type and declaration lets us detect uses of its members as loop counters or side-effected objects.\n- all functions and global objects referenced by get_param_value and mhd_tool_str_to_uint: The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of a loop body as including behaviour of any functions called within that statement. To be sound we must inspect any further callees or globals used by those functions (their prototypes and full definitions/bodies) to find for-loops and to see which objects are modified or used as loop counters.\n\nProvide these symbols (prototypes and full source bodies where applicable) to the next analyzer so it can locate and check every for-statement and verify the three clauses, identify loop counters/flags, and ensure no forbidden side effects or modifications occur in loop bodies."
