  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n1) get_param_value (declaration + implementation)\n   - The target function directly calls get_param_value with the three string pointers (param_name, param_tail, next_param). To determine whether any string.h functions are used and whether those uses access beyond the supplied buffers, you must inspect get_param_value's code: how it reads/parses the input strings, whether it calls strlen/strcpy/strncmp/etc., and how it handles boundaries and null-termination.\n\n2) mhd_tool_str_to_uint (declaration + implementation)\n   - get_param_value calls mhd_tool_str_to_uint (per the static call graph). If mhd_tool_str_to_uint performs string parsing or uses string.h APIs, it could be the site of out-of-bounds accesses. Its implementation is required to trace any string operations and validate bounds checking.\n\n3) enum PerfRepl_param_result and PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR (definition)\n   - The target function branches on the PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR value returned by get_param_value. Knowing the exact enum values and semantics is necessary to reason about which code paths execute (e.g., whether the error path avoids further use of strings) and to ensure correct interpretation of return values during analysis.\n\n4) tool_params and its struct/type declaration (definition of timeout member)\n   - The function writes param_value into tool_params.timeout. While this is an integer assignment (not a string operation), checking the type and declaration ensures there is no hidden string/buffer stored at that member (e.g., a char array) that could make this assignment unsafe or mask a subsequent string operation. It also helps verify there are no side-effecting accessors that perform string operations.\n\n5) process_short_param (declaration + implementation)\n   - One of the callers. To ensure the pointers passed into process_param__timeout (param_name, param_tail, next_param) are valid and bounded, you must inspect the caller(s) to see how those pointers are derived (slicing into a larger buffer, temporary buffers, or heap memory). The caller may perform modifications (insert NULs, compute tails) that affect whether subsequent string operations can overrun.\n\n6) process_long_param (declaration + implementation)\n   - The other direct caller. Same rationale as for process_short_param: you need to know how parameters are prepared and what the valid extents/lifetimes of the char* pointers are before they reach process_param__timeout/get_param_value.\n\n7) process_short_params_str and process_params (declaration + implementation)\n   - These are the callers of process_short_param and process_long_param respectively (per the call graph). Inspecting them helps trace the origin of the input string buffers (e.g., a command-line buffer, a read buffer) and any tokenization logic that determines pointer bounds and null-termination. That origin information is crucial to determine whether any string.h usage in downstream functions might access beyond the intended object bounds.\n\nSummary: get_param_value and mhd_tool_str_to_uint are the primary implementation sites that may use string.h functions \u2014 include them first. The enum and tool_params definitions are needed to validate control flow and data types. The caller chain (process_short_param, process_long_param, and their callers) is required to establish the provenance, extents, and lifetime of the char* inputs so you can determine if any string operation can access beyond object bounds."
