  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment only declares the function and its const char * parameters and contains no calls to any <string.h> functions. A concrete violation scenario (hypothetical) would be if the function or a called helper did something like memcpy(dest, param_tail, strlen(param_tail)+1) where dest is smaller than the number of bytes copied or if param_tail is not NUL-terminated so strlen reads past its bounds; such usage would violate Rule 21.17."
