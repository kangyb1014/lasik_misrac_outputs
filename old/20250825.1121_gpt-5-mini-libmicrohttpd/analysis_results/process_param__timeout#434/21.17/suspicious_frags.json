    "value_res = get_param_value (param_name, param_tail, next_param,\n                               &param_value);",

  "explanation": "The only potential string-bound issues arise from passing the const char * pointers (param_name, param_tail, next_param) to another function that may use <string.h> routines; therefore the call to get_param_value and the function signature (which introduces those pointer parameters) should be reviewed. Other code in this function performs an enum comparison, an assignment to tool_params.timeout, and returns a value \u2014 none of these invoke or imply use of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
