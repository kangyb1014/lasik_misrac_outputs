The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN char *\nMHD_basic_auth_get_username_password (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                                      char **password)\n{\n  struct MHD_BasicAuthInfo *info;\n\n  info = MHD_basic_auth_get_username_password3 (connection);\n  if (NULL == info)\n    return NULL;\n\n  /* For backward compatibility this function must return NULL if\n   * no password is provided */\n  if (NULL != info->password)\n  {\n    char *username;\n\n    username = malloc (info->username_len + 1);\n    if (NULL != username)\n    {\n      memcpy (username, info->username, info->username_len + 1);\n      mhd_assert (0 == username[info->username_len]);\n      if (NULL != password)\n      {\n        *password = malloc (info->password_len + 1);\n        if (NULL != *password)\n        {\n          memcpy (*password, info->password, info->password_len + 1);\n          mhd_assert (0 == (*password)[info->password_len]);\n\n          free (info);\n          return username;
