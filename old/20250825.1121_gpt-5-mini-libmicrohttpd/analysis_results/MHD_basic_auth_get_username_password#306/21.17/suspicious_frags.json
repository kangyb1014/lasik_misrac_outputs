  "explanation": "Only the two memcpy calls use functions from <string.h> and therefore are the only places that can directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17; they must be investigated to ensure the source objects have at least the copied number of bytes. Other code fragments do not invoke any <string.h> functions and so are not relevant to Rule 21.17: malloc/free calls, NULL checks, the mhd_assert calls, logging (MHD_DLOG), and the return paths do not perform string-library copying and therefore do not risk accesses beyond an object via a string.h function. The array indexing (username[info->username_len], (*password)[info->password_len]) and the allocations are not string.h calls \u2014 they should be checked for general correctness but are not direct violations of Rule 21.17."
