  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not invoke or directly use the standard string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, nor do they perform pointer arithmetic or buffer accesses that could trigger out-of-bounds accesses related to those APIs. The allocation and subsequent NULL check for bauth ensure there is a valid buffer before it is initialized (the allocation size matches the size used in memset). The logging calls use string literals only. Simple assignments, state checks, and boolean flags do not involve string.h operations and therefore do not need investigation for this rule."
