  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided function. Specifically, the code does not contain any of the following known compiler-specific extensions that would need investigation: __attribute__ or other __... identifiers (e.g. __asm__, __builtin_*, __typeof__), statement-expressions ({ ... }) as an expression, nested functions, labels-as-values, inline assembly, nonstandard keyword extensions, or other vendor-specific pragmas. The use of true/false appears to be boolean literals (standard when stdbool.h is used) rather than a compiler extension; the backslash/newline string continuation and adjacent string literal concatenation are standard C; casts, sizeof, memset and conditional-compilation macros (HAVE_MESSAGES) are standard C features or macro use. The only macros/functions referenced (mhd_assert, MHD_connection_alloc_memory_, MHD_DLOG, _) are not defined in the fragment; their implementations might use extensions, but that is outside this function and cannot be determined from the provided code. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that explicitly use documented compiler language extensions and thus nothing to report for investigation under Rule 1.2."
