  "explanation": "I examined every controlling expression in the function. None are invariant at compile time or constant across executions, so no fragments need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3:\n\n- mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED <= connection->state): this is an assertion macro, not a loop/selection intended to be a controlling expression for program flow; even if it expands to a conditional it compares a constant macro to a runtime field (connection->state). Not an invariant controlling expression that affects normal control flow.\n- if (connection->rq.bauth_tried) return connection->rq.bauth;: this depends on the mutable field connection->rq.bauth_tried and thus is not invariant.\n- if (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED > connection->state) return NULL;: although MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED is a constant macro, the comparison involves connection->state (runtime value), so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- if (! find_auth_rq_header_ (connection, MHD_AUTHTYPE_BASIC, &h_auth_value)) { ... }: the condition depends on the return value of a function call and is therefore not invariant.\n- if (NULL == bauth) { ... }: this checks the result of a runtime allocation call; it is not invariant.\n- if (parse_bauth_params (h_auth_value.str, h_auth_value.len, bauth)) connection->rq.bauth = bauth; else { ... }: the condition depends on a parsing function result and runtime data, so it is not invariant.\n\nThere are no loop constructs (for/while/do-while) with constant controlling expressions; there are no characterized infinite loops created via invariant controlling expressions. Therefore, no code fragments in this function violate Rule 14.3 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation."
