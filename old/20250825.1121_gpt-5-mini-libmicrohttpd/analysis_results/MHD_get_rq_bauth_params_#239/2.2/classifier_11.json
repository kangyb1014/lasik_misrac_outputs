Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_rq_bauth_params_:\n```c\nconst struct MHD_RqBAuth *\nMHD_get_rq_bauth_params_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  struct _MHD_str_w_len h_auth_value;\n  struct MHD_RqBAuth *bauth;\n\n  mhd_assert (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED <= connection->state);\n\n  if (connection->rq.bauth_tried)\n    return connection->rq.bauth;\n\n  if (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED > connection->state)\n    return NULL;\n\n  if (! find_auth_rq_header_ (connection, MHD_AUTHTYPE_BASIC, &h_auth_value))\n  {\n    connection->rq.bauth_tried = true;\n    connection->rq.bauth = NULL;\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  bauth =\n    (struct MHD_RqBAuth *)\n    MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (connection, sizeof (struct MHD_RqBAuth));\n\n  if (NULL == bauth)\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Not enough memory in the connection's pool to allocate \" \\\n                 \"for Basic Authorization header parsing.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  memset (bauth, 0, sizeof(struct MHD_RqBAuth));\n  if (parse_bauth_params (h_auth_value.str, h_auth_value.len, bauth))\n    connection->rq.bauth = bauth;\n  else\n  {\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"The Basic Authorization client's header has \"\n                 \"incorrect format.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n    connection->rq.bauth = NULL;\n    /* Memory in the pool remains allocated until next request */\n  }\n  connection->rq.bauth_tried = true;\n  return connection->rq.bauth;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_rq_bauth_params_:\nstruct MHD_Connection\n{\n\n#ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextE;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the EDLL listing connections that are epoll-ready.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevE;\n#endif\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *next;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the DLL describing our IO state.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prev;\n\n  /**\n   * Next pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   * This DLL can be either the\n   * 'manual_timeout_head/manual_timeout_tail' or the\n   * 'normal_timeout_head/normal_timeout_tail', depending on whether a\n   * custom timeout is set for the connection.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *nextX;\n\n  /**\n   * Previous pointer for the XDLL organizing connections by timeout.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Connection *prevX;\n\n  /**\n   * Reference to the MHD_Daemon struct.\n   */\n  struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;\n\n  /**\n   * Request-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Request rq;\n\n  /**\n   * Reply-specific data\n   */\n  struct MHD_Reply rp;\n\n  /**\n   * The memory pool is created whenever we first read from the TCP\n   * stream and destroyed at the end of each request (and re-created\n   * for the next request).
