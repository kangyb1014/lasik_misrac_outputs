  "explanation": "No controlling expression in the provided function is manifestly invariant. The selection statements present are: 1) if (sizeof (struct sockaddr_in) <= (size_t) addrlen) \u2014 sizeof(...) is a compile-time constant but the condition depends on the runtime parameter addrlen, so it is not invariant. 2) if (AF_INET == addr->ss_family) \u2014 depends on the runtime value addr->ss_family. 3) #ifdef HAVE_INET6 is a preprocessor conditional (evaluated at translation time), not a C controlling expression governed by MISRA Rule 14.3. 4) if (sizeof (struct sockaddr_in6) <= (size_t) addrlen) and if (AF_INET6 == addr->ss_family) \u2014 analogous to the IPv4 checks and depend on runtime values. The memcpy/memset/return statements are not controlling expressions. The only compile-time constants (sizeof(...) and the AF_* macros) are used in comparisons with runtime values or in sizeof operands; thus none of the selection/iteration controlling expressions are invariant and require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Therefore there are no suspicious code fragments to report."
