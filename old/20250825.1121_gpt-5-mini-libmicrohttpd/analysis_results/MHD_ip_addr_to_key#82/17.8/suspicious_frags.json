  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The code performs only reads of addr and addrlen and modifies the object pointed to by key via memset and memcpy. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the parameter variable itself (e.g. assignments like addr = ..., key = ..., addrlen = ... or increments/decrements). There are no such assignments or pointer reassignments here. Casting addr to other pointer types or using a NULL-cast expression to compute a sizeof operand does not modify the parameter. Therefore no fragments require investigation under Rule 17.8."
