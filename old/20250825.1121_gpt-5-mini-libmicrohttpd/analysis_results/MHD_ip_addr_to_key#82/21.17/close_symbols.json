  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is needed for verifying memcpy/memset bounds:\n\n- struct MHD_IPCount\n  - The function writes into key (memset and memcpy into key->addr.ipv4/ipv6 and assigns key->family). You must know the exact layout and sizes of MHD_IPCount (the size of *key, the types and sizes of addr.ipv4 and addr.ipv6, and offset/placement of family) to ensure the memset size and the memcpy destination buffers are not overrun.\n\n- struct sockaddr_storage\n  - The function reads addr->ss_family and uses addrlen together with sizeof(sockaddr_in/6). Knowing the layout and position of ss_family in sockaddr_storage is necessary to confirm reading ss_family is within the provided addrlen and that casting addr to sockaddr_in/6 is safe relative to the provided buffer size.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in\n  - The code checks sizeof(struct sockaddr_in) <= addrlen and then copies sizeof(((struct sockaddr_in *) NULL)->sin_addr) bytes from ((struct sockaddr_in *) addr)->sin_addr. You need the full definition to determine sizeof(struct sockaddr_in) and the size and offset of sin_addr to validate the addrlen check actually guarantees the sin_addr read is in-bounds.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6\n  - Analogous to sockaddr_in for the IPv6 branch: sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6) is compared with addrlen and sin6_addr is copied. The definition is required to verify those checks and the memcpy size are consistent and safe.\n\n- struct in_addr\n  - sin_addr is typically of type struct in_addr; its size (and any padding) determines the memcpy length and must be compared against the destination field key->addr.ipv4 size.\n\n- struct in6_addr\n  - sin6_addr is typically of type struct in6_addr; its size determines the memcpy length and must be compared against key->addr.ipv6 size.\n\n- AF_INET\n  - The code compares addr->ss_family with AF_INET. While its numeric value does not affect bounds directly, you need to know the intended family values to reason about whether the branch selection and preceding size checks correspond to the right sockaddr layout.\n\n- AF_INET6\n  - Same rationale as AF_INET for the IPv6 branch.\n\n- HAVE_INET6\n  - The IPv6 branch is guarded by this macro. You must know whether HAVE_INET6 is defined in the build under analysis to know if the IPv6 code (and its memcpy) is present and therefore needs checking.\n\n- socklen_t\n  - The type and range of addrlen (socklen_t) matter for interpreting the sizeof(...) <= (size_t) addrlen comparisons. Knowing its definition ensures the cast to size_t and the comparison behavior are understood (e.g., signed/unsigned issues, truncation) when determining that the memcpy reads are protected by the addrlen checks.\n\n(Other symbols such as MHD_Result, MHD_YES/MHD_NO, or the memcpy/memset prototypes themselves are not needed to check for out\u2011of\u2011bounds access here \u2014 the critical items are the concrete struct layouts, sizes, the family constants, and whether the IPv6 code is compiled in.)"
