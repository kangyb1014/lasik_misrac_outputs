  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect every externally defined symbol, macro and type it relies on and their definitions/implementations. Specifically:\n\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: the return type and the constants used in returns could be macros or defined using nonstandard compiler extensions; you must see their actual definitions.\n\n- struct MHD_IPCount and its members (family, addr, and addr.ipv4/addr.ipv6): the code writes into these members and takes their sizes/addresses. Their declarations may use bitfields, flexible array members, anonymous unions/structs, or other extension constructs (e.g. GCC anonymous structs/unions) which would be relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\n- memset and memcpy: these are used directly; in some environments they may be implemented or defined via macros or wrappers that use extensions (intrinsics, builtins). Check their declarations to ensure no extension usage.\n\n- struct sockaddr_storage, socklen_t, struct sockaddr_in, struct sockaddr_in6 and the member types sin_addr / sin6_addr: the function casts the generic storage to these types and uses sizeof on their members via a NULL-cast expression. The actual definitions of these socket types (and in_addr/in6_addr) could contain implementation-specific constructs (anonymous unions, reserved fields with leading underscores, compiler-specific attributes) that might be language extensions.\n\n- AF_INET, AF_INET6: these macros/constants identify address families and could be defined in a way that uses platform-specific macros or extensions; include them to be certain.\n\n- HAVE_INET6: the IPv6 section is conditional; whether this block is compiled depends on this macro. Its presence/definition method (e.g. passed as compiler -D or defined in a header) affects whether code with potential extensions is compiled.\n\nCollecting the exact definitions of these symbols allows an auditor to confirm that the target function itself does not rely on or expand to language extensions (for example anonymous struct/union members, compiler builtins, nonstandard attributes, or macros that expand to extension constructs)."
