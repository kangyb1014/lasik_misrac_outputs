  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The function and related definitions use only standard C and common POSIX types/macros: static functions, enums, structs/unions, casts, sizeof, memset/memcpy, and #ifdef conditional compilation. The casts from sockaddr_storage to sockaddr_in/sockaddr_in6 and the sizeof(((type *)NULL)->member) idiom are standard, well-defined in C (sizeof operand is not evaluated) and are not compiler extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, inline assembly, statement expressions, nested functions, zero-length arrays, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
