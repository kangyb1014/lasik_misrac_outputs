  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function only uses memset and memcpy to initialize and copy binary address structures (struct MHD_IPCount, in_addr, in6_addr), not to compare null\u2011terminated strings. The memcpy calls copy fixed-size binary address fields (sizes obtained via sizeof on in_addr/in6_addr), and the memset zeroes a structure; neither is a string comparison. There are no other calls or operations in the snippet that attempt to compare null\u2011terminated strings with memcmp, so no fragments need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
