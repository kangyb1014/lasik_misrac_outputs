  "explanation": "mhd_assert \u2014 This macro/function is invoked in the target function; its definition or expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not call memcmp (or other routines that use memcmp) to compare null\u2011terminated strings in diagnostic/code paths. If mhd_assert expands to other logging/compare helpers, those must be checked too.\n\nmp_ptr_diff_ \u2014 This helper computes the offset of block relative to pool->memory. Inspect its implementation to verify it does not call memcmp on memory that could be a null\u2011terminated string (or perform string comparisons using memcmp).\n\nmp_ptr_le_ \u2014 This pointer comparison helper is used to check ordering of pointers; its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare pointer\u2011referenced data (which could inadvertently compare null\u2011terminated strings with memcmp).\n\nROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE \u2014 This macro/function is used in the return expression. Its definition must be examined to ensure it performs only arithmetic/bit operations and does not call memcmp on memory that could be null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nstruct MemoryPool \u2014 The MemoryPool definition (types of fields memory, pos, end, size) is required to determine whether pool->memory and block point to character buffers that might be treated as null\u2011terminated strings; this guides whether any called helper could be (mis)using memcmp on strings rather than raw memory.\n\nNote: The target function itself does not call memcmp, so the only way it could violate the MISRA rule is via any of the above symbols (macros/helpers) using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. The listed symbols are the ones that must be inspected to make that determination."
