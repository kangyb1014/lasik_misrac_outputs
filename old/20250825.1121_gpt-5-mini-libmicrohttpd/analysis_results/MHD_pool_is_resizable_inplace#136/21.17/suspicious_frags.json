  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function, therefore there are no direct uses of the standard string-handling APIs that could cause out-of-bounds accesses and need to be investigated under Rule 21.17. The function only performs pointer/size checks and arithmetic: it asserts block validity (block != NULL || block_size == 0), enforces pool->size >= block_size, computes a block_offset, and checks pool->size >= block_offset + block_size before returning a comparison involving ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE. These checks guard against straightforward out-of-bounds uses of the memory region by string functions. Note: any macros or helper functions referenced here (mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE) are not expanded in the provided code; they would only need investigation for Rule 21.17 if their implementations call any of the <string.h> functions. Since no such calls are present in the shown code, there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 21.17."
