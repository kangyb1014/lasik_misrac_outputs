  "explanation": "For a sound MISRA <string.h> out\u2011of\u2011bounds analysis you must know exactly how offsets and bounds inside the pool are computed and what guarantees the assertions provide. Specifically:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: You must know the meaning and units of memory, pos, end and size and their types (signed/unsigned integer widths). These fields define the buffer bounds that any string.h call could touch; without the struct you cannot decide whether an index or pointer is in\u2011bounds.\n\n- mp_ptr_diff_: This computes block_offset from block and pool->memory. Its exact definition (pointer subtraction, cast to size_t, undefined\u2011behaviour handling) determines whether block_offset is correct and whether arithmetic can overflow or produce an out\u2011of\u2011range value used later in comparisons.\n\n- mp_ptr_le_: The pointer comparison implementation/semantics are needed to know whether the code actually guarantees block >= pool->memory and thus that block_offset is non\u2011negative and meaningful.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: The return expression uses this macro/function to compute a rounded offset; you must know how rounding and red\u2011zone are applied (whether it can increase the offset beyond pool->size, whether it can overflow size_t) to decide if subsequent use (or callers relying on this test) could lead to buffer overrun when string functions are called.\n\n- alignment and red\u2011zone constants/macros used by ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: These constants determine how much extra space is required and therefore whether the rounded value can exceed the buffer bounds.\n\n- mhd_assert: Know whether assertions are active or compiled out. If assertions are compiled out, the function cannot rely on them to prevent out\u2011of\u2011bounds use; if active they may abort but do not necessarily prevent misuse by callers. MISRA analysis must consider whether the checks are guaranteed at runtime.\n\n- type of pool->memory: The pointer type (char*/unsigned char*/void*) affects pointer arithmetic and byte\u2011wise offset semantics used by mp_ptr_diff_ and by any subsequent byte copying (memcpy/memmove).\n\n(Additionally, if you want to determine real violations in the program rather than just in this function, you must inspect callers that perform memcpy/memmove/other string.h operations on the block or pool memory; their symbols/implementations would be required as well.)"
