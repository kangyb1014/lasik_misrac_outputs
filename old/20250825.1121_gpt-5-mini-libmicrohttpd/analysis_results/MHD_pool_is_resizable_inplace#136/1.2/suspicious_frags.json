  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, asm statements, statement-expressions ({ ... }), or inline assembler.\n- The macros (mhd_assert, mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE) use only standard preprocessor/token substitution, casts and pointer arithmetic, which are standard C constructs, not compiler extensions.\n- Pointer arithmetic and casts between pointer types and integer types are standard C (subject to portability/undefined-behavior checks, but not extensions covered by Rule 1.2).\n- The use of bool is standard in C99 via stdbool.h (or via a project typedef); its appearance here is not inherently a compiler extension.\n\nNotes about suspicious-looking tokens: the macro definitions show \"constuint8_t\" without a space (e.g. ((constuint8_t*)(p1))). That appears to be a token/typo in the snippet rather than a compiler extension; it would either be a user-defined typedef name (constuint8_t) or a source error (missing space making \"const uint8_t\"). In either case this is not evidence of a compiler language extension as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. If your intent is to check for typographical errors or missing headers/typedefs, that should be investigated under other MISRA rules, but it is not a Rule 1.2 language-extension violation."
