  "explanation": "For MISRA rule checking of language extensions we must inspect any externally-defined macros, inline helpers and types used by the function because those definitions may themselves employ compiler-specific extensions (GNU statement-expressions, __typeof__, __attribute__, __builtin_* functions, non\u2011standard keywords, etc.).\n\n- mhd_assert: typically a macro; its definition may use compiler extensions (statement-expressions, attributes, builtins) or non\u2011standard keywords. Need the exact macro/function body to decide. \n- mp_ptr_diff_: appears to be a helper (macro or inline); its implementation could use __typeof__/pointer magic or statement-expressions \u2014 potentially a language extension. \n- mp_ptr_le_: likely a macro or inline predicate; its definition could rely on typeof or other extensions to perform safe pointer comparisons. \n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: a macro/utility that often uses bit-twiddling macros or GCC extensions (e.g. __builtin_constant_p, statement-expr) \u2014 must inspect definition. \n- struct MemoryPool: the struct declaration is needed to see member types and any attributes on the struct or members (e.g. __attribute__((packed, aligned, visibility)) or non\u2011standard bitfields) which are language extensions. \n- MemoryPool.memory / MemoryPool.pos / MemoryPool.end / MemoryPool.size: explicitly list the members used so the analyzer can verify their types (pointer vs integer) and any per-member extensions/attributes that affect the operations in the function. \n- NULL: the macro definition (0 vs ((void*)0) vs compiler-specific) can be non\u2011standard in some environments \u2014 include to verify no extension is used. \n- bool: the boolean type may be a typedef or macro in the codebase; check whether it maps to standard _Bool or to a compiler-specific extension/keyword. \n- size_t: verify the typedef/source header to ensure it is the standard size_t and not an extension or unusual typedef.\n\nProviding these symbols (and their definitions) lets the next agent detect any use of compiler-specific language extensions in the code paths exercised by MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace."
