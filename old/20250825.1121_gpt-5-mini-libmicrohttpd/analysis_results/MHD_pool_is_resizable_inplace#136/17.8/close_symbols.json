  "explanation": "Provide the full definitions (macro expansions or function bodies/prototypes) for each listed symbol so the next agent can determine whether any of them modify the formal parameters (pool, block, block_size) or have side effects that would amount to modifying those parameters.\n\nReasons:\n- mhd_assert: This is a macro/function used repeatedly on expressions containing the parameters. As a macro it may evaluate its argument in a way that performs assignments or other side effects. The exact expansion is required to prove it does not assign to pool, block or block_size.\n\n- mp_ptr_diff_: This is used to compute block_offset from block and pool->memory. If implemented as a macro it might modify its pointer arguments (e.g. by assignment or by invoking helper expressions with side effects). The full implementation/prototype is required to verify it does not change the pointer parameter 'block' or any of the other parameters.\n\n- mp_ptr_le_: This comparison helper is passed pool->memory and block. If it is a macro it could contain side effects (assignments, increments) that modify 'block' or other parameters. Provide its definition to ensure it doesn't modify the pointer parameter.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: This macro/function is applied to the expression (block_offset + block_size). If it is a macro it could expand into code that modifies its argument or uses compound assignments with side effects affecting block_size or other variables. The exact definition is needed to confirm absence of modifications to the formal parameters.\n\n- struct MemoryPool (full definition): The function accesses members (memory, pos, end, size). The layout and types of these members may affect how macros/functions above operate (for example if pool->memory is itself a macro or accessor). The full struct and any accessor macros are needed so that any code interacting with pool or pool->memory can be inspected for assignments to the parameter 'pool' itself (or to detect hidden macros that rebind or write into 'pool').\n\nTogether, these symbols cover all places in the function where side effects could be hidden. With their definitions the analyzer can determine whether the pointer parameter variables (pool, block) or the scalar parameter (block_size) are ever written to (i.e., whether the function or any invoked macro/function modifies the parameter objects themselves)."
