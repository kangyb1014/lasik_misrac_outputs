  "explanation": "- struct MemoryPool (definition, including members memory, pos, end, size): The controlling expressions in this function refer directly to pool->pos, pool->end, pool->size and pool->memory. To decide if those expressions can be invariant (constant) you must know the types and semantics of these members and whether they can change at runtime.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function definition): The code contains several mhd_assert(...) calls. Depending on how mhd_assert is defined (expands to a runtime check with an if, to a no-op in release, or to something else) those assertions may introduce controlling expressions or be elided. Knowing its definition is required to determine whether any controlling expression in the source is actually present and whether it can be invariant.\n\n- mp_ptr_diff_ (macro/function definition): block_offset is computed with mp_ptr_diff_(block, pool->memory). To establish whether the expression using block_offset is invariant you must know how mp_ptr_diff_ computes its result (pointer arithmetic, casts, truncation, etc.).\n\n- mp_ptr_le_ (macro/function definition): mp_ptr_le_ appears in an assertion that constrains block relative to pool->memory; its definition is needed to understand whether that constraint is a compile-time constant or a runtime check and therefore whether it contributes an invariant controlling expression.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (macro/function definition): The return statement compares pool->pos to ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(block_offset + block_size). If that macro/function is purely a compile\u2011time constant expression (or reduces to one for given inputs) it could make the controlling expression invariant. Its definition (and whether it depends on runtime inputs) is required.\n\n- Macros/constants used by ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (alignment/rounding and red\u2011zone size): ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE often expands to other macros/constants (alignment, rounding helpers, red\u2011zone size). Those underlying constants determine whether the rounding expression is compile\u2011time invariant or depends on runtime values (block_offset, block_size), so they must be known to assess invariance."
