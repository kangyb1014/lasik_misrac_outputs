  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant in the provided function. The only explicit controlling construct is the if (NULL != block) test, which depends on the runtime parameter block and therefore is not an invariant. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements whose controlling expressions are constant. The return expression returns the result of a runtime equality test and is not a controlling construct. The mhd_assert(...) invocations are macro calls in the source shown (not explicit control statements here); as written they are not syntactic controlling constructs in this function. Without macro expansions there is no evidence of an invariant controlling expression to investigate, so no fragments are flagged."
