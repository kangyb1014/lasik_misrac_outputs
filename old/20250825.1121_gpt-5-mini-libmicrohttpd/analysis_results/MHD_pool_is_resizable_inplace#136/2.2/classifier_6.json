The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                               void *block,\n                               size_t block_size)\n{\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (block != NULL || block_size == 0);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_size);\n  if (NULL != block)\n  {\n    const size_t block_offset = mp_ptr_diff_ (block, pool->memory);\n    mhd_assert (mp_ptr_le_ (pool->memory, block));\n    mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset);\n    mhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset + block_size);\n    return (pool->pos ==\n            ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (block_offset + block_size));\n  }\n  return false; /* Unallocated blocks cannot be resized in-place */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace:\n#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)\n...\n#define mp_ptr_diff_(p1, p2) ((size_t)(((constuint8_t*)(p1))-((constuint8_t*)(p2))))\n...\n#define mp_ptr_le_(p1, p2) (((constuint8_t*)(p1))<=((constuint8_t*)(p2)))\n...\n#define ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(n) ROUND_TO_ALIGN(n)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (pool->size >= block_offset + block_size);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The mhd_assert macro is defined as ((void)0), so the statement reduces to a compile-time no-op (it does not generate an executed operation). MISRA 2.2 forbids dead code (code that is executed but whose removal would not affect behaviour); since this assertion is not executed (it is removed by the macro), it is not dead code in the sense of the rule."
