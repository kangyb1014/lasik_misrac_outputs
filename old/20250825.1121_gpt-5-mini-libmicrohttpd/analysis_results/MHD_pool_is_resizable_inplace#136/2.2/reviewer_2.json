  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Given the provided macro definition (#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)), each mhd_assert(...) call in MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace expands to a no-op expression statement ((void)0);. Such statements are executed but have no effect; removing them would not change the program behaviour. That matches the MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 definition of dead code (an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect behaviour). Therefore, under the supplied macro definition the assertion statement (and the other mhd_assert calls that expand to the same no-op) constitute dead code and violate Rule 2.2. Note: if the macro is defined differently in some build configurations (so that the assertion actually evaluates its argument or performs checks), then in those builds the calls would not be dead; the correctness of the report depends on the actual macro definition used in the project build. In the scenario as given, the report is correct."
