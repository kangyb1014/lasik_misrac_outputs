  "explanation": "All other expressions in MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace either use macros provided here that expand to plain expressions or constants (mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_, mhd_assert expands to ((void)0)) or perform simple member/pointer arithmetic. None of those introduce function calls that could create direct or indirect recursion. The only element whose definition is not shown here is ROUND_TO_ALIGN (used via ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE). If ROUND_TO_ALIGN is (or expands to) a function call, or calls other functions that could (directly or indirectly) call MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace, that would need investigation for Rule 17.2. Therefore only the use/definition of ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE / ROUND_TO_ALIGN needs further review; all other fragments need not be investigated for recursive calls."
