  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace violates the MISRA recursion rule you must inspect every symbol it invokes (and the transitive calls those symbols make).\n\n- mhd_assert: Often a macro that expands to an assertion handler or calls a runtime function (e.g. __assert_fail, abort, or a project-specific handler). You must see its definition/expansion and callees to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace.\n\n- mp_ptr_diff_: Presently invoked as a function (or inline helper). Its body must be inspected to check if it calls back to MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (indirect recursion) or calls other functions that could.\n\n- mp_ptr_le_: Same rationale as mp_ptr_diff_: it may be an inline/function-like helper; inspect its implementation and its callees for any path back to MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE: This is used as an expression but may be a macro or function-like helper. You need its expansion/definition to determine whether it introduces any function calls that could lead (directly or indirectly) to MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace.\n\nInspecting these symbols (and then recursively any functions they call) is sufficient to determine whether the target function makes a direct or indirect call to itself."
