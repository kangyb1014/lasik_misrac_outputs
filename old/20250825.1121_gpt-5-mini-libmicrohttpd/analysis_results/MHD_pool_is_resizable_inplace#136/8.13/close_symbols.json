  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is needed to decide whether pointers in MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace can/should be const-qualified under MISRA:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: The struct definition (fields and their types) is required because the function accesses pool->memory, pool->pos, pool->end and pool->size. In particular, the exact declared type of pool->memory (see next item) determines whether it can/should be const.\n\n- MemoryPool.memory (type of the memory member): Knowing whether pool->memory is declared as void *, char *, const void *, etc. is essential: the function passes pool->memory to mp_ptr_diff_ and mp_ptr_le_. If memory is non-const, that may force pool (or its memory member) to remain non-const; if it is const, that supports making block or pool pointer const.\n\n- mp_ptr_diff_(...) (prototype/signature): The parameter types (e.g. void * vs const void *) determine whether passing a const-qualified pointer (for block or pool->memory) would be type-correct. If mp_ptr_diff_ expects non-const pointers, making block/ memory const would produce an incompatible call (unless casts are used), which bears on whether const-qualification is \"possible\" per MISRA.\n\n- mp_ptr_le_(...) (prototype/signature): Same reason as mp_ptr_diff_: this function is called with pool->memory and block; its parameter constness determines whether block/pool->memory can be const-qualified without causing prototype mismatch or required casts.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(...) (macro or function signature): Although this operates on sizes and not pointers, its signature matters only to ensure no pointer is passed through it; including it confirms there are no hidden pointer parameters or side effects that would require non-const access to block/pool. It also lets an analyzer confirm the only pointer usage is read-only address arithmetic.\n\n- mhd_assert(...) (macro/function signature): The assert macro/function is used with pointer expressions; its definition may take arguments in a way that affects constness analysis (for example, if it were implemented as a function taking pointer arguments). Confirming it is a macro taking an expression (or accepts const) ensures the pointer arguments are not being implicitly converted or modified, supporting a const qualification.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether the function only reads pointer values (so parameters/fields could be const) and whether downstream calls accept const-qualified pointers without incompatible conversions, which is necessary to judge compliance with MISRA's \"pointer should point to const whenever possible\" rule."
