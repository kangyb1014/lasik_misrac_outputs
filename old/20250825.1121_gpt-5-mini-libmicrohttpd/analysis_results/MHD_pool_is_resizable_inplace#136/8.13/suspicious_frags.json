  "explanation": "I only flagged fragments that declare or use pointer types where a const qualification might be applicable and therefore need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Other lines in the function are checks, arithmetic on offsets (size_t), macro invocations, assertions, or return logic that do not introduce pointer declarations or pointer-typed parameters that could be const-qualified; hence they do not need investigation for this rule. Fields such as pool->size, pool->pos, and pool->end are size_t and not pointer types. The remaining uses of those fields and the ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE expression operate on integer offsets, not on pointer type qualifiers, so they are outside the scope of Rule 8.13 in this function."
