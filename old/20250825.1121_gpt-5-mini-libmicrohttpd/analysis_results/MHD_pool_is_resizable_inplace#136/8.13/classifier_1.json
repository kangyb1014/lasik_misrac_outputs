  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The expression passes pool->memory (declared as uint8_t *) and block (declared as void *) to a comparison function but neither pointer is modified \u2014 they are used only for read-only operations. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, such pointers should be const-qualified when possible (e.g. const uint8_t *memory in the struct and const void *block in the function). Because these pointers are not const-qualified despite being usable as read-only, this is a violation of Rule 8.13. (If, however, pool->memory must be writable elsewhere, memory may legitimately be non-const; in that case only block should be changed to const and the violation would be limited to block.)"
