  "explanation": "Investigate the listed fragments because they are the only places where control flow can make code reachable or unreachable in this function: the explicit if/else (block != NULL) branch containing an early return and the final return false. Possible issues to check: whether the API or surrounding invariants make one branch impossible (e.g. block never NULL in all call sites, or asserts implying the else branch cannot occur), and whether the two size-related assertions are redundant such that one of them can never fail or ever be relevant (which could indicate unreachable assertion code). Other parts of the function do not present unreachable-code concerns: the initial mhd_assert invocations are simple precondition checks (may be compiled out in release, but they do not introduce unreachable statements), the calculation of block_offset is used only when block != NULL (inside the if) and thus is reachable under that condition, and the return expression inside the if is a valid reachable exit when block is non-NULL. No other statements in the function create control-flow that can never be executed, so they need not be investigated for MISRA Rule 2.1."
