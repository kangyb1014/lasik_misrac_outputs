  "explanation": "To decide whether any part of MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace is unreachable you must know the exact semantics (and build-time expansion) of every symbol that can change control flow or make conditions tautological: \n\n- struct MemoryPool (full definition): The function inspects pool->pos, pool->end, pool->size and pool->memory. Their types and any documented/implicit invariants determine whether the if (NULL != block) branch or the return expression can ever be reached or whether certain comparisons are always true/false.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function and build-time configuration): An assertion macro can be a no-op, or it can abort/longjmp/terminate on failure. If mhd_assert can alter control flow (abort/exit), statements after certain asserts may be effectively unreachable. Also the macro expansion may reference expressions with side effects.\n\n- mp_ptr_diff_ (definition/prototype and semantics/return type): block_offset is computed by this symbol. Its exact arithmetic (signed/unsigned, overflow behavior) and return type determine the possible values of block_offset used in the return expression; that affects whether the equality can hold or be impossible.\n\n- mp_ptr_le_ (definition/prototype and semantics): Used in an assert; if it has side effects or a nontrivial definition it may affect reachability or the truth of surrounding assumptions.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (macro/function and dependent constants): The return expression compares pool->pos to ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(block_offset + block_size). If this macro always yields a value equal/unequal to pool->pos for all valid inputs, the return in the if branch may be constant and other branches effectively unreachable. You must know how this macro computes alignment and adds the \"red zone.\" Also include any constants it uses (ALIGNMENT, RED_ZONE) if not encapsulated in the macro definition.\n\n- Type/definition of pool->memory (pointer type): mp_ptr_diff_ and pointer comparisons depend on the pointer representation and allowed pointer arithmetic. Knowing the exact type (char*, void*, unsigned char*, etc.) is necessary to reason about block_offset and comparisons.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions and relevant compile-time configuration) lets the next analyzer determine whether any condition is always true/false or whether asserts can force non-return, and thus whether any statements in the function are unreachable."
