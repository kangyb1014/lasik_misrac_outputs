The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "The MISRA requirement about for-loops requires inspection not only of for statements textually present in this function but also of the behaviour of any functions or macros called from it (\"The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement\"). To decide whether the target function violates that rule you therefore must inspect the implementations/expansions of all called symbols and the data they operate on:\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function): Called multiple times. The assert macro may expand to code or call helper functions that could contain for-loops or other loop control constructs; those loops must be checked for MISRA well-formedness.\n\n- mhd_assert expansion targets (e.g. mhd_assert_failed or other helpers): If mhd_assert expands to or calls other functions, those functions are part of the function behaviour and must be inspected for for-loops and whether loop counters/objects are correctly used/modified.\n\n- mp_ptr_diff_ (function or macro): Called to compute block_offset. Its implementation may include loops (or use objects modified by loops) so it must be examined for any for statements and for compliance with the three-clause restrictions.\n\n- mp_ptr_le_ (function or macro): Called in assertions; its implementation may contain loops or side effects that affect loop-counter usage elsewhere; include it in the analysis.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE and its expansion (ROUND_TO_ALIGN, ALIGN, RED_ZONE constants, etc.): The macro/function used in the return expression could expand into code that includes loops or uses objects that loops modify. All macros/functions expanding from it must be checked.\n\n- struct MemoryPool (and its members memory, pos, end, size): The types and possible accessor semantics of these members are required to determine whether any called function or macro modifies them, and whether they could be used as loop counters or loop control flags in called code. If any of these members are actually macros or accessed via accessor functions, those accessors must be reviewed as well.\n\n- Any accessor macros/functions for pool members: If pool->pos, pool->end, pool->size or pool->memory are implemented via macros or accessor functions, those expansions may contain loops or side effects that affect MISRA analysis and must be inspected.\n\nIn short: to decide MISRA for-loop compliance you must examine every called function/macro (and the macros they expand to) and the definitions of the MemoryPool members they operate on, because any for-loop inside those implementations contributes to the effective behaviour of this function and must be verified against the rule."
