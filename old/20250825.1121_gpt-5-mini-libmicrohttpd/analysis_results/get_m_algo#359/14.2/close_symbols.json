The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to assess MISRA \"well\u2011formed for loop\" for get_m_algo:\n\n- force_md5\n  - Need the declaration/definition and type to confirm it is a plain boolean/integer object (or a simple macro) with no hidden side effects or embedded control flow (e.g. a macro that expands to code with loops). The MISRA check must ensure no loop behaviour can be introduced via these identifiers when evaluating the function body.\n\n- force_sha256\n  - Same reason as force_md5: verify it is a simple object or constant (not a macro/function that contains loops or modifies loop counters) and has no side effects that could affect loop well\u2011formedness elsewhere.\n\n- force_sha512_256\n  - Same as above for force flags: ensure it does not expand to or call code with loops or side effects.\n\n- enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3\n  - Need the enum definition to confirm the return type is a plain enumeration (no macros or inline functions hidden behind the name) and that returned constants are simple compile\u2011time values. This rules out any surprising behaviour embedded in the type or its accessors that could relate to loop semantics.\n\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_MD5\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA256\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA512_256\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_ANY_NON_SESSION\n  - For each returned symbol we need their definitions (enum constants or macros). Verify they are simple constant values (not function\u2011like macros or expressions that perform side effects or contain loops). This ensures the function body has no hidden loops or modifications that could affect MISRA analysis of for\u2011loops.\n\nNotes: get_m_algo itself contains no for loop. The only way it could violate the MISRA for\u2011loop rule is if any of the referenced symbols expand to or invoke code that contains for loops or modify loop counters/objects used by a for loop elsewhere (MISRA considers the behaviour of called code). Therefore the above symbols are exactly those that must be inspected to conclude there is no indirect for\u2011loop violation."
