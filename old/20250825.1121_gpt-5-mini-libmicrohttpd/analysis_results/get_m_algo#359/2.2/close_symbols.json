  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- force_md5\n  - get_m_algo's first branch depends on this global. To determine if that branch (and its return) is ever executed or removable as dead code we must see the variable's definition, initial value, and all write sites (places that set or clear it).\n\n- force_sha256\n  - Same as force_md5 for the SHA-256 branch: need its declaration/definition and all assignments to know whether that branch can be reached or is effectively dead.\n\n- force_sha512_256\n  - Same rationale for the SHA-512/256 branch: analyze definition and mutation sites to decide reachability and whether removing that branch affects program behavior.\n\n- reply_with_auth_required\n  - The only direct caller of get_m_algo per the call graph. To decide if get_m_algo is actually used at runtime (i.e., not dead), we must inspect this function to see how it uses the returned enum (whether it forwards it to APIs that change behavior) and whether reply_with_auth_required is reachable/executed.\n\n- handle_sec_areas_req\n  - Listed caller of reply_with_auth_required. To determine overall reachability of get_m_algo from program entry points, we need the caller chain; inspect this function and its invocation contexts to know if reply_with_auth_required (hence get_m_algo) can be invoked.\n\n- MHD_queue_auth_required_response3\n  - Likely receives the enum returned by get_m_algo in reply_with_auth_required. We must inspect its prototype/semantics to know whether the enum value affects observable program behavior (side effects, network responses, protocol behavior). If the returned value has no effect on behavior downstream, get_m_algo could be dead.\n\n- MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3 (enum type)\n  - The type definition clarifies the meaning of enum values and whether any value carries special semantics used elsewhere; helpful to determine if different returns are semantically significant and thus whether removing particular return paths would change behavior.\n\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_MD5\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA256\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_SHA512_256\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_MULT_ALGO3_ANY_NON_SESSION\n  - The specific enum constants returned by get_m_algo. Their semantic uses must be checked (where they are compared/used) to know if returning one versus another alters behavior. If all return values are treated identically by callers or downstream APIs, the function may be dead; otherwise it is not.\n\nNotes on scope for the next agent: for each symbol above supply the symbol declaration/definition, all write sites (for globals), the full body of caller functions, and the prototype/implementation (or documentation) of MHD_queue_auth_required_response3 so the agent can decide reachability and whether the return value affects observable behavior (timing, protocol responses, side effects)."
