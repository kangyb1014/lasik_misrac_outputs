  "explanation": "- reply_with_auth_required: Direct caller of get_m_algo (from the static call graph). Its body must be inspected to see whether it (directly or indirectly) calls get_m_algo again, or calls other functions that can lead back to get_m_algo, creating recursion.\n- handle_sec_areas_req: Caller of reply_with_auth_required (from the static call graph). Its implementation is required to determine whether there is a call path from handle_sec_areas_req back to get_m_algo (via reply_with_auth_required or other functions), producing indirect recursion.\n- MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static: A callee of reply_with_auth_required. Although likely a library function, its implementation or documentation must be checked to ensure it does not call user callbacks that could eventually invoke reply_with_auth_required/get_m_algo.\n- MHD_add_response_header: Same reason as above \u2014 a callee of reply_with_auth_required; confirm it cannot invoke application callbacks that form a call cycle.\n- MHD_queue_auth_required_response3: Direct callee of reply_with_auth_required and likely to interact with the library's event/callback mechanism. Its prototype/implementation must be inspected for callback parameters or synchronous calls into application code that could cause a path back to reply_with_auth_required/get_m_algo.\n- get_m_QOP: Another callee of reply_with_auth_required; its body must be checked for any calls that might reach back to reply_with_auth_required/get_m_algo.\n- MHD_destroy_response: Callee of reply_with_auth_required; verify it does not trigger user callbacks that could produce an indirect call cycle.\n- prototypes_of_MHD_queue_auth_required_response3_and_related_MHD_callbacks: Explicitly include the prototypes (and any callback type definitions) for MHD_queue_auth_required_response3 and other MHD functions used. Many library functions accept function-pointer callbacks or perform synchronous callbacks into application code; inspecting these prototypes is required to determine whether library calls can indirectly invoke application functions (such as handle_sec_areas_req or reply_with_auth_required) and thereby create indirect recursion.\n\nIn summary: to determine compliance with the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect self-calls, you must inspect the implementations of the caller chain (reply_with_auth_required and handle_sec_areas_req), each callee in that chain, and the MHD library function prototypes/implementations to rule out callbacks or other control-flow that could create a cycle back to get_m_algo."
