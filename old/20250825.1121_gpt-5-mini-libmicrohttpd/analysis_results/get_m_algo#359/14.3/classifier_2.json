  "scenario": "In the shown fragment the controlling expression is the non-const static variable force_md5. As presented (static int force_md5 = 0) the variable is not an integer constant expression and may be modified at runtime, so the controlling expression is not inherently invariant and Rule 14.3 is not violated. A violation scenario would occur if force_md5 were actually invariant (for example if it were a compile\u2011time constant, a const qualified object, or if static force_md5 is never modified anywhere so that its value is always 0/always non\u2011zero). In that case the condition would be invariant and would violate Rule 14.3."
