  "scenario": "No violation: in the fragment the controlling expression is the variable \"force_sha256\", which is declared as a non-const static int and therefore not necessarily invariant (it may be modified elsewhere). However, a violation would occur if that variable were in fact invariant \u2014 for example if it were a compile-time constant (e.g. a macro or a static const initialized to 0) or if it is never modified at run-time and always remains 0/false; in that case the controlling expression would be invariant and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
