  "explanation": "For MISRA rule analysis we must know whether each controlling expression in get_m_algo is potentially invariant (compile-time constant or never changes) or can vary at run time. For each listed symbol the next agent must provide: the symbol\u2019s declaration (type, storage class, const/volatile qualifiers, linkage), any preprocessor #define that aliases it, the defining/initialization site(s), all assignments or writes (including in other translation units), and any functions/interrupt handlers/threads that may modify it (setter functions).\n\nWhy each is required:\n- force_md5: This is the first controlling expression. To determine if the if (force_md5) test is invariant we need the declaration (is it a literal macro, const, or ordinary/volatile/global variable?), its initializer, and any code that can modify it at runtime. If it is a compile-time #define or const-initialized and never written, the controlling expression is invariant and could violate MISRA unless an exception applies.\n- force_sha256: Same reasoning as above for the second else-if branch; we must know whether this symbol can change at runtime or is effectively a constant.\n- force_sha512_256: Same reasoning as above for the third else-if branch.\n\n(Do not forget to include any macros or header definitions that expand to these names and any setter/initializer functions that affect them\u2014those are needed to establish mutability and thus whether the controlling expressions are invariant.)"
