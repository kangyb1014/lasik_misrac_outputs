  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses standard C features only: static storage class, an enum return type, if/else-if control flow, and return of enum constants. The additional static int flag variables are standard declarations. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm, typeof, __int128, long long if non-standard, GCC statement expressions, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific keywords) in the shown fragments, so nothing needs further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
