  "explanation": "Explain why each is needed:\n\n1) struct MHD_Response (definition)\n- To see the exact layout and types of fields assigned in the function (response->fd, response->is_pipe, response->crc_cls). In particular, confirm that response->fd is an ordinary modifiable field (not a const, bit-field with special semantics, or a union member that could alias the local parameter name). This rules out any subtle aliasing or qualification that might make the assignment effectively modify the parameter.\n\n2) MHD_create_response_from_callback (declaration/definition or macro expansion)\n- The call to this symbol returns the response object used later. If this symbol is actually a macro or an inlined function it could expand to code that references or assigns to the local identifier fd (or otherwise modifies the parameter variable). To prove the parameter fd is not modified inside the target function you must ensure that the callee/macro does not contain code that assigns to the caller's parameter variable.\n\n3) pipe_reader (definition)\n- It is passed as a callback pointer (address-of). If pipe_reader is a macro or inline function it could (in pathological code) expand into code that references the caller scope and the identifier fd. Confirming its definition excludes any hidden modification of fd via macro expansion or other preprocessor tricks.\n\n4) free_callback (definition)\n- Same rationale as for pipe_reader: if this is a macro or inline function rather than a plain function pointer, verify it does not expand to code that modifies the local parameter variable fd.\n\n5) MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN and MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE (macro definitions)\n- They are passed as arguments to the callee and might be macros that expand into expressions containing identifiers or code. Verify they do not expand into constructs that could reference/modify the local parameter identifier fd via preprocessor tricks.\n\n6) MHD_EXTERN (macro)\n- Confirms whether the function declaration/definition is modified by preprocessor tricks that could affect symbol resolution or expansion; in some codebases macros used in declarations are complex and could hide unusual expansions.\n\nNotes on necessity and scope:\n- In standard C, a callee cannot directly modify a caller's by-value parameter. The main concern for MISRA C (\"a function parameter shall not be modified\") is whether this function's own code (including any macros it expands) assigns to the parameter variable fd. The items above are those that could legally be expanded inline or as macros and thereby introduce such an assignment. The struct definition is needed to ensure that the assignment response->fd = fd is not, via aliasing/union/bit-field/qualifier, effectively modifying the parameter itself.\n\n- If you can confirm from the project sources that the listed symbols are ordinary (not macros that expand into code referencing caller identifiers) and that struct MHD_Response defines fd as a separate field, then the function does not modify its parameter fd and therefore does not violate the MISRA rule."
