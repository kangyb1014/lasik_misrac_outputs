  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function has a single parameter (int fd) which is never assigned to or modified inside the function \u2014 it is only used on the right-hand side of the assignment response->fd = fd. There are no pointer parameters in this function whose value (the pointer) could be modified; only the object pointed to by response (a local variable) has its members modified, which is allowed. Passing &pipe_reader and &free_callback to another function are address-of operations when calling a function, not modifications of this function's parameters. Therefore, no code in this function appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
