  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code for loop controlling expressions (for, while, do-while) that are invariant. No loop constructs appear in the supplied fragments: MHD_create_response_from_pipe, MHD_create_response_from_callback, pipe_reader, free_callback, and the macro definitions contain only if statements, returns and constant macro definitions. None of those are loop controlling expressions, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) is not applicable to any fragment shown. There are no do-while loops that would require checking the exception for an essentially Boolean constant, and no infinite-loop constructs are present. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for Rule 14.3 in the provided code."
