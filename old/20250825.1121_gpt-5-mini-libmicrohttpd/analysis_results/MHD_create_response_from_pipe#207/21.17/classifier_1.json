  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment '&free_callback' is taking the address of a callback (a function pointer) passed to MHD_create_response_from_callback; there is no use of any <string.h> function in the fragment or surrounding function, so Rule 21.17 (preventing out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses by string.h functions) is not implicated. A specific violation of Rule 21.17 would look like, for example, calling memcpy(dest, src, n) where n > sizeof(dest) (e.g. char dest[3]; char src[5] = \"abcd\"; memcpy(dest, src, 5);), which is not present here."
