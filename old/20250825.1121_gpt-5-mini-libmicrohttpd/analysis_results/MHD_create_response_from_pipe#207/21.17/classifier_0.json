MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses caused by string handling functions (e.g. memcpy, strcpy). A concrete violation would look like calling memcpy(dest, src, n) where n exceeds the size of dest (or similarly using strcpy/strcat with buffers too small), but that does not occur in the shown fragment."
