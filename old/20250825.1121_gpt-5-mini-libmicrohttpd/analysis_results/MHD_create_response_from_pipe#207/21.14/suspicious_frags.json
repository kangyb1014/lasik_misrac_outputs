  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I examined all provided code fragments (MHD_create_response_from_pipe, MHD_create_response_from_callback, pipe_reader, free_callback, and the MHD_Response struct). None of these fragments contains any use of the Standard Library function memcmp, nor do they perform any byte-wise comparisons of null-terminated strings that would suggest memcmp was used indirectly. The code performs I/O (read/close), allocation/initialization, and field assignments only; there are no string comparison operations present. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied snippets that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If memcmp usage exists elsewhere in the codebase, those locations would need to be provided for review."
