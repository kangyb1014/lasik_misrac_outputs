  "explanation": "- MHD_create_response_from_callback: This is the direct callee; its implementation must be inspected to see whether it (or functions it calls) calls memcmp to compare strings. If memcmp is used there on NUL-terminated strings, the MISRA violation would arise from this call chain.  \n- pipe_reader: The address of this callback is passed into MHD_create_response_from_callback; its body might itself call memcmp (or pass string pointers into callers that do). You must examine its implementation to determine if memcmp is being used to compare NUL-terminated strings.  \n- free_callback: Also passed as a callback; its implementation must be checked for memcmp usage or for passing string pointers into memcmp.  \n- struct MHD_Response: The type definition is needed to determine whether any fields (pointers stored or passed) are C-strings that could be compared with memcmp in the callee or callbacks (and to understand semantics of assignments such as crc_cls = response).  \n- memcmp: The standard-library function itself must be searched for in the bodies above (or their callees) to find actual uses and inspect the argument expressions and lengths to decide whether it is being (incorrectly) used to compare NUL-terminated strings."
