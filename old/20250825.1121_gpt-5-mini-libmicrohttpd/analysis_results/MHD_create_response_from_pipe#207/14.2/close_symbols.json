Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' analysis:\n\n- MHD_create_response_from_callback (function definition): The target function calls this function. Any for-loops contained in that function (or expressions used in its for-loop clauses) are part of the dynamic behaviour reachable from the target and must be inspected for MISRA compliance. The callee's source is the primary place to look for for-statements that could violate the rule.\n\n- pipe_reader (function definition / callback): This pointer is passed into MHD_create_response_from_callback and may be invoked inside that function (including from inside any for-loop bodies). The behaviour of functions called inside a for-loop body counts toward the loop's body; therefore the implementation of pipe_reader must be inspected to determine whether it introduces side effects or modifies objects used as loop counters.\n\n- free_callback (function definition / destructor callback): Similarly, the destructor/free callback is passed into the callee and could be called inside loops. Its implementation is required to determine whether it modifies objects used in loop clauses or introduces persistent side effects.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (type definition): The target function writes to response->fd, response->is_pipe and response->crc_cls. If any of these fields (or the structure layout/type) are referenced by for-loop clauses or modified by functions examined (e.g., used as loop counters or flags), their types and semantics must be known. Also needed to understand whether crc_cls = response creates aliases that could be modified in called functions and thus affect loop control.\n\n- callback typedefs used by MHD_create_response_from_callback (e.g. read/iterator/destructor typedefs): The exact prototype (argument types, constness, pointer-to-data) determines which objects callbacks may access or modify. Knowing these typedefs helps determine whether callbacks can legally modify loop counters or other objects used by for-loop clauses.\n\n- MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN (macro / constant): Passed to the callee and may influence control-flow inside it (for example used as a loop bound or sentinel). To determine whether any for-loop second/third clauses use objects modified in the loop body, you must know if this constant leads to loop conditions that rely on mutable objects.\n\n- MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE (macro / constant): Likewise, this block-size parameter could be used in loop initialization, condition or increment expressions inside the callee; its value/definition is needed to judge whether loops are well-formed and whether loop counters and increments conform to the MISRA constraints.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no for loops; the potential MISRA violation can only arise from for-loops in the called code or in callbacks passed to it. Therefore the close-symbol list focuses on the callee and any functions/definitions that the callee may invoke or rely upon."
