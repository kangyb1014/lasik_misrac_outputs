  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in MHD_create_response_from_pipe are unreachable you must know whether the call can ever return a non-NULL pointer and whether the subsequent assignments are valid. Each listed symbol is required for that determination:\n\n- MHD_create_response_from_callback (implementation / contract): You need the function body or its documented contract to know whether it can return NULL (making the after-check code unreachable) or whether it is guaranteed to return a valid response (which would render the NULL-check pointless). Also needed to detect any attributes (e.g. noreturn) or early exits that would make later lines unreachable.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (type/field definitions): The definition shows whether fields fd, is_pipe, and crc_cls exist and whether assigning to them is valid or has side effects. It also reveals any implementation-defined semantics (e.g. these fields being macros or mapped to functions) that could affect reachability.\n\n- pipe_reader (callback function definition): The callback passed influences whether MHD_create_response_from_callback can succeed (e.g. if the callback signature is invalid or the function requires a non-NULL/valid callback). Its presence/semantics may affect return behavior of the factory function.\n\n- free_callback (callback function definition): Similar to pipe_reader \u2014 the free callback supplied may be validated by MHD_create_response_from_callback and could cause it to fail; its type/definition is needed to assess that.\n\n- MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN (macro / constant): This argument value may be a sentinel that alters MHD_create_response_from_callback behavior (accept/reject, allocate/don't allocate). Its meaning is needed to reason about possible return values.\n\n- MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE (macro / constant): The block-size argument may affect allocation/validation inside MHD_create_response_from_callback and therefore whether the call can succeed or must fail.\n\n(Other compile-time symbols such as standard boolean definitions are encompassed by the struct and callback definitions and are not required separately for reachability analysis.)"
