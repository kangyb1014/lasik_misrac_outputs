  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because they do not present opportunities to qualify pointers as const without changing observable behaviour: - The 'buf' parameter of pipe_reader is written to (it is the read target), so it must be a non-const char*. - free_callback intentionally modifies the pointed MHD_Response (closes fd and sets response->fd = -1), so its cls parameter cannot be const-qualified. - response->data is assigned to an internal writable buffer ((void *)&response[1]) and is used as a writeable buffer, so it must remain non-const. - The assignments to response->fd and response->is_pipe explicitly modify the structure, so those pointers/fields are intentionally non-const. The listed fragments are the places where const might be applicable (or where the API's non-const void* usage should be reviewed): the crc_cls parameter and storage (response->crc_cls) and the cls parameter in pipe_reader (which, in this implementation, does not modify the pointed-to object). These should be investigated to determine whether they can be changed to point to const-qualified types or whether the API constraints (callbacks that sometimes must modify the object) prevent that."
