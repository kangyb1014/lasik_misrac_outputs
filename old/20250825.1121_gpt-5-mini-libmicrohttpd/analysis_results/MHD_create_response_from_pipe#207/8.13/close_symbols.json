  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Response (full definition): required to see the exact types (and any const-qualification) of members that are written here, notably crc_cls (its pointer type and whether it is const-qualified), fd and is_pipe. Assigning response to crc_cls or mutating response fields may prevent using const; the struct layout and member types are necessary to decide if pointers could/should be const.\n\n- prototype/declaration of MHD_create_response_from_callback: required to know the parameter types and return type it expects/produces (in particular the types of the callback parameters and whether it returns a pointer-to-const or pointer-to-non-const). The const-qualification in its signature affects whether passing &pipe_reader / &free_callback violates the \u2018\u2018pointer should point to const whenever possible\u2019\u2019 guidance.\n\n- declaration/prototype of pipe_reader: required to inspect the function pointer signature being passed (&pipe_reader). You must know the parameter and return types (and their const-qualification) to determine whether the function pointer type should point to const-qualified data and whether the call-site is compatible.\n\n- declaration/prototype of free_callback: required to inspect its parameter types (e.g. pointer-to-data to be freed) and whether those should be const-qualified; this affects whether passing &free_callback is consistent with the \u2018\u2018pointer to const whenever possible\u2019\u2019 rule.\n\n- typedef(s) for the callback types used by MHD_create_response_from_callback (reader-callback type and free-callback type): the exact typedef names and signatures (as used in the create_response_from_callback prototype) are needed to compare against the actual pipe_reader/free_callback declarations and to determine whether the typedefs themselves should use const-qualified pointer types.\n\n(Other macros/constants like MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN or MHD_FILE_READ_BLOCK_SIZE, or the boolean type for is_pipe, do not affect pointer const-qualification analysis and are not required.)"
