  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of parse_cookie_header:\n```c\nstatic enum _MHD_ParseCookie\nparse_cookie_header (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  const char *hdr;\n  size_t hdr_len;\n  char *cpy;\n  size_t i;\n  enum _MHD_ParseCookie parse_res;\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *const saved_tail =\n    connection->rq.headers_received_tail;\n  const bool allow_partially_correct_cookie =\n    (1 >= connection->daemon->client_discipline);\n\n  if (MHD_NO ==\n      MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                     MHD_HEADER_KIND,\n                                     MHD_HTTP_HEADER_COOKIE,\n                                     MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (\n                                       MHD_HTTP_HEADER_COOKIE),\n                                     &hdr,\n                                     &hdr_len))\n    return MHD_PARSE_COOKIE_OK;\n  if (0 == hdr_len)\n    return MHD_PARSE_COOKIE_OK;\n\n  cpy = MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (connection,\n                                      hdr_len + 1);\n  if (NULL == cpy)\n    parse_res = MHD_PARSE_COOKIE_NO_MEMORY;\n  else\n  {\n    memcpy (cpy,\n            hdr,\n            hdr_len);\n    cpy[hdr_len] = '\\0';\n\n    i = 0;\n    /* Skip all initial whitespaces */\n    while (i < hdr_len && (' ' == cpy[i] || '\\t' == cpy[i]))\n      i++;\n\n    parse_res = parse_cookies_string (cpy + i, hdr_len - i, connection);\n  }\n\n  switch (parse_res)\n  {\n  case MHD_PARSE_COOKIE_OK:\n    break;\n  case MHD_PARSE_COOKIE_OK_LAX:\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    if (saved_tail != connection->rq.headers_received_tail)\n      MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n                _ (\"The Cookie header has been parsed, but it is not fully \"\n                   \"compliant with the standard.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n    break;\n  case MHD_PARSE_COOKIE_MALFORMED:\n    if (saved_tail != connection->rq.headers_received_tail)\n    {\n      if (! allow_partially_correct_cookie)\n      {\n        /* Remove extracted values from partially broken cookie */\n        /* Memory remains allocated until the end of the request processing */\n        connection->rq.headers_received_tail = saved_tail;\n        saved_tail->next = NULL;\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n        MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n                  _ (\"The Cookie header has been ignored as it contains \"\n                     \"malformed data.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n      }\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n      else\n        MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n                  _ (\"The Cookie header has been only partially parsed as it \"\n                     \"contains malformed data.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n    }\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    else\n      MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n                _ (\"The Cookie header has malformed data.\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n    break;\n  case MHD_PARSE_COOKIE_NO_MEMORY:\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Not enough memory in the connection pool to \"\n                 \"parse client cookies!\\n\"));\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n    break;\n  default:\n    mhd_assert (0);\n    break;\n  }\n#ifndef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  (void) saved_tail; /* Mute compiler warning */\n#endif /* !
