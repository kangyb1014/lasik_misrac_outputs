  "explanation": "I found no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The rule forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself (reassigning the parameter variable), while permitting modification of the object pointed to. In parse_cookies_string:\n\n- There are assignments that write into the buffer pointed to by the parameter str (e.g. str[name_start + name_len] = 0 and str[value_start + value_len] = 0). Those modify the pointee, not the pointer variable, which is allowed by the rule.\n- The parameter str_len is declared const and is not assigned to anywhere.\n- The parameter connection is dereferenced and the pointed-to object is modified (and is passed to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_), but the pointer variable connection itself is never reassigned.\n\nTherefore there are no direct modifications of the pointer parameters (no statements like str = ..., connection = ..., or similar) to flag for investigation under Rule 17.8."
