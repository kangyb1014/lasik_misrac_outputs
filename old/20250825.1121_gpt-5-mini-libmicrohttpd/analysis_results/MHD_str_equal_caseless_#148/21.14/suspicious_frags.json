  "explanation": "I found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code. The target function MHD_str_equal_caseless_ implements a character-by-character comparison that checks for the terminating NUL and advances both pointers; the helper functions (charsequalcaseless and isasciiupper) are inline and do not call memcmp. There are no calls to memcmp or any obvious memcmp-like usage in the supplied fragments, so there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the given code. (If there are other files or calls outside the provided snippets, those would need to be checked separately.)"
