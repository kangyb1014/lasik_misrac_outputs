  "explanation": "The rule targets modification of function parameters. The only places in the provided code that modify the parameter variables themselves are the pointer increments above. Other code fragments do not modify the parameters: reading from *str1 and *str2, assigning those values to local variables (const char c1 = *str1; const char c2 = *str2;), calling helper functions (charsequalcaseless, isasciiupper) that take arguments by value, and the return statements only inspect data. The parameters are declared as pointers to const, so the pointed-to objects are not modified anywhere in this function; only the pointer variables are advanced at the two increment statements listed."
