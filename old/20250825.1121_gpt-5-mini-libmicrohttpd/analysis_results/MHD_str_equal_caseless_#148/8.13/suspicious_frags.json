  "explanation": "No pointer-to-non-const occurrences were found that would trigger Rule 8.13. The function MHD_str_equal_caseless_ declares its parameters as const char *str1 and const char *str2, so the pointers already point to const-qualified targets. There are no other pointer parameters or pointer variables in the provided code that refer to non-const data. The helper functions take char parameters by value (charsequalcaseless uses const char by value; isasciiupper takes a char by value) \u2014 value parameters are not pointer targets and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13. The pointer increments (str1++/str2++) modify the pointer objects, not the pointed-to types; this does not violate the requirement that pointees be const-qualified when possible. Therefore there are no code fragments requiring investigation for Rule 8.13 in the supplied code."
