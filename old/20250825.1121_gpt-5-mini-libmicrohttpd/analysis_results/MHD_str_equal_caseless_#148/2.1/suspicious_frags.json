  "explanation": "I did not find any code fragments that are provably unreachable in the provided code. Reasoning by fragment:\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_: The while loop condition (0 != (*str1)) allows entry when str1 points to a non\u2011NUL character and exit when it reaches the NUL terminator. Inside the loop both outcomes of the if (charsequalcaseless (c1, c2)) are reachable: when characters compare equal the then-branch increments the pointers; when they do not compare equal the else-branch returns 0. The final return (0 == (*str2)) is reached whenever the loop exits normally (i.e., when *str1 == '\\0'), so it is not unreachable.\n\n- charsequalcaseless: The top-level logical structure (c1 == c2) || (condition ? branch1 : branch2) contains branches that depend on the runtime values of c1 and c2. The ternary selects branch1 when isasciiupper(c1) is true and branch2 otherwise; both branches can be taken for different inputs, so neither is dead code. The initial (c1 == c2) clause can also be true independently and is reachable for equal characters.\n\n- isasciiupper: The function returns a simple relational test (c >= 'A') && (c <= 'Z'); both true and false outcomes are reachable for different input characters.\n\nThere are no constant false conditions, no code textually following guaranteed-returning statements that cannot be reached, nor any unreachable labels or functions in the supplied snippets. Potential issues outside the scope of MISRA Rule 2.1 (for example: signedness of char causing surprising arithmetic or undefined behavior on dereferencing NULL pointers passed as arguments) do not by themselves make code unreachable; they would be matters for other MISRA rules and should be checked separately."
