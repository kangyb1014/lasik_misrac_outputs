  "explanation": "I did not flag other fragments because they use only standard C language constructs: the MHD_str_equal_caseless_ function uses pointer dereference, while loop, const char local variables, simple increments, function calls, and return expressions \u2014 all standard C. The arithmetic on char and character comparisons are implementation-defined in behaviour for signed/unsigned char but are not compiler language extensions per se. Identifier naming (leading underscore in identifiers) and the use of ternary/conditional operators are also standard language features. The reason the two function declarations above were singled out is that the _MHD_static_inline macro and the bare use of 'bool' in those declarations may map to compiler-specific keywords or macros (for example __inline__, __attribute__, or non-standard type aliases) depending on the build configuration; those expansions are the only likely places where compiler-specific language extensions would appear. No other code tokens in the provided fragments are known compiler-specific extensions."
