  "explanation": "No invariant controlling expressions were found. Specific control expressions and why they are not invariant:\n- while (0 != (*str1)): the loop condition depends on *str1 and str1 is incremented (str1++) inside the loop, so the expression can change and is not invariant.\n- if (charsequalcaseless (c1, c2)): the if condition depends on c1 and c2 which are loaded from the pointers str1/str2 and str2 (and str1) may change; c1/c2 are local values that vary with the loop, so the condition is not invariant.\n- The conditional operator inside charsequalcaseless uses isasciiupper(c1) as its controlling expression; it depends on c1 (a function parameter) and thus is not invariant across calls.\n- No other control constructs (for, do-while, switch) with constant/compile-time constant conditions are present. The loop is not an intentional infinite loop with a constant true condition nor is there a do-while with a constant false condition that would fit the listed exceptions.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for Rule 14.3 in the provided code."
