  "explanation": "To determine whether ws_get_accept_value violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, an analyzer must examine any symbol that could itself call or expand to memcmp or that affects how strings are created/compared in this path. The required symbols: \n\n- SHA1Reset: callee of ws_get_accept_value \u2014 its implementation must be checked for any use of memcmp on NUL-terminated strings. \n- SHA1Input: callee (and entry point to SHA1 processing) \u2014 may call other functions (e.g., SHA1ProcessMessageBlock) that could use memcmp. \n- SHA1Result: callee that finalizes the hash \u2014 it calls SHA1PadMessage; its implementation must be inspected for memcmp usage. \n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: called by SHA1Input \u2014 included because internals of the SHA1 implementation might use memcmp. \n- SHA1PadMessage: called by SHA1Result \u2014 included for the same reason. \n- BASE64Encode: callee that performs encoding and writes to *val \u2014 must be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings. Also its return/behavior affects whether a NUL is written and whether comparisons could occur. \n- strlen: standard library call used on key; its presence means the analyzer should ensure no indirect use of memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings via wrapper implementations or macros. \n- strncpy: used to assemble str from key and WS_GUID; although not memcmp, the resulting buffer handling affects whether other functions might perform string comparisons \u2014 check any wrapper that might call memcmp. \n- malloc: allocation used for str \u2014 included so the analyzer can follow any custom allocator wrappers that might call memcmp (rare, but necessary for complete call-chain analysis). \n- free: paired deallocation; included for completeness of call-chain analysis. \n- WS_KEY_LEN: constant governing length and buffer operations; value and definition are needed to determine whether the code treats key as NUL-terminated and therefore whether any comparisons could involve NUL-terminated strings. \n- WS_GUID_LEN: length of GUID appended \u2014 needed to reason about string assembly and termination. \n- WS_KEY_GUID_LEN: combined length passed to SHA1Input \u2014 needed to confirm the number of bytes hashed (distinguishes binary vs NUL-terminated string usage). \n- WS_GUID: the appended constant string \u2014 its definition (NUL-terminated or not) is needed to determine whether subsequent operations treat it as a NUL-terminated string. \n- SHA1HashSize: size of the hash passed to BASE64Encode \u2014 needed to follow data sizes rather than string semantics. \n- SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS: return code compared against SHA1Result's return value \u2014 needed only to fully inspect SHA1Result return paths (to find any memcmp usage). \n- MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: return type and constants used by ws_get_accept_value \u2014 included so an analyzer has the full context for the function behavior and return-value-driven control flow when inspecting callers/callees for memcmp usage.\n\nIn short, any callee implementation (SHA1* functions and BASE64Encode) and any macros/definitions that affect whether data is treated as NUL-terminated strings (WS_* constants and standard string functions used) must be available to determine if memcmp is used to compare NUL-terminated strings along this call chain."
