The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (concise):\n\n- SHA1Reset: implementation may contain for-loops or setup that interacts with SHA1Context counters; needed because it is invoked from ws_get_accept_value and any for-loops inside it must be checked for MISRA well-formedness.\n\n- SHA1Input: implementation is called directly and its body (or callees) may contain for-loops. It calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock; we must inspect it to ensure any for-statements meet the MISRA rule.\n\n- SHA1Result: called by ws_get_accept_value; its implementation may contain for-loops and calls SHA1PadMessage \u2014 both must be inspected for well-formed for-loops.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: callee of SHA1Input. Because the behaviour of functions called inside a for loop matters, and because SHA1 routines commonly contain index-based loops, include its source to verify loop counters and side effects.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage: callee of SHA1Result. Include to inspect any internal for-loops for correct loop-counter usage and absence of side effects on other objects.\n\n- BASE64Encode: called after hashing; it very likely contains loops (encoding byte arrays to base64). The function's implementation must be examined to ensure any for-loops are well-formed per MISRA.\n\n- struct SHA1Context (definition): SHA1 functions manipulate fields of this structure; loop counters or flags used inside SHA1* implementations may be members or depend on its layout. Need the definition to understand how loops iterate and what objects they modify.\n\n- SHA1HashSize (macro): size passed into BASE64Encode and used in SHA1Result; required to reason about loop bounds in SHA1/B64 code.\n\n- WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID_LEN, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN, WS_GUID: these macros/constants determine buffer sizes and the length argument passed to SHA1Input. They can affect loop bounds in SHA1Input/BASE64Encode and therefore are necessary to check loop counter initialization, bounds and whether other objects are modified in loop bodies.\n\n- MHD_Result enum and values (MHD_YES, MHD_NO): included for completeness so the analyzer knows return-value semantics; not directly tied to for-loop formation but required to fully understand function behaviour and control flow.\n\n- malloc, free, strlen, strncpy: standard library calls used by the target. While their documented behaviour is usually sufficient, include them so the analyzer can (if needed) inspect their implementations for loops (or at least confirm they are not introducing relevant loop-counter modifications or side effects affecting MISRA analysis).\n\nNotes: The target function itself contains no for-statements. To determine MISRA compliance we must therefore inspect any called functions (and their callees) that may contain for-statements \u2014 hence SHA1* implementations and BASE64Encode and the related size/constants/struct definitions are essential. Standard library symbols are included for completeness in case their implementations are within scope for the compliance check."
