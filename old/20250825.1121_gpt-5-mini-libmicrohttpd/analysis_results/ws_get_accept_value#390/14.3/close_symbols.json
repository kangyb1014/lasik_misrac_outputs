  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for assessing whether any controlling expression in ws_get_accept_value is invariant under MISRA C:\n\n- WS_KEY_LEN\n  Needed because it appears in the controlling expression (WS_KEY_LEN != strlen(key)). If WS_KEY_LEN were itself a macro or expression that makes the comparison constant the condition could be invariant. You must know its definition/value.\n\n- WS_GUID_LEN\n  Needed because it participates in buffer sizing and in computing WS_KEY_GUID_LEN; its value can affect the lengths passed to SHA1Input and strncpy which in turn affect whether subsequent function calls/returns (and their condition checks) are constant.\n\n- WS_KEY_GUID_LEN\n  Used as the length argument to SHA1Input. If this constant is incorrect or constant in a way that makes SHA1Input/SHA1Result behavior constant, the controlling expression on SHA1Result could become invariant. Must know its value.\n\n- WS_GUID\n  The GUID string concatenated to key affects the data hashed by SHA1Input. If WS_GUID were empty or constant in a way that makes the hash computation deterministic in a way that makes SHA1Result return a constant status, the SHA1Result controlling expression could be effectively invariant.\n\n- SHA1HashSize\n  Defines the size of the hash buffer passed to BASE64Encode; knowledge of its value is needed to reason about BASE64Encode behavior and whether BASE64Encode can ever return -1 (the controlling expression checking -1 == len).\n\n- SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS\n  The comparison (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS != SHA1Result(...)) depends on this constant. Its value and meaning are required to determine if the comparison can be invariant.\n\n- SHA1Reset\n  Included because it initializes SHA1Context; understanding its semantics (does it always succeed, change ctx deterministically, or have side effects) is necessary to reason whether downstream calls produce invariant results.\n\n- SHA1Input\n  SHA1Input is called with the concatenated string and length; its behavior (return code/side-effects, whether it can fail or always succeed) affects whether SHA1Result's return is invariant.\n\n- SHA1Result\n  Directly appears in a controlling expression. Its implementation and possible return values (and whether it can ever differ from SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS given the inputs) are essential to determine whether the controlling expression is invariant.\n\n- BASE64Encode\n  Its return value is checked against -1. You must know its semantics: under what conditions it returns -1 or a non-negative length, or whether it is guaranteed to succeed (which would make the -1 test invariant).\n\n- strlen\n  Appears in the first controlling expression. Must confirm this is the standard runtime strlen (depends on key) and whether any analysis of callers could make strlen(key) a compile-time/invariant value.\n\n- malloc\n  The allocation result is tested for NULL. If the runtime environment or malloc wrapper always returns non-NULL or always NULL in this build/configuration, the NULL check could be invariant. Knowledge of malloc semantics/wrappers in this codebase is required.\n\n- strncpy\n  Used to build the string passed to SHA1Input. Its semantics (how it handles termination and lengths) can affect the data hashed and thus SHA1Result behavior; relevant when determining invariance of SHA1Result's outcome.\n\n- free\n  Present in the error paths; generally not directly related to controlling expressions, but included to ensure any wrappers or macros that change control flow (e.g., freeing sets globals) are considered.\n\n- ahc_cb\n  The caller of ws_get_accept_value. To decide whether the first controlling expression can be invariant you need to know how ws_get_accept_value is called (what values of key are ever passed). If ahc_cb always passes a key of a fixed length or a compile-time constant pointer, that may make (WS_KEY_LEN != strlen(key)) invariant.\n\nIn short: to determine whether any of the if-conditions in ws_get_accept_value are invariant you must inspect the compile-time constants (WS_*), the caller behavior (ahc_cb and how it supplies key), and the implementations/semantics of the SHA1 and BASE64 routines (their possible return values). The listed symbols are the minimal set required to make that determination."
