  "explanation": "The other pointer-related fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - The parameter key is already declared as const char * so it satisfies the rule. - The local array unsigned char hash[SHA1HashSize] is written by the SHA1Result routine (it holds the digest), so its pointee must be mutable and cannot be const-qualified. - The buffer referenced by str is written to (str is populated via strncpy and constructed before being hashed), so the pointed-to characters must be modifiable; making str point to const data would be inappropriate. - The calls to strncpy and malloc operate on a writable buffer and therefore require a non-const target. - The SHA1Input call casts the buffer to const for a read-only API; that cast is consistent with passing a mutable buffer to a function expecting a const-qualified pointer and does not indicate a missing const qualification in declarations."
