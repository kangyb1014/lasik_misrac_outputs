  "explanation": "Include each function reachable from MHD_run_wait (direct callees and their callees) and the immediate caller MHD_run because MISRA recursion (no direct or indirect self-call) requires checking whether any of these functions call back into MHD_run_wait or into MHD_run (which calls MHD_run_wait). Specific reasons:\n\n- MHD_poll_all: directly called by MHD_run_wait when USING_POLL; must check whether it (or descendants) call back to MHD_run_wait/MHD_run.\n- MHD_cleanup_connections: directly invoked after poll/epoll; its internals could call higher-level functions that form a recursion cycle.\n- MHD_epoll: directly called by MHD_run_wait when USING_EPOLL; must be inspected for callbacks into MHD_run_wait/MHD_run.\n- MHD_select: directly called by MHD_run_wait when USING_SELECT; its implementation or callees may call back.\n- resume_suspended_connections: callee of poll/epoll/select; include to ensure it does not call back upward.\n- MHD_DLOG: logging function called from several callees; include to rule out unexpected callbacks (or macros that expand to calls).\n- get_timeout_millisec_int: helper called by poll/epoll; include to check for any unexpected control-flow to MHD_run_wait.\n- new_connections_list_process_: called by poll/epoll; include to check for callbacks (e.g., re-entering run loop).\n- MHD_accept_connection: called by poll/epoll; accept handlers might trigger code that re-enters the daemon run function.\n- call_handlers: invoked by poll/epoll; handler implementations or wrapper could indirectly re-enter run.\n- __builtin_unreachable: appears in cleanup graph; include for completeness though it doesn't cause recursion.\n- cleanup_upgraded_connection: called from cleanup path; include because cleanup may call higher-level APIs that re-enter run.\n- MHD_pool_destroy: resource cleanup function; include to ensure no hidden re-entry.\n- MHD_ip_limit_del: cleanup helper; include to check for re-entry.\n- MHD_destroy_response: cleanup helper; include to check for re-entry.\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle: callee of epoll; include to ensure it doesn't call back to run.\n- internal_get_fdset2: callee of select; include because fdset helpers might interact with run-loop code.\n- MHD_add_to_fd_set_: helper used by select; include to ensure no callbacks.\n- MHD_get_timeout64: timeout helper used by select; include to ensure no callbacks.\n- internal_run_from_select: invoked by select; this is a likely candidate to call higher-level run logic \u2014 must be checked for recursion to MHD_run_wait/MHD_run.\n- MHD_poll: caller of MHD_poll_all (from static graph); include to inspect its potential to call MHD_run_wait/MHD_run.\n- MHD_run_from_select2: listed caller in graph for epoll/cleanup; include because it could call MHD_run or otherwise form a cycle.\n- MHD_polling_thread: listed caller of several of these functions; include because thread entry points might re-enter run.\n- MHD_add_connection: caller of cleanup_connections; include because connection-adding code might re-enter run.\n- close_all_connections: caller of cleanup_connections; include to ensure no circular calls.\n- MHD_get_daemon_info: caller of cleanup_connections; include for same reason.\n- MHD_run: caller of MHD_run_wait \u2014 include to detect indirect recursion (e.g., callee chain -> MHD_run -> MHD_run_wait).\n\nIn short: to determine whether MHD_run_wait violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls, the next analysis must examine every function MHD_run_wait calls (and their transitive callees) plus MHD_run (the caller) to ensure no path exists from any of these functions back to MHD_run_wait or MHD_run."
