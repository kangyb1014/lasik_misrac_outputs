  "scenario": "This call passes the literal NULL for the third parameter; no pointer variable is declared here. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations/parameter types that should be const-qualified. The fragment itself does not violate Rule 8.13. If the prototype/definition of get_no_space_err_status_code declared the corresponding parameter as a non-const pointer even though the function does not modify the pointee, that would be a violation \u2014 but that violation would be in the function's declaration/definition, not in this call site."
