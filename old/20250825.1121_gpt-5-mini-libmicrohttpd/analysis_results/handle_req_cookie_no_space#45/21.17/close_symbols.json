  "explanation": "For a correct MISRA <string.h> bounds analysis you must inspect not only handle_req_cookie_no_space but also the functions and data it passes buffers/strings into and the string constant used. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- get_no_space_err_status_code: Called directly to obtain err_code; its implementation may look up connection values or manipulate strings (cookies) and could call string.h functions leading to out-of-bounds accesses.\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: Called by get_no_space_err_status_code (per call graph). It likely reads connection header/cookie buffers; its implementation must be inspected for any memcpy/strlen/etc. that could overflow.\n- MHD_PROC_RECV_COOKIE: The enum/constant passed into get_no_space_err_status_code \u2014 needed to understand which connection field is read and therefore which buffer(s) and lengths are subject to string ops.\n- transmit_error_response_static and transmit_error_response_len: The target calls transmit_error_response_* to build/send the error response. These wrappers construct responses from provided strings/buffers and are likely to call string.h functions; you must inspect their implementations.\n- ERR_MSG_REQUEST_HEADER_WITH_COOKIES_TOO_BIG: The error message string passed into transmit_error_response_* \u2014 its representation and how its length is computed/passed (e.g. using strlen or sizeof) are directly relevant to detecting out-of-bounds string ops.\n- MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static: Frequently used by transmit_error_response_* to create a response from a buffer pointer+length. You must check how the length is computed/validated and whether the function copies or references the buffer unsafely.\n- build_header_response: Called during response construction; may concatenate headers or copy strings (headers, content-length, etc.) and thus a potential site for unsafe string.h use.\n- MHD_pool_deallocate and MHD_pool_reset: Memory pool operations used during response building/teardown; if buffers are returned to pools or reused without proper length bookkeeping, string operations could be applied to invalid/undersized buffers.\n- MHD_destroy_response: Destroys response objects; may free or touch internal string buffers \u2014 inspect for any string ops used during teardown that assume buffer sizes.\n- MHD_queue_response: Queues the response to the connection; may format or copy headers/content \u2014 inspect for string operations that could overrun buffers passed in.\n- MHD_DLOG and connection_close_error: Logging and error-close helpers invoked by transmit_error_response_*; logging functions commonly format strings and could call snprintf/strncpy/strlen \u2014 include to check for unsafe use.\n- struct MHD_Connection: The connection object passed into handle_req_cookie_no_space and into get_no_space_err_status_code / lookup function\u2014its layout and buffer fields (cookie/header storage and lengths) are needed to assess whether string functions operate within bounds.\n- struct MHD_Response: Response object type returned/used by create/destroy functions; needed to follow ownership/length of any buffers used when creating responses.\n- MHD pool/type definitions (e.g. MHD_Pool): Types and semantics of the pool API used by the transmit/create/destroy routines affect buffer lifetime and sizing assumptions; include to verify that pool-based buffers are used safely.\n\nIn short: to decide whether handle_req_cookie_no_space (directly or indirectly) causes out-of-bounds string.h calls you must examine the implementations and type definitions of the called helpers, the exact error message buffer, and the connection/response buffer layouts and pool semantics. The symbols above point to those relevant implementations and types."
