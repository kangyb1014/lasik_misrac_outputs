  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. I inspected the code for common compiler-specific extensions (for example: __attribute__, __extension__, __asm, typeof, __builtin_*, GCC/Clang pragmas, vendor keywords, or nonstandard storage-class/function-specifiers) and found none. Specific notes:\n- The (void)parameter idiom is standard C to suppress unused-parameter warnings, not a compiler extension.\n- Enum usage (enum MHD_Result and constants MHD_NO/MHD_YES) is standard C.\n- The use of size_t, void*, pointer-to-pointer, string literal comparisons (strcmp), and preprocessor macro MHD_HTTP_OK are all standard C constructs.\n- No vendor-specific keywords or constructs appear in the snippet.\n\nThere are other issues that are not language extensions (e.g., the identifier response used in the return expression is not defined in the snippet, and MHD_queue_response is referenced without a visible prototype), but these are not violations of MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (they are semantic/visibility problems rather than use of compiler extensions) and therefore are not reported here."
