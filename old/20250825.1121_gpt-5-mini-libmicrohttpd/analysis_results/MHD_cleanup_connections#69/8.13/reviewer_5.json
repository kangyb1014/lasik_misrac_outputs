True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nIf the MHD_ip_limit_del function is declared to take a non-const pointer type (for example: void MHD_ip_limit_del(struct MHD_Daemon *d, void *addr, size_t len)) while it does not modify the memory pointed to by addr, then Rule 8.13 is violated. In that case pos->addr (likely declared as a non-const pointer) is passed where a const-qualified pointer should be used; the correct declaration would be something like: void MHD_ip_limit_del(struct MHD_Daemon *d, const void *addr, size_t len). If, however, MHD_ip_limit_del is actually declared to take a const-qualified pointer or it legitimately modifies the memory, then there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report describes a plausible MISRA Rule 8.13 violation but it cannot be confirmed from the code snippet alone. Rule 8.13 requires pointer types to be const-qualified whenever possible \u2014 that includes function parameters that do not modify the pointed-to data. The code passes pos->addr to MHD_ip_limit_del; a violation would occur only if the MHD_ip_limit_del prototype takes a non-const pointer (e.g. void *addr) while the function does not modify the memory, or if pos->addr itself should be declared with const but is not.\n\nTherefore the claim is conditionally correct: if MHD_ip_limit_del is declared to take a non-const pointer and it does not modify the data, then the code (or the function prototype) should be changed to use a const-qualified pointer and that would be a Rule 8.13 violation as reported. If, however, MHD_ip_limit_del already takes a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void *), or if the function legitimately modifies the memory, then there is no violation. To resolve this, inspect the declaration/definition of MHD_ip_limit_del and the intent for pos->addr and adjust the const qualification accordingly."
