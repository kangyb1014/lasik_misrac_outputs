No other calls to the Standard Library string handling functions (memmove, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the supplied fragments, so there are no additional locations to investigate under this rule. Other code in the snippet (allocation/free, socket/epoll/gnutls calls, list manipulation, assertions, mutexes, etc.) does not invoke <string.h> functions and therefore is not relevant to Rule 21.17 and need not be investigated here."
