First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Only for-statements are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The provided code contains two for-loops (the outer language_idx loop and the nested category_idx loop) which should be inspected to ensure: the first clause sets/initialises the loop counter, the second clause has no persistent side-effects and uses only the loop counter (or an allowed loop-control flag), and the third clause modifies only the loop counter and does not touch objects modified in the loop body. Other code fragments need not be investigated for this rule: - The while loop in list_directory (while (NULL != (de = readdir (dir)))) is not a for-loop and thus not subject to Rule 14.2. - The calls to snprintf, stat, list_directory, malloc/realloc/free, and other function calls within the loop bodies are relevant to side-effects inside the body but are not for-statements themselves; their effects should be considered when investigating the flagged for-loops (e.g. ensuring the second/third clauses do not reference objects modified by those calls). - Declarations and static arrays (languages, categories) are constant data and not for-statements, so they are not direct targets of Rule 14.2. - There are no other for-statements in the supplied code to inspect. Therefore the two for-loop fragments above are the only constructs that need to be investigated for compliance with Rule 14.2."
