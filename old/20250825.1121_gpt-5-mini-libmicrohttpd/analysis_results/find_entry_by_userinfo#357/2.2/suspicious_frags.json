The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other parts of the function are not flagged because they do not by themselves indicate dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2: the function signature and storage class (static) are normal and do not represent executable statements that could be removed without effect; the return expressions (calls to find_entry_by_username / find_entry_by_userhash) are active calls whose removal would change behavior; there are no initializations or assignments that would be considered dead code; and there is no unreachable code (code that cannot be executed) elsewhere in the snippet. The suspicious fragments above are the only places where control-flow/conditions and an explicit fallback return suggest possible dead code or unreachable/always-taken branches that require investigation."
