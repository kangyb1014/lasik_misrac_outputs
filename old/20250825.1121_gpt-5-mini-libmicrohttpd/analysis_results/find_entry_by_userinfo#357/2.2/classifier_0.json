Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of find_entry_by_userinfo:\n```c\nstatic struct UserEntry *\nfind_entry_by_userinfo (const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info)\n{\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_username (username_info->username);\n\n  if (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH == username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_userhash (username_info->algo3,\n                                   username_info->userhash_bin,\n                                   username_info->userhash_hex_len / 2);\n\n  return NULL; /* Should be unreachable as all cases are covered before */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type)\n    return find_entry_by_username (username_info->username);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not enough information to show a dead-code violation. The tested fragment itself is a conditional return and is only dead if it is executed but its removal would not change program behaviour (which is not established here). A potential problematic case is if MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD is 0 (or otherwise the minimum valid value) and username_info->uname_type is always >= that for all valid inputs (e.g. an unsigned enum with no values below STANDARD). Then the first branch will always be taken and the subsequent USERHASH branch and final return will be unreachable at run time. Note: unreachable code is not classified as \"dead code\" by MISRA Note 2, so the fragment as shown does not by itself prove a Rule 2.2 violation."
