  "scenario": "If the member userhash_bin in struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo is declared as a pointer to a non-const type (for example: unsigned char *userhash_bin), then this fragment violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameter is being passed a pointer that should be to const-qualified data because username_info is a pointer to const struct; the pointed-to data should therefore be declared const (e.g. const unsigned char *userhash_bin) to prevent modification. If, however, userhash_bin is already declared as a pointer to const (or find_entry_by_userhash expects a pointer-to-const), then there is no violation."
