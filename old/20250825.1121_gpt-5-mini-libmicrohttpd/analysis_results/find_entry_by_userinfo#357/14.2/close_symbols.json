The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function violates the MISRA rule about well-formed for loops you must examine any for loops that are part of the function or are executed as part of calls made by the function. The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n- find_entry_by_username (definition): the target directly calls this; inspect its body for any for statements and verify their three clauses, loop counters, and side effects.\n- find_entry_by_userhash (definition): the target directly calls this; inspect its body for for statements and any modifications to objects that might affect loop clauses in callers.\n- MHD_digest_get_hash_size (definition): called by find_entry_by_userhash per the call graph; its body may contain for loops or modify objects used as loop counters/flags in ancestor calls and must be examined.\n- struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo (type definition): the target reads fields (uname_type, username, algo3, userhash_bin, userhash_hex_len). Their types determine whether any of these objects could act as loop counters or be modified in called functions (relevant to clause 2/3 of the rule).\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD (macro/enum) and MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH (macro/enum): their values/types clarify the control flow and whether uname_type-related objects could behave as loop control flags or counters.\n- struct UserEntry (type definition): target returns pointers to this type; while not directly tied to for-loop formation, its definition can reveal if returned objects alias or share storage with objects used as loop counters in called code (relevant when analysing side effects).\n\nInclude the full definitions/bodies (not only prototypes) of the functions and the complete type/macro definitions above so the next analyst can inspect any for loops, identify loop counters and flags, and check for modifications to those objects inside loop bodies (including through called functions)."
