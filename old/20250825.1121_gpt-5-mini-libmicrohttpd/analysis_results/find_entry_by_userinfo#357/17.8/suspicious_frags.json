  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameter is a pointer declared as const (const struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info), so all uses in the function are read-only. The code only reads members (username_info->uname_type, username_info->username, username_info->algo3, username_info->userhash_bin, username_info->userhash_hex_len) and performs comparisons or passes member values to other functions; there are no assignments to the parameter variable itself (no statements like username_info = ...), nor any writes to the pointed-to object. The arithmetic expression (userhash_hex_len / 2) only reads the member and does not modify it. Therefore Rule 17.8 is not violated in this function."
