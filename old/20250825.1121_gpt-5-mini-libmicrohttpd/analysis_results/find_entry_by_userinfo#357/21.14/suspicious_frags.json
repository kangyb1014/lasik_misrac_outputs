  "explanation": "The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The only memcmp occurrences in the provided code are the three fragments listed above, so they must be investigated. Other code fragments do not need investigation for this rule: find_entry_by_username uses strcmp (which is the appropriate string comparison function for null-terminated strings), the userhash members are explicitly documented as binary data (\"This is a binary data, no zero termination\") and prior size checks (MHD_digest_get_hash_size and explicit sizeof checks) ensure memcmp is applied to fixed-size binary buffers rather than C-style null-terminated strings. No other memcmp usages are present in the supplied code."
