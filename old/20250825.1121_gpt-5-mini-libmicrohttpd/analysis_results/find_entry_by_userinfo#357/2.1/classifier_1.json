  "scenario": "The second branch can be statically unreachable depending on the enum ordering. If the enum values are ordered such that MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH (e.g. STANDARD=0, EXTENDED=1, USERHASH=2), then the first test (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD <= username_info->uname_type) evaluates true for USERHASH as well, so the USERHASH-specific if is never reached and thus is unreachable code. This constitutes a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
