  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown code path: find_entry_by_userhash first validates that userhash_size == MHD_digest_get_hash_size(algo3) and then that sizeof(entry->userhash_sha512_256) == userhash_size before reaching the memcmp call. The memcmp length equals sizeof(entry->userhash_sha512_256), so both operands are guaranteed to have that many bytes (the entry array is statically sized; the userhash buffer is required by the surrounding code/structure to be userhash_size bytes when uname_type == userhash). However, if the caller/structure invariants were violated (e.g. username_info->userhash_bin == NULL or userhash_hex_len/2 does not reflect the actual buffer length), then memcmp could read out of bounds \u2014 that would be a violating scenario."
