  "explanation": "I selected all conditional return statements and the preprocessor-guarded blocks (assert and mutex lock/unlock) plus the DLL remove/insert operations. These locations are where code reachability depends either on runtime conditions (the various if (...) return; checks) or on build-time configuration (the #if / #endif guarded lines). They therefore merit investigation to determine whether any of those fragments can become truly unreachable in some build/configuration or due to logic errors. Other fragments in the function (declaration of daemon, the assignment connection->last_activity = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter(); and the surrounding comments) are straightforward, are reachable when none of the conditional returns fire, and do not by themselves constitute unreachable code, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 2.1."
