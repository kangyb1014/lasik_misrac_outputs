  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided code fragment. The snippet only uses standard C constructs: function definition, pointer accesses, comparisons, assignments, return statements, preprocessor conditionals (#if defined / #endif), and calls to functions or macros. I specifically checked for common compiler/vendor extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, including but not limited to: __attribute__ or __declspec, __builtin_* identifiers, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly (__asm__), nested functions, GNU or MSVC-specific keywords, and other documented compiler extensions. The macro and function names that end with underscores (for example MHD_update_last_activity_, MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, XDLL_remove) are ordinary identifiers and not compiler extensions. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments requiring further investigation under Rule 1.2."
