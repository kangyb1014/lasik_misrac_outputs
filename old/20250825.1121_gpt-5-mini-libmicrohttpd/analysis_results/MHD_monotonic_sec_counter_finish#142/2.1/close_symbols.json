  "explanation": "HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME: The preprocessor macro controls whether the entire if-block is compiled. To decide if any code in the function can be unreachable you must know whether this macro is defined in the build configuration or headers.\n\nmono_clock_service: The run-time value (declaration, initialiser and all assignments) of this variable determines whether the if-condition can ever be true. If mono_clock_service is always equal to _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV then the inner deallocation call is dead/unreachable; if it can differ then the call may be reachable.\n\n_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV: The constant (definition) used in the comparison is required to reason about the condition. Its type and value (and any macros used to define it) determine whether the comparison can ever be true.\n\nmach_port_deallocate: The callee inside the guarded block: its declaration or macro definition is needed to confirm the call is not a macro that expands away (which could affect reachability/observability) and to check whether calls to it are permitted/used elsewhere that affect whether the block is meaningful.\n\nmach_task_self: The argument expression used in the deallocate call \u2014 include its declaration/macro \u2014 because it might be a macro/function that affects whether the call is retained/optimized away or has side effects that influence reachability analysis.\n\nNote: To fully determine MISRA-unreachable-code compliance you must examine the translation unit(s) and build preprocessor definitions (headers, compile flags) to resolve the above symbols and all assignments to mono_clock_service."
