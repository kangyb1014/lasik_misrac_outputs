  "explanation": "- HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME: Controls whether the body of MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish is compiled. To determine if any string.h functions are present in the compiled code, the conditional compilation symbol must be known.\n- mono_clock_service: Global variable tested and updated by the function. Knowing its type and semantics lets you confirm it is not a pointer to a string buffer or otherwise involved in string.h operations.\n- _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV: The sentinel value compared against mono_clock_service. Its type and value are needed to understand the comparison and assignment semantics and to ensure no string buffers are involved.\n- mach_port_deallocate: External system call invoked inside the function. To rule out indirect use of string.h functions, its declaration/definition must be inspected to see whether it or any wrappers call string handling routines.\n- mach_task_self: External function/macro used as first argument to mach_port_deallocate. Its definition must be checked for any use of string.h functions.\n- mach_port_t / mach_port_name_t (Mach IPC types): The types used by the Mach functions\u2014knowing these ensures the arguments are numeric/port identifiers rather than pointers to character buffers (which would be relevant to the MISRA string rule).\n\nTogether these symbols allow an analyst to determine (1) whether the function body is present in the build, (2) whether any objects manipulated could be strings/buffers, and (3) whether any called external functions might themselves use string.h functions \u2014 all necessary to decide compliance with the MISRA string-handling rule."
