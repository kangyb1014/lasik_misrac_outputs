  "explanation": "The function contains no calls to any of the standard <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The code only performs conditional checks, a mach_port_deallocate call, mach_task_self(), and an assignment to mono_clock_service. None of these involve the string handling routines or operations that could cause out-of-bounds accesses of objects via string.h pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 21.17 compliance."
