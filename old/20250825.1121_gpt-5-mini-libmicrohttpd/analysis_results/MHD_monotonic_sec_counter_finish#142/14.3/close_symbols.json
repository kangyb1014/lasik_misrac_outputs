  "explanation": "mono_clock_service: The controlling expression compares this variable to _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV. To decide whether the expression is invariant you must know the variable\u2019s declaration (type, storage class, initialiser, and qualifiers such as volatile/atomic) and every place it is written (assignment sites, initialization, or side-effecting APIs). If mono_clock_service is never modified (or is const) the if condition is invariant and may violate MISRA. _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV: The value and type of this macro/constant are needed to determine whether the comparison can ever be true or false (e.g. a compile-time constant equal to mono_clock_service\u2019s initializer makes the expression invariant). HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME: This configuration macro controls whether the if statement exists in the compiled code. If it is not defined the function is empty (no controlling expression to check); if defined the condition must be analysed. mach_port_t: If mono_clock_service uses a typedef (e.g. mach_port_t) the underlying type and semantics (integer-like, pointer-like) affect whether the comparison is meaningful and whether the value can change. mach_task_self and mach_port_deallocate: Provide their declarations/definitions to confirm they do not modify mono_clock_service (for example, if implemented as macros or inline helpers with side-effects); their presence could affect whether the variable is changed as part of this call sequence and thus whether the controlling expression can be invariant."
