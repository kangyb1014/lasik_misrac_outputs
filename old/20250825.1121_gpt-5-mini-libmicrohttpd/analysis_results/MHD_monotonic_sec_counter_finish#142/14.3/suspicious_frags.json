  "explanation": "Only the if statement contains a C controlling expression and therefore is the only fragment relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The #ifdef/#endif are preprocessor conditionals, not C controlling expressions covered by Rule 14.3. The function declaration/definition, the mach_port_deallocate call, and the assignment to mono_clock_service are not controlling expressions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do-while) or switch statements in this function, so no other controlling expressions exist that could be invariant."
