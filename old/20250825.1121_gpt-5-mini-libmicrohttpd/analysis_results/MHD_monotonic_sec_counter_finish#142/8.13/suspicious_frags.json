  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointer objects should be const-qualified. The only places in this function that reference identifiers or expressions that could be pointer objects (and thus possibly require const qualification) are the comparisons, calls and assignment involving mono_clock_service and the call to mach_task_self(). Other fragments in the function \u2014 the function signature, the #ifdef/#endif, the comment, and the surrounding braces \u2014 do not declare or manipulate pointer objects and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 8.13."
