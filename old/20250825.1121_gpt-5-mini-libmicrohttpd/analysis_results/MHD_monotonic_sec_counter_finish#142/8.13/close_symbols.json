  "explanation": "For MISRA rule about pointers pointing to const-qualified types, we must know which identifiers are pointer types and whether any pointer parameters/objects should be const. Each listed symbol is required for that determination:\n\n- mono_clock_service (declaration and type): the key variable tested/used in the function. We must know its exact type (is it a pointer type?) and its declaration to decide if it should be a pointer-to-const or otherwise qualified.\n\n- _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV (definition and type): the sentinel/value compared against mono_clock_service. Its type must match mono_clock_service; knowing its definition shows whether the comparison mixes pointer and non-pointer types or uses incompatible qualifiers.\n\n- mach_port_deallocate (prototype): the parameter types of this function call determine if mono_clock_service is being passed as a pointer or non-pointer and whether that API expects const-qualified pointers. The prototype reveals if const qualification is possible/required.\n\n- mach_task_self (prototype): its return type participates in the call and can indicate whether the mach APIs use pointer types; helps ensure the first argument's type is correct and whether any pointer conversions occur.\n\n- mach_port_t / mach_port_name_t typedefs (types used by mach APIs): these underlying typedefs show whether the mach_* symbols are pointer types or integer-like types; they are necessary to judge pointer const-qualification applicability.\n\n- HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME (macro definition): the conditional compilation macro determines whether the code is present in the build. To decide if the function can violate the rule in a given configuration we need to know whether this macro is defined in the analyzed build.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether any pointer is involved, whether const qualification is applicable, and whether the function causes non-const pointer usage that would violate the MISRA rule."
