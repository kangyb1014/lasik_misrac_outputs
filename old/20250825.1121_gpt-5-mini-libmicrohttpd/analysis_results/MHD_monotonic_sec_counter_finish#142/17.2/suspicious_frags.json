  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Analysis of the provided code:\n- MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish: does not call itself and contains only calls to external/system functions (mach_port_deallocate) and an assignment. There is no direct or indirect call to MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish from within itself.\n- MHD_fini: calls MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish, but MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish does not call MHD_fini (no reverse edge), so there is no mutual recursion.\n- There are no function pointers, callbacks, or other constructs in the provided fragments that could introduce an indirect call back to either function within the shown code.\n- Preprocessor conditionals do not add calls that would create recursion in the given snippets.\n\nExternal/library functions (gnutls_global_deinit, WSACleanup, mach_port_deallocate) are outside the provided code; without their definitions there is no basis to claim they call back into these functions. Given only the supplied code, there is no direct or indirect self-call to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
