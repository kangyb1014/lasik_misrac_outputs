  "explanation": "mono_clock_service \u2014 the global variable tested and assigned in the function; its declaration/type/value must be known to prove it is not a null\u2011terminated string (so memcmp would not be appropriate) and to detect any hidden string comparisons.\n\n_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV \u2014 the sentinel constant compared/assigned to mono_clock_service; its definition/type is needed to determine whether the comparison/assignment involves string semantics or could mask a memcmp use.\n\nmach_port_deallocate \u2014 the function (or macro) called inside the conditional; its definition must be checked to ensure it is not a macro or wrapper that internally uses memcmp on strings.\n\nmach_task_self \u2014 the function (or macro) used as an argument to mach_port_deallocate; its definition must be inspected in case it expands to code that performs string comparisons.\n\nHAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME \u2014 the compile\u2011time macro that controls whether the entire block is compiled; its value determines if the code path that might use memcmp is present at all.\n\n(These symbols are sufficient to determine whether the target function itself performs any string comparisons via memcmp or via macros/wrappers. There are no direct callees in the static call graph, so checking these definitions/decls is necessary to rule out indirect memcmp usage.)"
