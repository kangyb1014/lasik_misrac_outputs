  "explanation": "For deciding if MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish is dead code (i.e. its removal would not affect behaviour) you must know: \n\n- MHD_fini: The static graph shows MHD_fini calls this function. You must determine whether MHD_fini itself is ever invoked at runtime (entry points, shutdown paths). If MHD_fini is never called, the finish function is unreachable from program execution and likely dead (or at least never executed). \n\n- mono_clock_service: The function's body is conditional on the runtime value of this global. You need its declaration, initial value and all places that write to it to know whether the if-block can ever evaluate true and produce observable effects. If mono_clock_service is never set to a valid value, the body never executes and could be dead. \n\n- _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV: The sentinel used in the comparison. Its definition/value is required to interpret the comparison and to know what constitutes a \"valid\" service value. \n\n- mach_port_deallocate and mach_task_self: These calls are the observable side-effects inside the function (OS resource deallocation). To decide whether removing the function changes behaviour you must understand these calls' observable effects (resource management, errors, timing) and whether their omission would alter program behaviour. \n\n- HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME: The body is compiled only when this macro is defined. You must know the build configuration (whether this macro is ever defined) to know whether the function actually contains executable code in the produced binary. If the macro is not defined, the function is empty and may be dead. \n\n- All definitions/assignments of mono_clock_service (e.g. any init function): To determine whether the if-condition can be true at runtime, you need every site that sets or clears mono_clock_service (initialization, runtime updates, teardown). This reveals whether the deallocation path can be exercised. \n\n- Callers of MHD_fini (program/library shutdown/user code): Even if MHD_fini exists in the codebase, you must find any runtime paths that call it (application shutdown hooks, exported API users). If there are no callers in the deployed system, the finish function is effectively dead.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions allows the next analyzer to determine reachability, runtime conditions that enable the if-block, and whether the calls inside produce observable effects \u2014 all necessary to judge whether the function is dead code under the MISRA rule."
