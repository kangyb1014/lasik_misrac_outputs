  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. In the provided code the function MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish is always defined but its body is empty whenever HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME is not defined (the only code in the body is inside an #ifdef). In that configuration the call in MHD_fini() executes but has no observable effect; removing the call would not change program behaviour (aside from potential timing differences). That meets the rule\u2019s definition of dead code. The second scenario given (mono_clock_service always _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV at shutdown so the call never does anything) is also a valid example of dead code. (If there were observable side effects or timing constraints known to affect behaviour, the call might not be dead, but no such effects are shown here.)"
