  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Whether the call to MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish() is \"dead\" depends on observable behaviour of the program, and that includes timing (see Note 1). Even when HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME is not defined and the function body is empty, the call is still an executed operation (stack frame, call/return timing) and its removal could, in principle, change program behaviour. Moreover, the unconditional call preserves a stable API/termination sequence across builds/ports, which is a legitimate design choice. Therefore the mere presence of an empty function body in one configuration is not a definite MISRA 2.2 violation. If you want to be conservative or remove any ambiguity for static analysis, you can either #ifdef the call at the call site or provide a macro/inline no-op only when HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME is defined, but the agent A claim as stated is not a definite rule violation."
