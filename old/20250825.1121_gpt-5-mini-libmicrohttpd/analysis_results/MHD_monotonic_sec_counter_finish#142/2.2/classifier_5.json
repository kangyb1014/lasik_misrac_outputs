  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME\n  if (_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV != mono_clock_service)\n  {\n    mach_port_deallocate (mach_task_self (),\n                          mono_clock_service);\n    mono_clock_service = _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV;\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish:\nvoid\nMHD_fini (void)\n{\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  gnutls_global_deinit ();\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  WSACleanup ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n  MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish ();\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV != mono_clock_service)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if-condition is a runtime guard that prevents deallocating an invalid or already-deallocated mach port and updates mono_clock_service; its execution depends on program state. Removing the check or its body would change program behaviour (risking double/free of an invalid port), so this is not dead code."
