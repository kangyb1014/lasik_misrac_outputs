  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME\n  if (_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV != mono_clock_service)\n  {\n    mach_port_deallocate (mach_task_self (),\n                          mono_clock_service);\n    mono_clock_service = _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV;\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish:\nvoid\nMHD_fini (void)\n{\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  gnutls_global_deinit ();\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  WSACleanup ();\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n  MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish ();\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nMHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish ();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The call MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish() is a violation when compiled without HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME: the function body is empty (no side effects), so executing the call has no effect and its removal would not change program behaviour (aside from trivial timing). Therefore the call constitutes dead code. To fix, guard the call with the same macro or remove it when HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME is not defined."
