  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code only employs standard C constructs: a function definition, preprocessor conditional (#ifdef / #endif), an if statement, standard function calls, and an assignment. The identifiers and functions that look platform-specific (mach_port_deallocate, mach_task_self, and the _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV macro) are OS/API-specific symbols, not compiler language extensions; their use should be evaluated under portability or identifier-reservation rules but they are not language extensions as required by MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2. There are no uses of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions, nonstandard linkage specifications, or other documented compiler extension keywords or constructs. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that require investigation for Rule 1.2."
