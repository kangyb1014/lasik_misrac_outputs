  "explanation": "mono_clock_service: the global object being assigned to in the function; its declaration (storage class/type) is needed to confirm it is not a function parameter and to see its type (e.g. mach_port_t) so we can determine whether the assignment modifies a parameter or a global.\n\n_MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV: the constant/macro compared against and assigned to mono_clock_service; its definition clarifies the type/value used in the assignment and whether that write changes a parameter-like entity.\n\nmach_port_deallocate: the function called with mono_clock_service/mono_clock_service-related values; its prototype and semantics help ensure no pointer parameter of the analysed function is being modified indirectly and to understand side effects on arguments (but primarily to show the call does not modify any parameter of MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish since it has none).\n\nmach_task_self: the function or macro used to obtain the first argument to mach_port_deallocate; its declaration is needed to know its return type and whether any parameter of the target function could be affected.\n\nmach_port_t: the type used for mono_clock_service and the mach_* APIs; having the type definition ensures mono_clock_service is not a function parameter (it is a global of this type) and that the assignment targets a global object, not a parameter.\n\nHAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME: the compile-time macro controlling the presence of the code; needed to determine whether the code that writes mono_clock_service is actually present in the build being analyzed (if undefined the function body is empty and cannot violate the parameter-rule).\n\nOverall: these symbols let an analyst confirm that MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish takes no parameters and only writes a global, so the MISRA rule about modifying function parameters cannot be violated by this function as written."
