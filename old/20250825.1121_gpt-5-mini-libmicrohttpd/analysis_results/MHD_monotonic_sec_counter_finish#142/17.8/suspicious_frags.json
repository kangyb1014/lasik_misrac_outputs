  "explanation": "The function MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish has no formal parameters, so Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated in this function. The only assignment in the routine is to the identifier mono_clock_service, which is a global object (not a parameter) and therefore not subject to this rule. The conditional compilation and the call to mach_port_deallocate pass arguments to another function but do not modify any parameter of MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish itself. Consequently there are no fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
