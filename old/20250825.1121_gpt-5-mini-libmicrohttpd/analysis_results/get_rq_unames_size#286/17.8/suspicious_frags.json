  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function does not modify either of its parameters: 'uname_type' is used only in comparisons and never assigned to, and 'params' is a pointer to const (const struct MHD_RqDAuth *), so the code only reads fields via params (no writes to the object) and does not reassign the pointer itself. All arithmetic operations target the local variable 's'. The mhd_assert call only reads parameters. Therefore there is no code that violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
