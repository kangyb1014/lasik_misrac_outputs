  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The fragments above are the only controlling expressions in the function (an assertion condition and the if/else-if conditions) and therefore should be inspected for invariance. Other parts of the function do not contain control statements and so are not relevant to Rule 14.3: variable declaration/initialization (size_t s; s = 0;), arithmetic and assignment operations that compute s, the final return statement, and the macro definition for MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN (which is a compile-time constant used in an arithmetic expression rather than a controlling expression). These non-controlling fragments do not need investigation under Rule 14.3."
