  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for the MISRA-C 'dead code' analysis of get_rq_unames_size:\n\n- mhd_assert: The function calls mhd_assert(get_rq_uname_type(params) == uname_type). Typical assert macros may evaluate their argument only in debug builds and become a no-op in release builds. To decide whether the assertion (and the contained call to get_rq_uname_type) is actually executed (and thus whether its removal would change observable behaviour) you must know the exact definition/expansion of mhd_assert used in this project.\n\n- get_rq_uname_type: The assertion calls this function and the code relies on its result. You need its definition to determine (a) whether it has side effects (reading state, modifying globals, I/O, volatile accesses) which would make removing the call a behaviour change, and (b) what return values it can produce relative to uname_type so you can judge reachability/redundancy of the following branches.\n\n- enum MHD_DigestAuthUsernameType and the three enumerators (MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_STANDARD, MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_USERHASH, MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_UNAME_TYPE_EXTENDED): The branch conditions compare uname_type to these constants. You must know their exact definitions/values to detect degenerate cases (e.g. overlapping numeric values or ranges) that could make some branches always true/false or otherwise redundant. That affects whether code is unreachable vs. executed but semantically a no-op (dead).\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuth: The function reads params->username and params->username_ext. You need the struct definition (including any qualifiers such as volatile, atomic types, or accessor macros) to determine whether those reads have observable side effects. If reads are from volatile or have accessor semantics, removing them could change behaviour (so they are not dead).\n\n- username.value.len and username_ext.value.len fields: The arithmetic that produces the returned size depends on these len fields. You must know their type (signed/unsigned width), possible ranges, and whether reading them is side-effect-free. This is required to determine whether the arithmetic has any effect (e.g. always zero) and whether removing it would change behavior.\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN: The code subtracts this constant when uname_type is EXTENDED. Its numeric value can make the subtraction a no-op, always-positive, negative (underflow in unsigned), or otherwise change the result. Knowing its value is necessary to decide whether the EXTENDED branch performs any observable computation or could be removed without changing behaviour.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any of the executed operations in get_rq_unames_size are actually dead (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) you must know (1) whether the assertion and its nested call are actually evaluated or optimized away, (2) whether get_rq_uname_type and the len field reads have side effects, and (3) the concrete enum/constant values that determine branch outcomes and arithmetic results. These are exactly the symbols listed above."
