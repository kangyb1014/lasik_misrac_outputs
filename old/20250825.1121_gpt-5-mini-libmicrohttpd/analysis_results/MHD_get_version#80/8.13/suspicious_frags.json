  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function MHD_get_version already returns a pointer to a const-qualified type (const char *). All return paths yield values compatible with const char *: PACKAGE_VERSION and the literal \"0.0.0\" are string literals (decaying to pointers compatible with const char *), and the static buffer ver (char ver[12]) is returned through a const-qualified pointer \u2014 this is acceptable because ver must remain mutable (it is written via MHD_snprintf_) so it cannot be declared const. There are no other pointer declarations in the provided snippets that point to non-const data where a const qualification could be applied. Therefore no fragments violate or need investigation under Rule 8.13."
