  "explanation": "PACKAGE_VERSION: needed to know what PACKAGE_VERSION expands to (string literal, char array, char * from elsewhere, etc.). If PACKAGE_VERSION is a mutable object (non-const char[] or pointer to non-const) returning it as const char * may hide a mismatch; if it is a string literal or a const-qualified object, returning const char * is appropriate. MHD_snprintf_: its prototype (parameter types/const qualifiers and whether it writes into the buffer) is required to determine whether the local static ver buffer must be non-const (i.e. MHD_snprintf_ will take a char * and modify it). If the routine writes into ver, ver cannot be declared const even though the function returns const char *. _MHD_EXTERN: macro expansion can affect the function declaration/qualifiers (linkage/annotations) and potentially the effective type seen by callers; confirm it does not alter or contradict the const qualification of the return type. print_version: the caller implementation is required to see how the returned const char * is used; if callers attempt to modify the pointed-to data (cast away const and write) that would indicate a violation of the rule in the wider program even if this function returns const char *. MHD_VERSION: its definition/type (how version bytes are produced) is not directly about constness but useful to confirm that ver is actually written at runtime (i.e. the function populates ver before returning) and to understand whether ver could be made const in some builds; it also helps assess whether PACKAGE_VERSION might be synthesized from MHD_VERSION in headers. These symbols together let an analyzer decide whether returned pointers actually point to const-qualified storage whenever possible and whether any returned non-const storage is necessary because it is modified in this function or by callers."
