  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_get_version uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect all externally-defined macros/types/functions it relies on: \n\n- _MHD_EXTERN (macro): This macro controls the function's linkage/decoration. It may expand to compiler-specific extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, extern \"C\" linkage specifiers). You must see its expansion to decide if a language extension is used. \n\n- PACKAGE_VERSION (macro): The code path is conditional on PACKAGE_VERSION. If defined it is returned directly; the macro could itself be produced by build/config machinery or contain extension tokens. Its definition is needed to know which code is compiled and whether that definition uses extensions. \n\n- MHD_snprintf_ (function or macro and its declaration/definition): The body calls MHD_snprintf_. That symbol may be a wrapper macro/function that uses non\u2011standard signatures, attributes, varargs handling, or maps to platform-specific functions (e.g. _snprintf) \u2014 any of which could be a language/compiler extension. You need its prototype/definition to check for extensions. \n\n- MHD_VERSION (macro or constant): The macro is used in bit shifts and casts. Its definition might use compiler-specific constants, suffixes, or constructs (e.g. 64-bit literal suffixes, nonstandard macros), so you must inspect it to be sure no extension is used.\n\n- uint32_t (typedef / type definition): The code casts to uint32_t. The origin and definition of uint32_t must be known (standard <stdint.h> vs. an implementation-provided or nonstandard typedef) to ensure no language extension is required to use it.\n\n(Other local tokens like ver, res, sizeof, casts and format strings are standard C and need no further symbols. The callers in the static call graph are not required to decide whether the target uses language extensions.)"
