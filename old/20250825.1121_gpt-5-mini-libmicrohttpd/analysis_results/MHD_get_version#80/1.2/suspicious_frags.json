  "explanation": "No other code constructs in the snippet appear to be compiler-specific language extensions. The conditional compilation using PACKAGE_VERSION, the static array initialization, casts to uint32_t and int, bit shifts and masks, use of standard integer types (uint32_t), string literals, and the return statements are all standard C constructs. The macros/identifiers PACKAGE_VERSION and MHD_VERSION are ordinary preprocessor macros from build/config context, not language extensions by themselves. Therefore only the two fragments above require investigation as they are the only places that may expand to or invoke compiler-specific extensions (storage-class/visibility macro and a nonstandard snprintf wrapper)."
