  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not invoke the Standard Library string-handling functions that can write into caller-provided buffers. Specifically:\n- The preprocessor branch that returns PACKAGE_VERSION (return PACKAGE_VERSION;) simply returns a pointer to a string literal \u2014 no string.h operations or buffer writes occur there.\n- The integer macro MHD_VERSION and the bit-shift/cast expressions are purely integer computations and do not perform any string memory accesses.\n- The final \"return ver;\" statement merely returns a pointer to the static buffer; any potential out-of-bounds writes into that buffer would originate from the snprintf call(s) which are included above in the suspicious fragments.\n- There are no uses of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn in the provided code.\n\nI have therefore limited suspicious fragments to the static buffer definition and the code that formats/writes into that buffer (the snprintf call and its return-value check) for further investigation under Rule 21.17."
