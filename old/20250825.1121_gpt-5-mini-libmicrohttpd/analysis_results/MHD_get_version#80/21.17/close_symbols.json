  "explanation": "- MHD_snprintf_: This call writes into the local buffer 'ver'. To determine if any write can run past ver's bounds we must know the exact prototype and semantics of MHD_snprintf_ (return value semantics, whether it guarantees NUL-termination when size>0, and the maximum number of bytes it will write). If MHD_snprintf_ behaves like C99 snprintf the current checks may be sufficient; if it has different semantics (e.g. returns negative on truncation or does not NUL-terminate) the code may violate bounds/termination safety.\n\n- snprintf/vsnprintf (the C library functions MHD_snprintf_ may wrap): If MHD_snprintf_ is a thin wrapper around snprintf/vsnprintf, we need the standard behaviour (how many characters are written vs. reported, truncation rules and NUL-termination guarantees) to judge correctness under MISRA's bounds rule.\n\n- MHD_VERSION: The code extracts three bytes from this macro/constant and formats them as hex. Knowing its type and value (or at least that shifts/masks yield 0..255) confirms the maximum width of each %x field (at most two hex digits) so we can compute the worst-case formatted length and check it against sizeof(ver).\n\n- PACKAGE_VERSION: When defined the function returns PACKAGE_VERSION directly (no formatting). To conclude there is no string.h bounds violation in that path we need to know what PACKAGE_VERSION expands to (e.g. a string literal or pointer) and that returning it does not involve any bounded-copy/string.h call elsewhere.\n\n- uint32_t typedef (e.g. from <stdint.h>): To ensure the shifts and masks performed on MHD_VERSION produce the expected 8-bit values and to reason about integer promotions/implementation-defined behaviour that could affect the formatted output length.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine the maximum possible number of bytes written into 'ver', whether NUL-termination is guaranteed, and whether any string-handling operations could access beyond object bounds (the essence of the cited MISRA rule)."
