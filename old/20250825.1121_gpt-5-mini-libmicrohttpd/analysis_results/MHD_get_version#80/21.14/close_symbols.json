  "explanation": "MHD_snprintf_: MHD_get_version calls this function to format the version into the local buffer; the implementation could (a) fail to NUL-terminate the buffer or (b) internally call memcmp on NUL-terminated strings. Its definition is required to determine whether any memcmp use (or missing NUL termination) originates here.\n\nPACKAGE_VERSION: If PACKAGE_VERSION is defined the function returns that macro directly (no local formatting). The macro's definition (likely a string literal or expression) must be inspected to ensure it does not involve memcmp on NUL-terminated strings and to confirm whether the returned object is a NUL-terminated string.\n\nMHD_VERSION: The numeric macro/constant used to build the dotted-version string affects which branch of the function runs (and the formatting). Its type/definition is needed to confirm the formatting behavior does not introduce any memcmp use or non-NUL-terminated results.\n\nprint_version: A direct caller of MHD_get_version (per the call graph). Although a violation of the memcmp-on-C-string rule in that caller would not be strictly inside MHD_get_version, the caller may compare the returned string with memcmp; including the caller allows the analyst to see whether misuse of memcmp happens immediately after MHD_get_version returns (relevant to overall usage of the returned string).\n\ncheck_apply_params: Caller of print_version (in call graph). Including this symbol lets the analyst follow callers upward to find any memcmp usage that operates on MHD_get_version's return value (so that the analysis can distinguish violations inside MHD_get_version from violations in its callers).\n\nmemcmp: The actual standard-library function named in the MISRA rule. Include its symbol/uses in the translation unit(s) so the analyst can locate any memcmp invocations and verify whether they are being used to compare NUL-terminated strings (and thus would violate the rule)."
