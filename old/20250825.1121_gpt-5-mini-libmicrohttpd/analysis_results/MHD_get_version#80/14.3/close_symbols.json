  "explanation": "PACKAGE_VERSION: The whole #else branch (which contains the controlling expression if (0 == ver[0])) is compiled only when PACKAGE_VERSION is not defined. Whether PACKAGE_VERSION is defined determines which code is present and thus whether the potentially invariant controlling expression exists at all.\\n\\nMHD_snprintf_: The if test depends on whether ver[0] remains zero after the first call. That in turn depends on whether MHD_snprintf_ actually writes a non-zero first byte into ver and on its return semantics (value on success, negative on error, semantics on truncation). You must know its prototype/implementation (whether it behaves like snprintf, whether it modifies ver on failure/truncation) to decide if the controlling expression can change between calls (non\u2011invariant) or remains invariant.\\n\\nMHD_VERSION: The formatted string is built from three bytes extracted from MHD_VERSION. Knowing the value or at least the range/meaning of MHD_VERSION lets you determine the expected length/content of the formatted result (e.g. each component is masked to 0..255 so each %x is at most two hex digits). That feeds into whether the formatted text will fit into ver (thus whether MHD_snprintf_ will succeed and change ver[0]).\\n\\nuint32_t: The code casts MHD_VERSION to uint32_t and shifts/masks. You need the width/semantics of uint32_t to be sure each extracted component is in 0..255 (so the format output length bounds are correct). This affects whether MHD_snprintf_ can succeed and therefore whether ver[0] becomes non-zero (making the controlling expression non\u2011invariant)."
