  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function MHD_get_version and the related code fragments. There are no for statements in MHD_get_version, in print_version, or in the provided macro definitions (PACKAGE_VERSION, MHD_snprintf_, MHD_VERSION). Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (requirements on for loops) is not applicable to any of the supplied code. No other constructs in the shown code resemble for-loop clauses or macro expansions that introduce a for loop, so there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 14.2. If you want analysis across additional source files or the implementation of external functions/macros (e.g. the runtime snprintf implementation), please provide those sources because a for loop inside called or included code would be outside the scope of the fragments shown here."
