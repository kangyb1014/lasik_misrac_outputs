  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not present obvious candidates for dead code given the provided snippets. In particular:\n- The active #ifdef branch (return PACKAGE_VERSION;) is compiled in this configuration because PACKAGE_VERSION is defined, and MHD_get_version is actually called from print_version, which itself is invoked from check_apply_params when the version option is requested, so the function (the compiled branch) is reachable and used.\n- Macros and symbols shown (PACKAGE_VERSION, MHD_snprintf_, MHD_VERSION) are defined and used; there are no obvious unused static functions or variables in the supplied excerpts.\n- The conditional checks in check_apply_params and print_version are runtime conditions (not compile-time unreachable) and therefore are not dead code per MISRA Rule 2.2; they may legitimately execute depending on runtime state.\nGiven that PACKAGE_VERSION is defined in the provided definitions, the #else block inside MHD_get_version is the only fragment that should be investigated for potential dead-code issues (it may never be compiled/used in the current build configuration). No other fragments in the supplied code appear to meet the MISRA 2.2 definition of dead code."
