Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide whether the function contains dead code:\n\n- PACKAGE_VERSION\n  - Controls the preprocessor branch selection. If PACKAGE_VERSION is defined the entire runtime logic (static ver, snprintf call, conditional) is compiled out. To decide whether any of the runtime operations are dead you must know whether PACKAGE_VERSION is defined in the build.\n\n- MHD_snprintf_\n  - The runtime branch performs a call to MHD_snprintf_. You must know its semantics (return values on success/error, side effects on the buffer, whether it can be a no-op) to determine whether the call and the enclosing if-block perform visible work. Dead-code analysis requires knowing whether removing the call would change observable behaviour (written contents of ver, error path that returns \"0.0.0\").\n\n- MHD_VERSION\n  - The arguments passed to MHD_snprintf_ are derived from MHD_VERSION. Its value affects the formatted output and may influence whether the formatted text fits into ver and whether the error return path is taken. To judge if the snprintf call (and the conditional that guards it) is necessary or redundant you must know MHD_VERSION.\n\n- print_version\n  - This is the direct caller of MHD_get_version according to the call graph. To decide if the call inside MHD_get_version (and any writes it performs) is required for program behaviour you must inspect the caller: how it uses the returned string (e.g. prints it, ignores it, or uses it only for diagnostics). If the caller ignores the result or its observable behaviour does not depend on the result, the call may be dead.\n\n- check_apply_params\n  - Identified as the caller of print_version in the call graph. Dead-code determination must follow the full call chain to final observable effects. Knowing what check_apply_params does (and whether print_version ultimately affects program behaviour) is necessary to decide whether removal of MHD_get_version\u2019s runtime operations changes observable behaviour.\n\n(Other symbols such as types like uint32_t or the local static ver buffer are local to the function and visible in the target source; they do not need to be listed as additional external symbols for the dead-code determination.)"
