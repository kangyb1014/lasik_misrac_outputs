  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_version:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_get_version (void)\n{\n#ifdef PACKAGE_VERSION\n  return PACKAGE_VERSION;\n#else  /* !PACKAGE_VERSION */\n  static char ver[12] = \"\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\";\n  if (0 == ver[0])\n  {\n    int res = MHD_snprintf_ (ver,\n                             sizeof(ver),\n                             \"%x.%x.%x\",\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 24) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 16) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 8) & 0xFF));\n    if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof(ver) <= res))\n      return \"0.0.0\"; /* Can't return real version */\n  }\n  return ver;\n#endif /* !PACKAGE_VERSION */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_get_version:\n#define PACKAGE_VERSION \"1.0.1\"\n...\n#define MHD_snprintf_ snprintf\n...\n#define MHD_VERSION 0x01000100\n...\nstatic void\nprint_version (void)\n{\n  printf (\"%s (GNU libmicrohttpd\", self_name);\n  if (0 != build_revision[0])\n    printf (\"; %s\", build_revision);\n  printf (\") %s\\n\", MHD_get_version ());\n  printf (\"%s\\n\", tool_copyright);\n}\n...\nstatic int\ncheck_apply_params (void)\n{\n  if (tool_params.help)\n  {\n    show_help ();\n    return -1;\n  }\n  else if (tool_params.version)\n  {\n    print_version ();\n    return -1;\n  }\n  check_param_port ();\n  check_apply_param__all_cpus ();\n  check_apply_param__threads ();\n  if (! check_apply_param__thread_per_conn ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  if (! check_param__epoll ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  if (! check_param__poll ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  check_param__empty_tiny_medium_large ();\n  check_param__shared_single_unique ();\n  if (! check_param__connections ())\n    return PERF_RPL_ERR_CODE_BAD_PARAM;\n  return 0;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#else  /* !PACKAGE_VERSION */\n  static char ver[12] = \"\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\";\n  if (0 == ver[0])\n  {\n    int res = MHD_snprintf_ (ver,\n                             sizeof(ver),\n                             \"%x.%x.%x\",\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 24) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 16) & 0xFF),\n                             (int) (((uint32_t) MHD_VERSION >> 8) & 0xFF));\n    if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof(ver) <= res))\n      return \"0.0.0\"; /* Can't return real version */\n  }\n  return ver;\n#endif /* !PACKAGE_VERSION */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. In this project PACKAGE_VERSION is defined (#define PACKAGE_VERSION \"1.0.1\"), so the #else branch shown is not compiled into the program and therefore cannot be executed. MISRA\u2011C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour; code that is never compiled/executed does not meet that definition. Thus the fragment does not violate Rule 2.2. (If PACKAGE_VERSION were undefined and both branches or parts of code were compiled but an executed operation was redundant, that could be a different matter.)"
