  "explanation": "The function MHD_get_version has no parameters (signature: MHD_get_version(void)), so Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated within this function. The code does modify a local static array (ver) and calls MHD_snprintf_ with ver as an argument, but those are not modifications of this function's parameters. Returning string literals or the address of the static buffer also does not involve modifying any function parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
