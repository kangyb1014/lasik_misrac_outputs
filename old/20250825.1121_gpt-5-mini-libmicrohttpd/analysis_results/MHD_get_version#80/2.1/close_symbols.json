  "explanation": "To decide whether any part of MHD_get_version is unreachable in the project you must know: \n\n- PACKAGE_VERSION: this preprocessor macro controls whether the entire #else branch (the function body shown) is compiled at all. If PACKAGE_VERSION is defined the shown code is not present (so not reachable) \u2014 you must know its definition point/value in build configuration.\n\n- MHD_snprintf_: the behavior and return semantics of this function determine whether subsequent code paths (the if checking res and the return \"0.0.0\" fallback) can ever be executed. Its prototype/implementation is needed to reason about possible return values and side effects.\n\n- MHD_VERSION: the value/type of this macro/constant is used to compute the version string; knowing whether it is defined/meaningful affects whether the code is intended to run and whether any branches are effectively dead.\n\n- print_version: this direct caller of MHD_get_version is required to assess reachability of MHD_get_version from within the module. You need its body/usages to see whether it calls MHD_get_version unconditionally or only under conditions that are never true.\n\n- check_apply_params: this is the next caller up the static call chain. You must examine it to determine whether print_version (and thus MHD_get_version) is ever invoked in normal execution.\n\n- main (or other program/library entry points that could call check_apply_params): to conclude whether MHD_get_version (via print_version and check_apply_params) is reachable from program execution you must know whether any program entry point or exported API actually leads to check_apply_params. Without the program roots you cannot decide global reachability.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine (a) whether the code is compiled into the build and (b) whether any control flow from program entry can invoke it \u2014 the two necessary checks to decide if code is unreachable under the MISRA rule."
