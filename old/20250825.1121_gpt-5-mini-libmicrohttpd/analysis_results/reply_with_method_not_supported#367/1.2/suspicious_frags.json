  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the supplied code. The code uses only standard C constructs: enums, pointers, static/const storage, size_t, sizeof, standard function calls, a cast-to-void to ignore a return value, and string literals (with a standard preprocessor line continuation and/or adjacent literal concatenation). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*/__typeof__, statement expressions ({ ... }), zero-length arrays, or other vendor-specific keywords or builtins. Library-specific identifiers (MHD_*) are API calls/macros and do not imply language extensions. Therefore no fragments require further investigation for Rule 1.2."
