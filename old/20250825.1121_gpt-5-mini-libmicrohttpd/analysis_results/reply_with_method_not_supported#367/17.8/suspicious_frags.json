  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function has a single parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *c' which is never assigned to or otherwise modified in this function (there is no statement like 'c = ...' or pointer arithmetic on 'c'). The pointer is only passed to library functions (e.g. MHD_queue_response), and modification of the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule. All local objects (resp, ret, page_content, page_content_len) are local variables and may be modified. The (void) cast on MHD_add_response_header only discards the return value and does not modify the function parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
