  "explanation": "To determine whether SHA1Result violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer needs the following facts:\n\n- struct SHA1Context (fields): The function reads/writes intermediate_hash, message_block and flags (computed, corrupted) and sets length_low/length_high. Knowing the exact types and semantics (e.g. whether intermediate_hash is an array of 32-bit words or a char buffer, whether message_block is text or binary) is essential to decide if data produced/consumed by SHA1Result can be considered null-terminated strings (and therefore subject to the memcmp restriction).\n\n- SHA1HashSize: The length used to generate Message_Digest determines whether the buffer is intended as a binary digest (fixed-length, possibly containing zeros) or a NUL-terminated string; this affects whether any memcmp usage on such buffers would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage and SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: These callees manipulate the message and digest buffers. Their implementations can produce or depend on NUL-terminated strings or may call memcmp themselves. Inspecting them is necessary to see whether any memcmp use is present or whether the data become text (NUL-terminated) at any point.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT values: Knowing the possible return codes is needed to understand control-flow and whether callers treat the output as strings (e.g. only in success path) which could influence whether a subsequent memcmp would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n- Message_Digest parameter (type/size as seen by callers): How callers pass and use Message_Digest (as a binary digest buffer vs. a C string) is important \u2014 memcmp misuse would only be a MISRA violation if memcmp is used to compare buffers that are actually NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value and its callees (SHA1Reset, SHA1Input, BASE64Encode): ws_get_accept_value is a known caller of SHA1Result (per the call graph). To determine whether SHA1Result leads to any memcmp-on-strings misuse, inspect its callers and their callees to find any memcmp calls that compare values produced by SHA1Result (e.g. comparing digests or stringified digests). In particular, BASE64Encode or surrounding code may convert the digest to a string that later gets compared with memcmp.\n\n- memcmp (declaration and any uses in the translation unit): Finally, the analyzer must locate every use of memcmp (including wrappers) in the relevant translation unit(s) to see whether any call uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings produced by or passed through SHA1Result or its callers/callees.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next agent decide whether any memcmp uses related to SHA1Result operate on NUL-terminated strings (MISRA violation) or on binary fixed-length buffers (allowed)."
