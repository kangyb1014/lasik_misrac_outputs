  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other string comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) are present in the provided code. The code operates on fixed-size byte arrays and integer fields (e.g. Message_Digest[SHA1HashSize], context->message_block[64], context->intermediate_hash) and uses numeric indexing and bit shifts rather than string comparisons. There are no null-terminated string variables or any calls that compare C strings, so Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) is not applicable to any fragment in this function. Therefore no fragments need investigation for this rule."
