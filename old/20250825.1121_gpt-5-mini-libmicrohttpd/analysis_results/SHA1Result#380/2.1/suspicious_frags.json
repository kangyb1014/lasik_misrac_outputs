  "explanation": "I selected the four conditional/loop fragments above because they are the places where execution may or may not reach depending on the state of the inputs and the context structure; each could therefore be a candidate for unreachable (dead) code in some build/runtime scenarios and should be investigated. Other parts of the function do not present plausible unreachable-code issues: the local declaration (int i;) is required; there are no statements placed after unconditional returns within the same block (no obvious syntactic dead code); and the final return (return SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS;) is the natural exit if earlier returns are not taken. There are no trailing statements after unconditional returns, no duplicate identical conditional branches, and no obviously constant-false conditions in the remaining code that would indicate further unreachable fragments."
