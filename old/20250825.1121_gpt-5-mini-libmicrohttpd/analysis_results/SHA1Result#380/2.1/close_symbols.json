  "explanation": "Each symbol is required to decide whether any branch or statement in SHA1Result is unreachable in the whole program.\n\n- struct SHA1Context: SHA1Result reads and writes several context fields (corrupted, computed, message_block[], length_low/high, intermediate_hash[]). You must know their types, sizes and any invariants (e.g. array bounds) and whether some fields are never writable/readable elsewhere; this affects whether branches (e.g. context->corrupted true/false) or loops (indexing intermediate_hash) are actually reachable.\n\n- SHA1HashSize: the for-loops iterate to SHA1HashSize; if this constant is zero or has an unexpected value the loops (and code within) may be unreachable or out-of-bounds. You need its definition to judge reachability of the loops.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT and its enumerators: to understand the meaning of each return and to check whether some return paths are impossible given how callers use/expect the function.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage: SHA1Result calls SHA1PadMessage when context->computed is false. If SHA1PadMessage never returns (e.g. longjmp, exit) or always sets particular context fields (computed/corrupted), then the statements immediately after the call in SHA1Result may be unreachable. You need the implementation to decide that.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: SHA1PadMessage calls this function; if that function contains non-local control flow (abort/longjmp) or alters context in a way that makes subsequent code unreachable, it must be considered when determining reachability of code in SHA1Result.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value (caller): whether the initial NULL-pointer checks in SHA1Result (context or Message_Digest NULL) or the corrupted/computed branches are ever taken depends on how SHA1Result is invoked. You must inspect the caller to see whether it can pass NULL or a context with particular field values; if callers never pass NULL or always set computed, some branches become unreachable.\n\n- SHA1Reset and SHA1Input: these are called by ws_get_accept_value before SHA1Result. They may initialize the SHA1Context (for example setting computed or corrupted), or allocate/prepare the Message_Digest buffer; their behavior directly affects which branches inside SHA1Result are reachable when invoked from ws_get_accept_value.\n\n- Call-site details in ws_get_accept_value that build/pass Message_Digest: to decide if the Message_Digest NULL-check is ever taken you need to know whether the buffer is always a valid pointer (stack/local/static), possibly NULL, or conditionally omitted.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine for each conditional and loop in SHA1Result whether there exists any program path that reaches it. Without them you cannot conclude whether code in SHA1Result is unreachable in the project."
