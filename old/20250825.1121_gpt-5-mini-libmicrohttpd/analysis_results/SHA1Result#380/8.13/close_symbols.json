  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA C 'pointer should point to const whenever possible' analysis:\n\n- struct SHA1Context (complete definition): The function reads and writes fields of *context* (corrupted, computed, message_block[], length_low, length_high, intermediate_hash[]). To decide whether the context pointer could be const we must see the concrete members and their types to determine which members are modified (so const would be forbidden) and whether any members could be const-qualified instead.\n\n- SHA1HashSize (macro / constant): The parameter Message_Digest is declared as unsigned char Message_Digest[SHA1HashSize]. Knowing the exact size is needed to determine whether Message_Digest is an input-only buffer (would allow const) or an output buffer written by SHA1Result, and to inspect any size-related aliasing/overlap concerns that affect const-qualification.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage (prototype): SHA1Result calls SHA1PadMessage(context). To decide if context could be const, you must know SHA1PadMessage's signature and whether it modifies the context (transitively making const impossible). The prototype also shows if the function expects non-const pointer types.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (prototype): SHA1PadMessage calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock per the call graph. Because modifications may occur in that callee (transitively via SHA1PadMessage), its prototype is required to determine whether context is modified deeper in the call chain and therefore cannot be const.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value (caller function and its call site to SHA1Result): To determine whether Message_Digest or context could be declared const 'whenever possible' you must inspect call sites: what objects are passed (are they const-qualified at the call site?) and whether callers expect those buffers to be modified later. The caller may pass temporaries or const objects that would reveal a violation if SHA1Result writes through a pointer declared non-const, or conversely may show that parameters are always mutable so const is not possible.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT (definition): While not directly about pointer const-qualification, the return type and its values complete the function signature and may be needed for a full static analysis of the API usage and whether callers treat the function as an inspector (const-friendly) or mutator. Including it ensures completeness of the function-level analysis.\n\nThese symbols let the next analyst determine whether the parameters (context and Message_Digest) are modified inside the target or in callees or expected to be immutable by callers \u2014 the information required to judge whether they should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
