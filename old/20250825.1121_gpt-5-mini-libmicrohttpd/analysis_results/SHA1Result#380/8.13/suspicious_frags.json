  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. The function has two pointer parameters: (1) 'struct SHA1Context *context' and (2) 'unsigned char Message_Digest[SHA1HashSize]' (decays to 'unsigned char *'). Both pointers are written to in this function: context is modified (calls SHA1PadMessage(context); zeroes message_block; resets length_low/length_high; sets computed), and Message_Digest[] is assigned to (Message_Digest[i] = ...). Because both pointed-to objects are intentionally modified, they cannot be qualified as pointer-to-const and thus do not violate Rule 8.13. No other pointer targets appear in this fragment that could reasonably be const-qualified."
