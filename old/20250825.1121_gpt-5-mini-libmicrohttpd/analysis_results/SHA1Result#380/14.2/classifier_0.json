  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1Result:\n```c\nstatic enum SHA1_RESULT\nSHA1Result (struct SHA1Context *context, unsigned char\n            Message_Digest[SHA1HashSize])\n{\n  int i;\n\n  if (! context || !

  "scenario": "The for loop 'for (i = 0; i < 64; ++i) { context->message_block[i] = 0; }' initializes the single loop counter i in the first clause, uses only i in the second clause (no persistent side effects and no use of objects modified in the loop body), and the third clause modifies only i. The loop body does not modify i. Therefore it complies with the requirements of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
