The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) SHA1HashSize\n   - The second for-loop uses SHA1HashSize in its loop bound (i < SHA1HashSize). To check MISRA clause 2 (the second clause must not use objects that are modified in the loop body and must have no persistent side effects) we must know whether SHA1HashSize is a compile-time constant/macro or a modifiable object (variable) or a function-like macro. If it is a modifiable object, that would violate the rule; if it is a macro/constant the clause is satisfied. Therefore its definition is required.\n\n2) struct SHA1Context (full definition including members: message_block, intermediate_hash, computed, corrupted, length_low, length_high)\n   - Both for-loops index and/or write into members of this struct (context->message_block[...] and context->intermediate_hash[...]) and the function reads/writes computed/corrupted/length_* around the loops. To verify MISRA clauses 2\u20134 we must ensure:\n     - The loop counter (i) is the only loop control variable and is not modified indirectly by writes into struct members (i.e., ensure there is no aliasing or macro magic where writing message_block[i] or accessing intermediate_hash[...] could change i).\n     - None of the struct members used in loop bounds/expressions are themselves used in the second-clause expressions (they are not in the current code, but we must verify that e.g. SHA1HashSize is not implemented via a struct member) or are volatile/side-effecting objects that would give persistent side-effects in the loop condition.\n     - That the writes in the loop body do not modify any object that appears in the loop condition (ensuring compliance with clause 2), and that no function calls inside the loop body (none here) would modify the loop counter indirectly through pointers into the struct.\n\nThese symbols provide the necessary information to decide whether the for-statements are well-formed under the MISRA rule (i.e., that the loop bounds use only the loop counter/ harmless constants, that the only modified object in the third clause is the loop counter, and that the loop counter is not altered in the body or by called functions)."
