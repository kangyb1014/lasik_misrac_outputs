  "explanation": "This function contains no calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The only memory-clear operation is an explicit for-loop that sets context->message_block[i] = 0 for i from 0 to 63 (not a call to memset). Array accesses (the zeroing loop and the Message_Digest fill loop) are indexed with constants/expressions that are bounded by literal 64 and SHA1HashSize respectively, and the function checks for null pointers for context and Message_Digest before performing those accesses. Therefore there are no uses of string.h functions here that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17 and no fragments in this snippet require investigation for that rule."
