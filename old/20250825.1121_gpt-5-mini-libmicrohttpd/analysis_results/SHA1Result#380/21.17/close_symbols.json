  "explanation": "To determine whether SHA1Result (and the chain it invokes) can violate the MISRA rule about out-of-bounds accesses via string.h functions, the next analyst must be able to reason about buffer sizes, indexing, and any use of standard string functions in called code. Specifically:\n\n- struct SHA1Context: You must know the exact sizes of message_block and intermediate_hash and the types of corrupted/computed/length_* fields. The target function writes to context->message_block[0..63] and reads context->intermediate_hash[i>>2]; verifying these index operations are in-bounds requires the concrete array sizes and types from the struct definition.\n\n- SHA1HashSize: The loop bound for copying to Message_Digest is SHA1HashSize. Its numeric value determines how many bytes are read from intermediate_hash and written to Message_Digest; verifying both source and destination bounds needs this constant.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage: SHA1Result calls SHA1PadMessage when !computed. SHA1PadMessage may modify context->message_block, intermediate_hash, computed flag, or call string.h functions (e.g. memset/memcpy). You must inspect its implementation to confirm it does not call string.h functions with out-of-bounds pointers or leave context state such that SHA1Result later indexes out of range.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: SHA1PadMessage calls this; it may perform memory operations or manipulate intermediate_hash/message_block. Any use of memcpy/memset/etc must be inspected here to ensure no pointer parameters reference out-of-bounds objects.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value: This is the caller shown in the call graph; it constructs/passes the Message_Digest buffer to SHA1Result. To determine whether Message_Digest is a sufficiently sized object (so that the assignments Message_Digest[0..SHA1HashSize-1] are safe) you must see how ws_get_accept_value allocates or declares that buffer and whether its size equals or exceeds SHA1HashSize.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT: While not directly required for bounds, including the enum lets the analyzer fully model function behavior and control flow (e.g. early returns) to know whether the code paths that touch buffers are reachable.\n\nWith these symbols (definitions and implementations), the next analyst can (1) check whether any string.h functions are used in the called functions and whether their pointer parameters are within object bounds, and (2) confirm that all indexed accesses in SHA1Result (and the state it relies on) stay within allocated array bounds."
