  "explanation": "For MISRA dead-code analysis we must know whether each operation in SHA1Result actually affects program behaviour (or is redundant). Each listed symbol is required for that determination:\n\n- struct SHA1Context\n  - Needed to see the exact fields (types, sizes and layout) used in SHA1Result: corrupted, computed, message_block[], length_low, length_high, intermediate_hash[]. Knowing which fields are read/written elsewhere determines whether writes here are observable or dead.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage\n  - SHA1Result calls it. Its implementation determines whether subsequent clearing of message_block/length_* and setting computed in SHA1Result is redundant (i.e. whether SHA1PadMessage already does that) or whether it produces essential side-effects.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock\n  - SHA1PadMessage calls it. To evaluate whether SHA1PadMessage (and therefore SHA1Result) produces essential state changes, we need to know what ProcessMessageBlock does to the same context fields that SHA1Result later touches.\n\n- SHA1HashSize\n  - The loop bounds and number of bytes produced depend on this macro/constant (likely 20). Its value affects whether the digest-copy loop is meaningful and matches intermediate_hash layout; mismatches could make code dead or incorrect.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT (SHA1_RESULT_NULL, SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR, SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS)\n  - Needed to understand the semantic effect of return values and how callers respond to them; if callers ignore certain return values the branches returning them could be dead with respect to observable behaviour.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value\n  - The only listed caller of SHA1Result. We must inspect how ws_get_accept_value uses SHA1Result (does it check return code, rely on Message_Digest contents, call other SHA1 helpers before/after) to judge whether parts of SHA1Result are required.\n\n- ahc_cb\n  - The caller of ws_get_accept_value. To decide whether SHA1Result is ever invoked at runtime (reachability), and whether timing/ordering matter per MISRA Note 1, we need the call chain up to an entry point.\n\n- SHA1Reset and SHA1Input\n  - These are called by ws_get_accept_value and may modify the same SHA1Context fields (computed, message_block, length_* or intermediate_hash). Their behaviour can make operations inside SHA1Result redundant or necessary depending on ordering and state transitions.\n\n- BASE64Encode\n  - Included because ws_get_accept_value calls it after SHA1Result; how ws_get_accept_value combines SHA1Result output with BASE64Encode may determine whether the digest-copy loop in SHA1Result is ever observed; this affects whether that copy (or other writes) is dead.\n\nIn short: to decide whether any assignment/call/loop inside SHA1Result is dead (i.e. removable without changing program behaviour) we must examine the SHA1Context layout and every function that produces or consumes those fields, the exact constant sizes, and the call chain from external entry points to judge reachability and observable effects."
