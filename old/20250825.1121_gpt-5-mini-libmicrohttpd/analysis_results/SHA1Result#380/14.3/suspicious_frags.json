  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the function are invariant under Rule 14.3. Specific reasoning:\n- The if statements (if (!context || !Message_Digest), if (context->corrupted), if (!context->computed)) depend on pointer values or structure fields; their truth values can vary and are not invariant.\n- The for loops (for (i = 0; i < 64; ++i) and for (i = 0; i < SHA1HashSize; ++i)) use the loop variable i in the controlling expressions; i is modified by the loop, so the conditions are not invariant even though the upper bounds are compile-time constants (64 and SHA1HashSize). A constant bound does not make the controlling expression invariant when it depends on a changing variable.\n- There are no while or do-while loops with constant controlling expressions, and no explicit infinite-loop constructs relying on an invariant condition that would need the exception.\n\nAccordingly, there are no code fragments that require further investigation for Rule 14.3 in this function."
