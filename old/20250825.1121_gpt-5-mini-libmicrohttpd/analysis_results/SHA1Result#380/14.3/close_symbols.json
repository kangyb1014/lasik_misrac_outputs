  "explanation": "To determine whether any controlling expression in SHA1Result is an invariant (MISRA: 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant') we must know all sources and mutability of values used in the conditionals and loop bounds. Rationale for each symbol:\n\n- struct SHA1Context (definition): SHA1Result reads context->corrupted, context->computed, context->message_block[], context->length_low, context->length_high, and context->intermediate_hash[]. The field types, qualifiers (e.g. volatile) and sizes determine whether those members can change at runtime and whether the expressions using them could be constant/invariant.\n\n- SHA1HashSize: used in the second for-loop bound (i < SHA1HashSize). Knowing whether SHA1HashSize is a compile-time constant or can vary (macro vs variable) is essential to decide if the controlling expression is invariant or depends on a changing loop index.\n\n- enum SHA1_RESULT and enumerators (SHA1_RESULT_NULL, SHA1_RESULT_STATE_ERROR, SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS): needed for semantic understanding of the returned values and to check whether any return path makes a controlling expression redundant; not required to detect invariance directly but required for a complete correctness/semantics analysis.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage (implementation/prototype): called when !context->computed; its side effects (especially whether it sets context->computed, context->corrupted, updates intermediate_hash, message_block, lengths, or uses volatile state) are crucial to know whether the if (!context->computed) test is transient or invariant and whether subsequent code relies on changes made by the call.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (implementation/prototype): SHA1PadMessage calls this. To fully understand SHA1PadMessage side effects (which affect context fields used in controlling expressions) you may need to inspect this function as well.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value (caller implementation): the only static caller shown. To decide if expressions like (!context || !Message_Digest) or context->computed/context->corrupted can ever be invariant at the point of call, we must inspect how ws_get_accept_value constructs/passes the context and Message_Digest (are they always non-NULL? Is context always pre-initialized so computed has a fixed value?).\n\n- SHA1Reset (implementation/prototype) and SHA1Input (implementation/prototype): both are invoked by ws_get_accept_value (per the call graph). They may initialize or modify context fields (computed, corrupted, lengths, intermediate_hash). Knowing their behavior is necessary to decide whether context->computed or context->corrupted are effectively invariant at the call site of SHA1Result.\n\nIn short: to judge whether the controlling expressions in SHA1Result are invariant you must inspect the SHA1Context layout/qualifiers, the compile-time/ run-time nature of SHA1HashSize, the side-effects of SHA1PadMessage (and its callees), and how the caller(s) (ws_get_accept_value) and its use of SHA1Reset/SHA1Input prepare the context and Message_Digest arguments."
