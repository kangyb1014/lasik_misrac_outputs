  "explanation": "I flagged pointer declarations/parameters that in this function appear to point to objects that are not modified directly here and therefore merit checking whether they should point to const-qualified types (or otherwise have a more restrictive const qualification). Other code fragments are not reported because: - The string parameters are already const (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) so they comply with the rule. - upload_data_size is a pointer to size_t whose pointee is modified (*upload_data_size = 0), so it must not be const. - request->post_url is already declared const char * in the struct definition, so it already follows the rule. - session is used to modify its contents (session->start = time(NULL)), so a pointer-to-const would be inappropriate. - Many pointers are passed into external MHD_* API calls (e.g. connection, response, request passed to MHD_create_post_processor, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response); these need to be validated against the external APIs before changing const qualifiers \u2014 they are reported where this function itself does not modify the pointee (so should be reviewed). - Local allocations/initializations (calloc, assignment to request) show that the pointed-to objects are intended to be mutable, so pointers intended to allow mutation are not flagged. Please investigate the flagged fragments to determine whether const qualifiers can be safely added given the external API contracts and how the pointers are used elsewhere."
