Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The provided function is small and the only remaining text (function signature, braces and any whitespace) is structural and directly affects control flow or linkage; there are no other statements in the snippet to investigate. The listed fragments are the only locations that could represent executed operations whose removal might not change program behaviour (e.g. questionable assignment syntax, conditional branches and the ternary return). All other parts of the snippet are syntactic structure and cannot be classified as dead code on their own."
