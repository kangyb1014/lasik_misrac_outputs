  "explanation": "- tool_params (global variable): The conditionals in the function test tool_params.epoll and tool_params.select and assign tool_params.poll. To decide whether these controlling expressions are invariant you must know the actual variable (not just the member names) \u2014 whether it is a global object, its storage class, and whether it is declared const/volatile.\n- definition of the type of tool_params (struct/typedef): The member types (e.g. int, unsigned, bit-field, bool) and possible const/volatile qualifiers on the members affect whether an expression on those members can be treated as a compile-time invariant. The struct definition also shows if members are bit-fields or macro-expanded members which could influence compile-time evaluability.\n- declaration/definitions of the members tool_params.epoll, tool_params.select and tool_params.poll (their types and any qualifiers): MISRA\u2019s rule concerns \u2018\u2018invariant\u2019\u2019 controlling expressions. If any of these members are defined as compile-time constants (e.g. via const-qualified objects, macros, or enumeration constants) the conditions would be invariant. You must inspect the members\u2019 declarations to determine that.\n- the translation-unit initialization of tool_params (static initializer, if present): Even if tool_params is non-const, a static initializer alone does not make the expression invariant; but if the object is declared const and initialized to a constant value, the controlling expression becomes invariant. The initializer can show whether the value is fixed at compile-time.\n- any #define/enum that gives constant values or aliases used for the above members (e.g. macros for TRUE/FALSE or bit-field widths): If member names are aliases to macros or the code uses macros/enums that collapse the member access to a constant, that can make the controlling expression invariant. These preprocessor or enum definitions must be checked.\n\nNote: Other symbols in the function (fprintf, stderr, PERF_RPL_PARAM_* enumerators, param_name) are not needed to decide whether the controlling expressions are invariant, because they do not affect whether the tested expressions (tool_params.epoll, tool_params.select, '-' == param_name[1]) are compile-time invariant. The param_name expression is clearly runtime-dependent (function parameter) and need not be further inspected for this MISRA rule."
