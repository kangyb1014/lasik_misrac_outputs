  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the controlling expression 'tool_params.epoll' is a modifiable runtime object (a struct member) and thus not invariant. Rule 14.3 is not breached. (If 'tool_params.epoll' were a compile-time constant or a const-qualified invariant, then the rule would be violated.)"
