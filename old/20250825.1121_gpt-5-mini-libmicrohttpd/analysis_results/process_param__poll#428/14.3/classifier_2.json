  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The controlling expression 'tool_params.select' is a runtime variable (a field of the tool_params object) and therefore not a compile-time or invariant expression; Rule 14.3 is not violated. A violation would occur if the expression were invariant, e.g. if it were a compile-time constant or macro (#define SELECT 1) or a const-qualified object guaranteed to have the same value (making the condition always true or always false)."
