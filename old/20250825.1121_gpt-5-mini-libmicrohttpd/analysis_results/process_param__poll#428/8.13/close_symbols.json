  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for a MISRA-C 'pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible' analysis:\n\n- tool_params: The function reads and writes fields of this global. We must know the exact declaration to see whether any of its fields are pointer types that should be const-qualified (e.g., char * vs const char *), and whether 'poll = !0' modifies a pointer or a scalar.\n\n- type/structure of tool_params: The struct definition (types of epoll, select, poll) is required to determine whether those members are pointer types (and thus subject to const-qualification) or scalar/non-pointer types (not subject to this MISRA rule).\n\n- fprintf (declaration/prototype): The MISRA check depends on parameter constness in called library functions. The prototype shows which parameters are declared const (for example, the format string is const char *). This helps determine whether passing param_name (or any other pointer) would violate the rule or if the called API already expects const.\n\n- stderr (declaration): stderr is passed to fprintf as a pointer (FILE *). Knowing its declared type is required to assess whether it could/should be a pointer-to-const in this context and whether any usage here would trigger a const-pointer concern.\n\n- FILE (type definition): To reason about whether FILE * could be const-qualified or is appropriately non-const, the type definition and standard prototype are needed.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result (definition): The return type and the symbolic return values must be inspected to ensure no pointer-to-non-const returns are involved; confirms that the function returns enum values (not pointers) so MISRA pointer rule does not apply to the return values.\n\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR / PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR / PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: The definitions of these symbols confirm whether they are simple enum/integer constants (no pointers). If any were pointer constants, they would be relevant to const-qualification checks."
