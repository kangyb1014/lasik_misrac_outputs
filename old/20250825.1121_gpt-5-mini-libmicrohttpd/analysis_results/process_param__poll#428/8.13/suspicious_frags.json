  "explanation": "No pointer declarations in the provided code fragment violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameter is declared as const char *param_name, which satisfies the rule that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. The string literals passed to fprintf are compatible with fprintf's const char * format parameter. There are no other pointer variables, pointer parameters, pointer returns, or pointer assignments in the shown code or the provided tool_params definition that would warrant investigation under Rule 8.13. Consequently, no code fragments need to be reported for further investigation under this rule."
