  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The function uses only standard C constructs: enum type, static function storage, standard unary and ternary operators, character literal comparison, fprintf, and simple integer initializers. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __typeof__/typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly, nested functions, nonstandard pragmas, GNU case ranges, designated extension keywords (e.g. __extension__), or other documented compiler-specific language features. \n\nNote: The identifier process_param__poll contains a double underscore; while identifiers with double underscores may be reserved by the implementation, that is not itself a compiler language extension as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, so it is not reported here. Likewise, the struct initializer with repeated 0 values and the Doxygen-style comments are standard and not compiler extensions. Therefore no fragments need investigation under Rule 1.2."
