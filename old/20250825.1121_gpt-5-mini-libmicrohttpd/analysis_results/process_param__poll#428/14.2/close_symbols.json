The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA C for-loop analysis of process_param__poll:\n\n- tool_params (global variable): the function reads and writes members of this global. To determine whether any for-loop counters or loop-control flags are affected by this function you must inspect the actual global object (not just the name).\n\n- type/struct definition of tool_params: the exact types of epoll/select/poll (e.g. bool, int, macros, accessor functions) determine whether these fields are Boolean-type loop-control flags, whether accesses have side-effects, or whether assignment modifies more than the single field (e.g. via macro or function). MISRA's rule depends on the types and side effects of objects used as loop counters or flags.\n\n- tool_params.epoll (field): read here \u2014 need to know if reading it is a simple access or a macro/function call with side effects, and whether its type is Boolean (which matters when used as loop-control flag in other code).\n\n- tool_params.select (field): same reasons as epoll \u2014 must know type and side effects of reading it.\n\n- tool_params.poll (field): this function sets poll; determine whether this field is a plain scalar (and of Boolean type) or a macro/function with side effects, and whether writing it could violate the MISRA constraint of modifying loop counters/flags in loop bodies elsewhere.\n\n- process_short_param (caller) \u2014 implementation: param_name is indexed (param_name[1]). To ensure that index is safe and to see calling context (e.g. how param_name is formed/validated) inspect the callers. Also callers may contain for-loops that interact with tool_params; callers' code is necessary because MISRA counts behaviour of functions called within loop bodies and interactions across callers may reveal loop-counter usage.\n\n- process_long_param (caller) \u2014 implementation: same reasons as process_short_param: validates/creates param_name and may establish preconditions (string length) or other interactions affecting safety and potential loop interactions.\n\n- declaration/definition of fprintf and stderr (stdio.h or any local wrapper): the function calls fprintf. MISRA requires reasoning about behaviour of any functions called within a statement; to be conservative you must know if fprintf/its wrapper can modify objects that could be loop counters or flags. At minimum inspect whether fprintf is the standard library call (no mysterious side effects) or a project macro.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result and the constants PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: to fully understand return semantics (not directly about for-loops) and to ensure that returned values are not macros that expand to expressions with side effects (highly unlikely but necessary to exclude)."
