Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of try_ready_normal_body:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ntry_ready_normal_body (struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  ssize_t ret;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  response = connection->rp.response;\n  mhd_assert (connection->rp.props.send_reply_body);\n\n  if ( (0 == response->total_size) ||\n                     /* TODO: replace the next check with assert */\n       (connection->rp.rsp_write_position == response->total_size) )\n    return MHD_YES;  /* 0-byte response is always ready */\n  if (NULL != response->data_iov)\n  {\n    size_t copy_size;\n\n    if (NULL != connection->rp.resp_iov.iov)\n      return MHD_YES;\n    copy_size = response->data_iovcnt * sizeof(MHD_iovec_);\n    connection->rp.resp_iov.iov = MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (connection,\n                                                                copy_size);\n    if (NULL == connection->rp.resp_iov.iov)\n    {\n      MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&response->mutex);\n      /* not enough memory */\n      CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR (connection,\n                              _ (\"Closing connection (out of memory).\"));\n      return MHD_NO;\n    }\n    memcpy (connection->rp.resp_iov.iov,\n            response->data_iov,\n            copy_size);\n    connection->rp.resp_iov.cnt = response->data_iovcnt;\n    connection->rp.resp_iov.sent = 0;\n    return MHD_YES;\n  }\n  if (NULL == response->crc)\n    return MHD_YES;\n  if ( (response->data_start <=\n        connection->rp.rsp_write_position) &&\n       (response->data_size + response->data_start >\n        connection->rp.rsp_write_position) )\n    return MHD_YES; /* response already ready */\n#if defined(_MHD_HAVE_SENDFILE)\n  if (MHD_resp_sender_sendfile == connection->rp.resp_sender)\n  {\n    /* will use sendfile, no need to bother response crc */\n    return MHD_YES;\n  }\n#endif /* _MHD_HAVE_SENDFILE */\n\n  ret = response->crc (response->crc_cls,\n                       connection->rp.rsp_write_position,\n                       (char *) response->data,\n                       (size_t) MHD_MIN ((uint64_t) response->data_buffer_size,\n                                         response->total_size\n                                         - connection->rp.rsp_write_position));\n  if (0 > ret)\n  {\n    /* either error or http 1.0 transfer, close socket!

The callback is also expected to produce side\u2011effects (generate/fill response data and/or advance internal state). Additionally, response->crc is guarded earlier (if (NULL == response->crc) return MHD_YES;), so the call is reachable only when non-NULL. Removing the call would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
