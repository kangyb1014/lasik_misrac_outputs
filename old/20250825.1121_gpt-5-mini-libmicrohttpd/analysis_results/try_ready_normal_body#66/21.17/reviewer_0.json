True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code computes copy_size = response->data_iovcnt * sizeof(MHD_iovec_) and then does memcpy(connection->rp.resp_iov.iov, response->data_iov, copy_size) without validating response->data_iovcnt or guarding against integer overflow or verifying that response->data_iov actually refers to an object at least that large. If response->data_iovcnt is corrupted or maliciously large (or multiplication overflows on size_t), memcpy can read beyond the bounds of response->data_iov (and could also write beyond the allocated destination if allocation/overflow interactions occur). Example: a corrupted response->data_iovcnt causes copy_size to exceed the actual bytes in response->data_iov, so memcpy accesses past the source buffer \u2014 violating Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The memcpy invocation can potentially access beyond the bounds of the source (and/or the allocated destination) because copy_size is computed solely as response->data_iovcnt * sizeof(MHD_iovec_) without any validation that: (a) response->data_iov actually refers to an object at least that large, (b) response->data_iovcnt is within an expected/checked limit, or (c) the multiplication cannot overflow size_t. Although the code checks response->data_iov != NULL and that the allocation returned non-NULL, that does not guarantee the source buffer is as large as copy_size, and an integer overflow in the multiplication can cause allocation of a smaller buffer than intended and/or copying more bytes than exist \u2014 both situations would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Recommended fixes include validating data_iovcnt against a known/derived bound, checking for multiplication overflow before using the size, and ensuring the source buffer length is sufficient for copy_size."
