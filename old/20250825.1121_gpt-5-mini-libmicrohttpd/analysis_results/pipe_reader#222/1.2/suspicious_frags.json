  "explanation": "The fragments not listed do not exhibit signs of compiler language extensions. Examples of constructs that are standard C and thus were not flagged: (void) pos; local variable declarations; standard casts (e.g. (unsigned int) max when used in the _WIN32 branch); control flow (if/return); use of standard fixed-width integer types (uint64_t, size_t) and macros like INT_MAX/UINT_MAX; and preprocessor conditional compilation (#ifndef/_WIN32) which are standard preprocessor features. The listed fragments were selected because they reference non-ISO-C/POSIX items or platform-specific APIs/typedefs that commonly come from platform/compiler extensions or non-standard libraries (ssize_t, SSIZE_MAX, read(), the custom typedef MHD_SCKT_SEND_SIZE_ and the macros casting to ssize_t). These should be investigated to confirm whether they rely on compiler-specific extensions as defined in the compiler documentation."
