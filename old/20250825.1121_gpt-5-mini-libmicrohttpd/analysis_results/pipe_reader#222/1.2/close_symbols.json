  "explanation": "For each symbol below we need its definition or declaration to determine whether the target function uses any compiler/language extensions (MISRA rule check). You must inspect each symbol\u2019s definition to see if it contains compiler-specific extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions, non-standard casts, platform-only typedefs, inline asm, zero-length arrays, or other compiler-specific constructs):\n\n- struct MHD_Response: its definition (especially the type of member fd). If fd is a non-standard type (e.g. SOCKET, an alias using compiler extensions, or a macro that expands oddly) that could be a language extension.\n- MHD_SCKT_SEND_SIZE_: appears used as a cast/type in the code. We must see whether it is a typedef or macro and whether its definition uses compiler-specific extensions.\n- SSIZE_MAX: macro value (from headers). Inspect to ensure it is a plain integer macro and not produced by an extension or non-standard header.\n- UINT_MAX: inspect definition (standard macro but check header provenance for extensions).\n- INT_MAX: inspect definition (standard macro but check header provenance for extensions).\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: constant/macro used as a return value. Check its definition for non-standard expressions or extension usage.\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: same as above \u2014 inspect definition for extensions.\n- read: prototype/implementation. The declaration may be platform-specific (POSIX) and could involve non-standard linkage or attributes; the implementation might use extensions. On Windows the code path differs, so read\u2019s declaration on the relevant platform must be checked.\n- ssize_t: type alias (POSIX). Confirm whether it is a standard typedef on the target build and whether its definition uses any compiler-specific constructs.\n- uint64_t: fixed-width integer typedef (C99). Verify its header/definition to ensure it is the standard typedef and not an extension.\n- size_t: standard type; check its definition/header to ensure no compiler-specific modifications.\n- _WIN32: platform macro controlling conditional compilation. Its presence/absence changes the compiled code path; you must check the definitions included under each branch for extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols and examining their declarations/definitions in the codebase and included headers lets you determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are being used in the target function\u2019s effective compiled form."
