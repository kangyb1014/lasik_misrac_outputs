  "explanation": "To determine whether pipe_reader violates the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls you must examine every called symbol and any constructs that could hide calls to pipe_reader. The required symbols and why they are needed:\n\n- read\n  - pipe_reader calls read(...). You must resolve which function or macro this identifier denotes (system call, library wrapper, or a project-defined function/macro). If read resolves to, or transitively calls, pipe_reader (for example via a project wrapper or callback), that would create indirect recursion. Obtain the read prototype/definition and its call graph.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (definition, especially the type of the member fd)\n  - The code passes response->fd as the first argument to read. If fd is not a plain file descriptor integer but e.g. a function pointer, object with custom read method, or a structure that triggers function calls (via overloaded macros or inline functions), that could introduce an indirect call back into pipe_reader. You need the struct layout and the exact type of fd to rule this out.\n\n- MHD_SCKT_SEND_SIZE_\n  - This token is used in the third argument to read. It might be a cast, a typedef, or\u2014\u2014less likely\u2014\u2014a macro that expands to an expression or function-like invocation. You must inspect its definition to ensure it does not expand into code that calls pipe_reader (or some function path that does).\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR\n  - These return-value macros/constants are not likely to affect recursion, but you should inspect their definitions to confirm they are simple constants and not macros that expand into function calls (e.g., a macro that logs and calls a function). If they expanded to function calls that could call pipe_reader, that would create indirect recursion.\n\nNote: Other tokens in the function (SSIZE_MAX, UINT_MAX, INT_MAX, and basic typedefs like ssize_t, size_t) are constants or type names and do not normally introduce function calls; they need not be inspected for recursion unless your codebase uses unusual macros that redefine these identifiers to include code. If your build environment uses such nonstandard redefinitions, include those symbols as well."
