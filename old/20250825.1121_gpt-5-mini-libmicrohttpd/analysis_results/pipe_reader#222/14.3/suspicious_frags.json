  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant. Specifically:\n- The preprocessor conditional (#ifndef _WIN32 / #else) is a compile-time construct, not a run-time controlling expression covered by Rule 14.3.\n- The runtime if-expressions depend on non-constant values:\n  - if (SSIZE_MAX < max) and if (UINT_MAX < max) compare a constant against the parameter max, so the result can vary with the caller-supplied max.\n  - if (0 == n) and if (n < 0) depend on n, which is the return value of read(), so they are not invariant.\n- There are no loops (while/for/do-while) with constant controlling expressions present.\n- Casts in the read() calls and the (void) pos; statement are not controlling expressions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) and no fragments require further investigation for that rule."
