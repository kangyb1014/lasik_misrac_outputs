  "explanation": "No usage of any <string.h> functions is present in the provided code (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). Rule 21.17 concerns only the Standard Library string handling functions; therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under that rule.\n\nNotes on other code elements (not relevant to Rule 21.17):\n- The calls to read(...) are I/O calls, not string.h functions, so they are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.\n- The casts and bounds adjustments (comparisons with SSIZE_MAX / UINT_MAX and the casts to MHD_SCKT_SEND_SIZE_ / unsigned int) affect how many bytes are requested from read() but do not involve string.h functions; they therefore do not trigger Rule 21.17. (A separate safety review could verify that the caller ensures buf has at least 'max' bytes, but that is beyond Rule 21.17.)\n- The sentinel return values (MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR) are macros yielding ssize_t values and are irrelevant to string handling.\n\nBecause the rule specifically targets string.h functions and none are present, there are no suspicious code fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
