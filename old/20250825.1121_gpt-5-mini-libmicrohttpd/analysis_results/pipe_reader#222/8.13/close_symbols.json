  "explanation": "For deciding whether pointers in pipe_reader should be const-qualified you must know how the pointers are used and what API signatures require: \n- struct MHD_Response (full definition): shows whether the function mutates the pointed-to object or any of its members and the exact type of response->fd. If pipe_reader does not modify the pointed-to MHD_Response, the cls parameter could be const-qualified \u2014 but that must be checked against the real struct and its members. The fd member type is needed to ensure any use (passing to read) is valid with a const-qualified source.\n- declaration/typedef of the content-reader callback signature: the library API may require the parameter type to be void * (non-const). If the expected callback prototype requires a non-const cls, the function must match that prototype and cannot change to const. You need the typedef/declaration to know whether changing cls to const is permitted.\n- prototype(s) of read (POSIX and any Windows variant): read's parameter types show whether buf must be non-const (read writes into buf). If read requires void * (i.e. non-const), buf must remain non-const; this directly affects whether the char *buf parameter can/should be const-qualified.\n- definition of MHD_SCKT_SEND_SIZE_: the code casts max with this symbol; its type may affect whether changing pointer qualifications interacts with the cast or triggers additional conversions/violations.\n- definitions of MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: these are the function's return values. Their types (likely ssize_t) are needed to confirm return-type compatibility if any change to parameter constness interacts with API-level expectations (and to ensure no implicit casts would interact with const rules in the API usage context).\n- type definitions and limits (ssize_t, uint64_t, size_t, SSIZE_MAX, UINT_MAX, INT_MAX): confirm integer/limit comparisons and casts do not imply any hidden pointer/constness issues and to ensure platform-specific branches do not require different pointer qualifications.\n\nProviding these symbols allows a reviewer to determine whether cls and buf could or should be const-qualified, and whether changing them would conflict with the library/API signatures used by pipe_reader."
