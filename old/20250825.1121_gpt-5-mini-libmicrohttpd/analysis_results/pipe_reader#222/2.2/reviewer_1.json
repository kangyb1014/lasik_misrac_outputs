  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The statement \u201c(void) pos;\u201d is indeed a no-op: it evaluates nothing with no side effects and removing it will not change the runtime behaviour of the function. However, MISRA Rule 2.2 targets unintended dead code that should be removed because it has no purpose. The explicit (void)pos; idiom is a deliberate, conventional way to document/supress an unused-parameter warning, and this use is not what Rule 2.2 is intended to prohibit in practice. In other words, although the cast is semantically a no-op, it is an intentional marker rather than accidental dead code. Therefore Agent A\u2019s report is not correct: this instance should not be reported as a Rule 2.2 violation. If you want to avoid the idiom while keeping strict compliance, alternatives are to omit the parameter name in the function definition (if acceptable), or use a single, documented project-wide pattern for marking unused parameters (or a compiler annotation), rather than leaving accidental no-op statements elsewhere."
