  "explanation": "For deciding whether any part of pipe_reader is statically unreachable you must know the exact types, limits and platform-conditional compilation and the return/value semantics of the I/O call used. - struct MHD_Response: needed to know what response points to and any invariants about its contents (particularly the fd field). - response->fd (field): the type/semantics of the fd determine which read() overload/prototype is used and whether read can fail/return particular values. - read (function prototype): the return type and semantics of read (e.g. ssize_t on POSIX, or other on the target platform) determine whether n can be 0, negative, or always non\u2011negative; this affects reachability of the if (0 == n) and if (n < 0) branches. - ssize_t, size_t, uint64_t: the signed/unsigned types and their ranges are required to reason about comparisons and conversions (SSIZE_MAX < max, and casting of max for read). - SSIZE_MAX: its value/range is needed to determine if the condition SSIZE_MAX < max can ever be true at runtime (and so whether that branch is reachable). - MHD_SCKT_SEND_SIZE_: the cast/type used for the third argument to read can affect conversion/overflow behavior and thus whether the call and subsequent returns are reachable/meaningful. - _WIN32 (preprocessor symbol): this controls which compilation branch is present; unreachable code may simply be excluded by the preprocessor, so you must know whether _WIN32 is defined for the build. - UINT_MAX and INT_MAX: needed to determine whether the Windows branch condition (UINT_MAX < max) and the clamp (max = INT_MAX) can occur and thus whether that code is reachable. - MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR: their values are required to determine if the return statements produce values that could coincide with other return paths or be impossible given the function return type/expected range."
