  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to assess the MISRA rule (no modification of parameter objects themselves):\n\n- struct MHD_Response\n  - Needed to confirm what `cls` actually points to and whether any implicit modification of the pointer/object could be happening (e.g. if response is a macro or has unusual semantics). Also to verify that assigning `response = cls` is just a local pointer alias and not modifying the incoming parameter `cls`.\n\n- struct MHD_Response::fd\n  - The field accessed (response->fd) determines the type passed to read; knowing its type clarifies whether any casts or conversions might indirectly affect parameters.\n\n- read (POSIX prototype)\n  - The POSIX signature (ssize_t read(int, void *, size_t)) shows that `read` receives `buf` and `max` by value and will not modify the caller's pointer variables themselves. This is needed to reason that passing `buf` and `max` to read does not violate the rule by modifying the parameter variables in the caller.\n\n- read (Windows/CRT prototype)\n  - On Windows the CRT read signature can differ; include it to ensure the function call cannot mutate the pointer parameter variables themselves (and to confirm the third parameter's expected type when the code casts to unsigned int).\n\n- MHD_SCKT_SEND_SIZE_\n  - This macro/cast is applied to `max` in the read call. Its definition must be checked to ensure it has no side effects (e.g. it is not a function-like macro that could modify `max`) and to verify the effective type passed to read.\n\n- SSIZE_MAX\n  - Used in the non-WIN32 branch comparison and important to check types and signed/unsigned interactions with `max`. Knowing its definition and type helps determine whether the comparison/assignment expression could be interpreted in a way that does not directly assign to the parameter variable (e.g. via a macro expansion).\n\n- UINT_MAX\n  - Used in the WIN32 branch comparison; its type/definition matters for signed/unsigned comparison semantics with `max` and to confirm that assignment to `max` is a plain variable modification.\n\n- INT_MAX\n  - Used as the value assigned to `max` in the WIN32 branch; we need to check its type/definition to understand the assignment and any implicit conversion.\n\n- size_t typedef\n  - Required to confirm `max` is a by-value parameter of type size_t (not const or some wrapper) so that direct assignment `max = ...` indeed modifies a parameter variable rather than, for example, being a macro or constant.\n\n- ssize_t typedef\n  - The function return type and SSIZE_MAX are tied to ssize_t; knowing its definition helps reason about the comparisons/returns and whether special macros/types could affect parameter semantics.\n\n- uint64_t typedef\n  - To confirm the `pos` parameter type and that the `(void) pos;` line is an innocuous discard rather than some macro or overloaded identifier that could modify a parameter.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM\n  - Return constant used when n == 0; include to verify it is a simple constant (no side effect) and does not hide any macro that could affect parameter handling.\n\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR\n  - Same rationale as above for the error return.\n\n- _WIN32 macro\n  - Controls which branch is compiled. To assess whether the code modifies a parameter in any build configuration, the defined/undefined status of _WIN32 must be known so both code paths can be analysed.\n\nRationale summary: The central MISRA concern is whether the function modifies its incoming parameters (the pointer variables themselves). The code contains assignments to `max` (a parameter) and uses pointer parameters (`cls`, `buf`). To be certain those are direct parameter modifications (and not e.g. macro expansions, side-effecting macros, or other constructs that change the interpretation), the above symbols (types, macros, struct/field, and callees) must be inspected. They allow determining whether assignments are truly modifying a parameter variable (thus violating the MISRA rule) or whether some other definitions change that conclusion."
