  "explanation": "To determine whether the function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule check) the analyzer must see the actual declarations/definitions these names resolve to:\n\n- bool (typedef/keyword): needed to know whether 'bool' is the standard C99 boolean (stdbool.h/_Bool) or a compiler-specific extension/keyword or a project typedef. If 'bool' is a compiler extension the code would violate the rule.\n\n- true, false: same rationale as for 'bool' \u2014 they may be standard macros from <stdbool.h> or non-standard symbols; their origin must be verified.\n\n- mhd_assert: this macro could expand to code that uses compiler extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, __extension__, __attribute__, builtins, etc.). The macro definition must be inspected to ensure it does not rely on language extensions.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING: must see whether this is a plain enum constant or macro and whether its definition uses any extensions (e.g., unusual casting, attributes, or nonstandard constructs).\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the full struct declaration is required to check whether any of its fields use language extensions (bit-fields with nonstandard widths, anonymous structs/unions, attributes, flexible array members in nonstandard positions, compiler-specific layout pragmas, etc.).\n\n- type/definition of c->read_buffer_offset: the exact type (and any qualifiers) is needed because the code uses integer comparisons; if the type is defined via a compiler extension this matters.\n\n- type/definition of c->state: required to verify whether the state member is an enum or something defined with extensions.\n\n- definition of c->rq and its members (have_chunked_upload, remaining_upload_size, current_chunk_offset, current_chunk_size): the sub-structure and the types of these members must be inspected to ensure they are ordinary standard C declarations and do not use extensions (e.g., bit-field packing, anonymous members, attributes, compiler-specific types).\n\nProviding these symbols allows the next analyst to determine whether any of the identifiers used in the function expand to or rely on compiler-specific language extensions."
