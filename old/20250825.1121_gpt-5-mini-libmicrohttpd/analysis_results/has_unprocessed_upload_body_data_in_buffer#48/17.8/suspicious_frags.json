  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function modifies the parameter variable 'c' itself. All uses of 'c' are reads of the object it points to (c->state, c->rq.*, c->read_buffer_offset) and there are no assignments to 'c' (no c = ..., no pointer arithmetic on c, no increment/decrement of c). The mhd_assert macro is defined as ((void)0), so it cannot hide any modification of the parameter. Note that MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter; even if the code modified fields of *c that would be permitted. Because neither the pointer parameter nor the pointer variable is altered in this function, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
