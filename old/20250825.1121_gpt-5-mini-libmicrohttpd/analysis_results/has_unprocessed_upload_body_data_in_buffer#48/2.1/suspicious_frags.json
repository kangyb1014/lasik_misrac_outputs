  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are simple conditional returns that directly depend on runtime state (returns of the form \"return 0 != c->read_buffer_offset;\" and the non-chunked branch) and do not contain code placed after unconditional returns or statements that could syntactically never be reached. The comments are non-executable. The three selected fragments contain assertions and a conditional branch whose condition or asserted invariants are documented as \"must not be possible\" \u2014 these are the locations most likely to hide unreachable-code issues or violate the stated invariant assumptions and therefore warrant investigation. No other lines in the function present obvious unreachable-code patterns (e.g., code after an unconditional return, duplicated dead branches, or unreachable labels)."
