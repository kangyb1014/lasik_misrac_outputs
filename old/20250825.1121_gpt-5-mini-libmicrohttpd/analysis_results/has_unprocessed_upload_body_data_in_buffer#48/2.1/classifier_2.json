  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the mhd_assert call is a runtime assertion that documents an invariant and is executed at runtime (when assertions are enabled). It does not introduce unreachable code. If the macro compiles out to nothing in release builds the statement is simply removed, not made unreachable by control flow. Therefore Rule 2.1 is not violated by this fragment."
