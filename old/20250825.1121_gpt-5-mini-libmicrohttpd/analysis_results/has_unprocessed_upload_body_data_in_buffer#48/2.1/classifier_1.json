  "scenario": "The assertion call itself does not create unreachable code. mhd_assert used as a runtime check (e.g. expanding to a no-op in release builds or to a conditional abort only when the condition fails) does not make subsequent code unreachable, so there is no Rule 2.1 violation. A violation would occur only if mhd_assert were defined so that it unconditionally terminates or loops forever (for example #define mhd_assert(x) abort() or #define mhd_assert(x) for(;;) ), which would make all following statements unreachable."
