  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Connection (full definition): required to determine whether the pointer parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *c' and its members are declared with any const/volatile qualifiers and whether any members are accessed via modifiable or const-qualified types. This is essential to decide if the pointer parameter itself can/should be changed to point-to-const.\n\n2) type/definition of the c->rq sub-structure and its member declarations: the function reads multiple fields from c->rq (have_chunked_upload, remaining_upload_size, current_chunk_offset, current_chunk_size). You must know the exact declarations and any qualifiers (const/volatile) of these members and of the rq type to determine whether treating 'c' as pointer-to-const is valid.\n\n3) declaration/type of c->read_buffer_offset: the function reads this member; its declared type and qualifiers (e.g. volatile) are needed to assess whether the pointed-to object is effectively modifiable and if pointer-to-const is appropriate.\n\n4) MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING (enum/define): needed only to confirm that the asserted comparison is a simple read-only check (no side effects) and to fully understand the semantics, but mainly to ensure no hidden macro side effects that would require a non-const pointer.\n\n5) mhd_assert macro/function definition: the macro might expand to code that has side effects (logging, abort, or even writes). To conclude that the function performs only read-only operations on *c and therefore that the parameter could be const-qualified, we must verify that mhd_assert doesn't modify the pointed-to object or require a non-const pointer.\n\nCollecting these symbols allows checking (a) whether the function actually performs any writes through 'c' or uses members that are non-const/volatile in a way that prevents const-qualification, and (b) whether any invoked macros/expressions could require a non-const pointer. With those definitions one can determine if changing the parameter to 'const struct MHD_Connection *c' would be valid and therefore whether the current declaration violates the MISRA guidance."
