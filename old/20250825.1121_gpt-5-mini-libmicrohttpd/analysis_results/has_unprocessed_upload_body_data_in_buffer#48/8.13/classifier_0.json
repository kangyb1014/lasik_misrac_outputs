  "scenario": "The function parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *c' is only read (only member accesses and assertions are performed) and the function does not modify the pointee. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Thus the signature should be changed to 'const struct MHD_Connection *c' (or 'struct MHD_Connection const *c'). If there are no external reasons requiring a non-const pointer (e.g. macros or called functions that modify through the pointer), this is a violation."
