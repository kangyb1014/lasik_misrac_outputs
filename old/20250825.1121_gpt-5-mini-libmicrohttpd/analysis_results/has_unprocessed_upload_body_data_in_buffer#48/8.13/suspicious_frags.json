  "explanation": "The only pointer in this function is the parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *c'. The function only reads members of *c (no assignments to c or its members), so the parameter could be const-qualified (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Connection *c') and should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions in the function body to consider: all uses of c are reads (field accesses and comparisons), the function does not return any pointer, and no local pointer variables exist, so no other fragments need investigation."
