  "explanation": "Only controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The two if statements above contain controlling expressions that should be investigated to ensure they are not invariant in all builds or all states. The remaining code constructs are not controlling expressions and therefore do not fall under Rule 14.3: the mhd_assert(...) lines are assertion macros (not control statements) and may be removed or compiled out; the return statements are not control-flow conditions; the final expression used in the return (0 != c->read_buffer_offset) is not a controlling expression of a selection/iteration statement. Comments and simple comparisons used only to compute return values are not subject to this rule."
