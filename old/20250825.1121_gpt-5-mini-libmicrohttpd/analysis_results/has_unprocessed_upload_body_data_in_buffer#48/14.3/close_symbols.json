  "explanation": "To decide whether any of the controlling expressions in has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer are invariant, the analyzer needs the exact definitions and mutation sites of every quantity used in those expressions. Concretely:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): The function reads multiple members of this struct. Knowing the field types and layout is necessary to reason whether comparisons (==, !=) are invariant or always produce the same result.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING: The first mhd_assert compares c->state to this constant. You must know the value and semantics of this constant (enum/macro) to determine if the comparison is meaningful and whether c->state can actually differ.\n\n- mhd_assert macro: mhd_assert may expand to code that uses the expression in a controlling context or may be compiled out. Understanding its expansion determines whether the expression passed to it forms a controlling expression relevant to MISRA or is a no-op in production builds.\n\n- c->state (member): Knowing its type and possible values (enum) and where it can be changed is required to know if the equality test can be invariant at compile time or is determined dynamically by other code.\n\n- c->rq (request sub-structure) and its fields (have_chunked_upload, remaining_upload_size, current_chunk_offset, current_chunk_size): These fields appear directly in the controlling expressions (if (!c->rq.have_chunked_upload), the assert on remaining_upload_size, and the comparison of current_chunk_offset and current_chunk_size). You need their types and semantic meaning to decide whether those tests can be constant when the function is reached, or whether they can vary at runtime.\n\n- c->read_buffer_offset (field): Used in two controlling expressions (0 != c->read_buffer_offset). Its type and where it is modified determine whether that test could be invariant.\n\n- try_grow_read_buffer: This function manages read-buffer allocation/size changes. It (or related buffer management routines) may change read_buffer_offset or related invariants; you need it to determine if read_buffer_offset can vary while in this state.\n\n- handle_req_headers_no_space, handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space, handle_req_footers_no_space: These request-parsing routines are the likely producers/consumers of rq.* fields (have_chunked_upload, remaining_upload_size, current_chunk_*). To prove a controlling expression is not invariant you must inspect where those fields are set and how they change across states.\n\n- Any functions or code paths that set/transition c->state to MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING or that initialize/modify rq: To decide whether assertions like \"0 != remaining_upload_size must not be possible in MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING\" are guaranteed invariants, you must examine the code that transitions the connection into that state and initializes rq. If those initializers guarantee particular values, some controlling expressions could be invariant; if not, they are not.\n\nIn short: you need the concrete type/definitions of the members used in the controlling expressions and the code that initializes or mutates those members. With those symbols you can determine whether the controlling expressions are compile-time or provably runtime invariants (MISRA violation) or are legitimately dynamic checks."
