  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule about use of <string.h> functions and potential out-of-bounds accesses, the analyzer must be sure that no string.h routines are (a) invoked directly in this function or (b) invoked implicitly via macros or inline expansions, and that any offsets used cannot lead to out-of-bounds string operations elsewhere.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the function dereferences fields of the connection object; the full struct is required to see whether any of those members are in fact macros or accessors that invoke string functions, or whether any member access could alias into buffer operations.\n- rq member layout: the function inspects several fields inside rq. Knowing their precise types (signed/unsigned, width) and semantics (e.g. sentinel values) is necessary to determine whether comparisons here could hide subsequent string operations or indicate obligations about buffer lengths.\n- MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING and c->state type: mhd_assert checks state; the value and type may be part of an expression or macro that expands to other checks or side effects. Also state may encode invariants that affect buffer usage.\n- mhd_assert definition/expansion: this macro/function might expand to logging or diagnostic code that could call library functions (possibly string functions). You must inspect it to exclude hidden uses of memcpy/str* etc.\n- read_buffer_offset type and invariants: the function returns boolean based on this offset. To establish absence of string.h violations you need to know whether this offset is always within the bounds of the read buffer and how it is used elsewhere; its type (signed/unsigned) affects comparisons and potential underflow/overflow.\n- any macros/inline functions referenced (including those used by mhd_assert): macros can expand to calls to standard library string functions; include their definitions so you can prove no string.h functions are introduced indirectly.\n\nWith these symbols you can verify that the function itself does not call any <string.h> functions and that no accessed members or expanded macros introduce string.h calls or unsafe buffer indexing. Without them you cannot rule out indirect uses or hidden expansions that could violate the MISRA rule."
