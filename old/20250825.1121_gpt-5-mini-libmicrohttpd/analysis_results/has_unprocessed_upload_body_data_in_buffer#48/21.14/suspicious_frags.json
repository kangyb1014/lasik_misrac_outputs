  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related macro definition for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any string-comparison using memcmp on null-terminated strings. No call to memcmp appears in the function or the provided macro. The function only uses integer/boolean tests (comparisons against 0) and accesses members of the connection structure (e.g. have_chunked_upload, read_buffer_offset, current_chunk_offset, current_chunk_size, remaining_upload_size). The mhd_assert macro is defined as a no-op ((void)0). There are no string operations or includes shown that would indicate memcmp is being used indirectly. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
