  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings we must be sure the function (or anything it expands/calls inline) uses memcmp on strings. The following symbols are required:\n\n- mhd_assert: The assertion macro/function could expand to or call other routines. We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not invoke memcmp (directly or indirectly) on null-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING: The symbolic state constant is used in the assertion; its definition confirms it is an integer/enum constant and not a macro that expands into code which might call memcmp.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): We need the complete structure to see the types of members accessed in this function (state, rq, read_buffer_offset). If any of these members were string pointers or had accessor macros that invoked memcmp, that could cause a violation. Knowing the exact member types confirms the comparisons here are numeric, not string comparisons via memcmp.\n\n- type/definition of c->rq and its members (have_chunked_upload, remaining_upload_size, current_chunk_offset, current_chunk_size): The function inspects these members. We must verify they are integer/size types (not pointers to char or structures whose accessors might call memcmp). Also ensures there are no macros wrapping these names that expand to memcmp calls.\n\n- definition/type of c->read_buffer_offset: This symbol is compared to 0; we must confirm it is an integer/size type and not a pointer/array or accessor macro that could hide a memcmp usage.\n\n- definition of false/true/bool: Confirm these are the usual boolean macros/_Bool and not macros that expand into function calls that might use memcmp.\n\nWith these symbols examined we can conclude whether any code visible to the target function (including macros and member accesses) uses memcmp to compare NUL\u2011terminated strings. No other functions are called from this function, so only the above definitions can introduce hidden memcmp usage."
