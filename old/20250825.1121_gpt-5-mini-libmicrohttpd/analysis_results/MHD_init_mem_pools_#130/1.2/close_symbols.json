  "explanation": "For deciding whether this function uses any compiler language extensions (the MISRA rule in question) the analyzer must inspect the definitions/declarations of the following symbols because they are the only places an extension could be hidden or introduced:\n\n- MHD_SC_PAGESIZE: a preprocessor macro tested by #ifdef. Its definition (or use as a compiler-provided macro) could itself rely on compiler-specific macros or extensions.\n- sysconf: a library function. On some toolchains this is a non\u2011standard/POSIX function or could be mapped to a compiler intrinsic/extension; its declaration will show whether a non\u2011standard/extension API is used.\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: the variable assigned here. Its type, qualifiers or definition could use compiler extensions (e.g. attributes, packed/aligned extensions) that would violate the rule.\n- MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_: default page size macro used in fallbacks. The macro expansion could use compiler extensions (e.g. GCC-specific __extension__ or statement expressions).\n- _WIN32: platform macro controlling the #elif branch. The build environment or its definition may cause use of Windows API symbols that are non\u2011standard; the analyzer should confirm whether selecting this branch implies any extension use.\n- SYSTEM_INFO: Windows API struct used in the _WIN32 branch. Its definition might include compiler-specific annotations or rely on non\u2011standard headers; examine to ensure no language extensions are used in its declaration.\n- GetSystemInfo: Windows API call used in the _WIN32 branch. Some platform APIs are provided via compiler/headers that might use extensions or intrinsics; inspect its declaration/headers.\n- size_t: the target cast uses size_t. Although standard, the typedef location (headers) should be confirmed not to rely on extensions or compiler-specific typedef tricks.\n- mhd_assert: assertion macro invoked at the end. Its expansion could contain compiler extensions (builtins, statement-expressions, attributes) \u2014 must inspect the macro definition.\n- ALIGN_SIZE: used in the assert expression. Its definition could hide extension usage (e.g. use of typeof, statement-expression, or attribute macros).\n\nBy retrieving these symbols (macro definitions and function/type declarations) the next agent can determine if any use of compiler\u2011specific language extensions (attributes, builtins, statement-expressions, typeof, inline assembly, nested functions, __extension__, etc.) occurs in this function or in items it directly relies on."
