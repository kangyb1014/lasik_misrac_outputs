  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. I found no occurrences of extension constructs such as: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin_* identifiers, __asm or asm statements, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, typeof, nested functions, Microsoft __declspec, __inline__/__forceinline compiler-only keywords, zero-length arrays as extension, or other vendor-specific language keywords. The code uses standard preprocessor conditionals, standard casts, standard operators, POSIX sysconf and Windows API calls (platform APIs \u2014 not language extensions), and ordinary macros. The preprocessor usage to select page-size macros and the use of identifiers beginning with an underscore are not compiler language extensions (identifier-reservation concerns are a different conformity issue). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
