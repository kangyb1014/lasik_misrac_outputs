  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns the use of the C <string.h> functions (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) and ensuring their pointer parameters do not cause out-of-bounds accesses. The supplied function MHD_init_mem_pools_ and the related macros/definitions do not invoke any of those standard string-handling functions. The function only calls sysconf (or GetSystemInfo on Windows), performs integer-to-size_t casting and assignment, and uses mhd_assert which is defined as a no-op. The macros shown (MHD_SC_PAGESIZE, MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_, ALIGN_SIZE, etc.) do not expand to string.h calls. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that are relevant for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
