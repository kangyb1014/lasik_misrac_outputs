  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_init_mem_pools_ can violate the MISRA rule about use of <string.h> functions, the next analyst must be able to inspect any symbols that could themselves call, expand to, or reference string-handling functions (or otherwise cause out-of-bounds accesses via pointer parameters). Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- MHD_SC_PAGESIZE: This compile-time macro selects the sysconf branch. We must know whether this macro is defined to know which code is compiled; also check any macro expansion for hidden uses of string functions.\n\n- _WIN32: This preprocessor symbol determines whether the Windows branch (GetSystemInfo) is used. Its presence/absence changes the compiled code path that must be inspected.\n\n- sysconf: The function called when MHD_SC_PAGESIZE is used. Although sysconf itself does not normally use <string.h> functions, wrappers or platform-specific implementations could; inspect its declaration/implementation (or any project wrapper) to ensure no string.h calls.\n\n- GetSystemInfo: The Windows API used in the _WIN32 branch. Inspect any local wrapper or macro around this call to ensure it does not invoke string-handling functions or copy into buffers using string.h functions.\n\n- SYSTEM_INFO: The structure whose field (dwPageSize) is read. Confirm that no embedded character-array fields or user wrappers around this structure use string functions; verify the field type is numeric (so no string operations involved).\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: The global (or static) variable being assigned. Its type and declaration must be checked to ensure it is not a pointer to a buffer that could later be used with string.h functions, or that its write might invoke side-effects that use string functions.\n\n- MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_: The fallback page size macro/constant. Inspect any complex macro definition for hidden string function usage or side-effects.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Used in the final assertion. Check its definition (value and type) to ensure no macro expansion performs string operations.\n\n- mhd_assert: The assertion macro/function used at the end. Assertions often expand to logging or diagnostics that can call string functions (e.g., formatting functions that internally use strlen/memcpy). The definition must be inspected to ensure no <string.h> functions are used or that any buffer operations are bounds-safe.\n\n- size_t: The type used for assignments/casts. Knowing the exact typedef ensures casts/assignments do not hide pointer/array semantics that could be misinterpreted as string operations; also helps verify the arithmetic and modulo semantics in the assertion.\n\nIn short: none of the visible statements in MHD_init_mem_pools_ directly call functions from <string.h>, but to prove MISRA compliance you must inspect the above symbols (their declarations/definitions/macros and any wrappers) to ensure they do not expand to or call string-handling functions that could access memory out of bounds."
