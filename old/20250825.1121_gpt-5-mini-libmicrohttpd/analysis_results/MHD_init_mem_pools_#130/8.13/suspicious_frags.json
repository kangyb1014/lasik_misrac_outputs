  "explanation": "No other fragments require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce or pass pointers that could/should be const-qualified. The sysconf call and its result use scalar (long) values, and the assignments to MHD_sys_page_size_ are to a size_t scalar (not a pointer). The use of conditional compilation and mhd_assert involve no pointer declarations or pointer parameters that could be const-qualified. Therefore the only fragment with pointer usage in this function that warrants investigation is the call to GetSystemInfo(&si)."
