  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for MISRA C pointer-const analysis:\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_ (declaration): determine whether this identifier is a pointer type or an integer type. The MISRA rule applies only to pointer declarations; if MHD_sys_page_size_ were a pointer, its declaration must be checked for possible const qualification.\n\n- MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_ (macro/definition): this macro is used as a fallback value. Its definition could be an expression or cast that involves pointer types; verify it does not introduce pointer usage that would trigger the const-pointer rule.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE (macro/definition): used in the modulus expression inside mhd_assert. If ALIGN_SIZE expands to or involves pointers (e.g., via casts), that could create pointer usage needing const qualification; confirm it is an integer constant.\n\n- MHD_SC_PAGESIZE (compile-time macro): controls which compilation branch is used. The analysis must know which branch is active (POSIX sysconf path, Windows GetSystemInfo path, or default) to identify the actual pointer usage in the compiled code.\n\n- sysconf (declaration/prototype): present in the POSIX branch \u2014 include its prototype to confirm it does not take pointer arguments and thus does not implicate the pointer-const rule.\n\n- GetSystemInfo (declaration/prototype): used in the Windows branch and takes a pointer to SYSTEM_INFO. Its prototype (pointer-to-parameter mutability) is required to judge whether the API legitimately requires a non-const pointer (i.e., it writes to the structure) or could/should accept a const pointer.\n\n- SYSTEM_INFO (structure definition): needed to see whether passing &si is passing a mutable object and whether any fields or embedded pointers in the struct might implicate const qualification concerns.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function declaration): used in the final check. Include its definition to ensure it does not take or evaluate pointer arguments that might need const qualification (or to confirm it is purely an expression/assert macro).\n\n- size_t typedef: to confirm it is an integer type and not a typedef to a pointer type (very unlikely but necessary to be sure no pointer types are hidden behind typedefs).\n\nThese symbols let the next analyzer determine which branch is compiled, whether any pointer types are present in the compiled path, and if any pointer parameters or objects should be const-qualified according to the MISRA rule."
