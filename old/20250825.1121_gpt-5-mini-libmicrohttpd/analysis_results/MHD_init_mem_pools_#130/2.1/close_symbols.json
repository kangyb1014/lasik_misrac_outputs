  "explanation": "To decide whether any part of MHD_init_mem_pools_ is unreachable you must know which preprocessor branches are actually compiled and whether runtime branches can ever be taken. For that you need:\n\n- MHD_SC_PAGESIZE (preprocessor macro): The top #ifdef controls whether the sysconf-based branch is emitted. If defined, the other branches (#elif defined(_WIN32) / #else) are not compiled \u2014 essential to determine compile-time reachable code.\n\n- _WIN32 (preprocessor macro): The #elif checks this; knowing whether it is defined determines whether the Windows branch or the default branch is compiled.\n\n- sysconf (function and its semantics/return values): The if/else inside the MHD_SC_PAGESIZE branch depends on sysconf returning -1 or not. To judge whether the else-path is potentially reachable you need the function declaration and behavior (can it return -1 for page-size queries on target platforms?).\n\n- GetSystemInfo (function) and SYSTEM_INFO / dwPageSize (struct member): If the _WIN32 branch is compiled, you must know the API call used and that dwPageSize provides the page size; needed to confirm that code in that branch is meaningful and potentially reachable when compiled.\n\n- MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_ (macro/constant): Used in the fallback #else branch; knowing its definition is needed to reason about whether that branch is intentionally used and whether any subsequent code depends on its value.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_ (global variable): The function writes this variable in every branch; you must know its declaration/type and whether writes are observable/used elsewhere to determine if code is redundant or dead.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE (macro/constant): Used in the final mhd_assert expression; you must know its value (and whether it is a compile-time constant) to see if the assert expression can be computed as always true/false, which affects whether the assert code is unreachable or provably always taken.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function): The assert invocation may be a macro that compiles away in some builds or expands to code that can produce unreachable behavior; you need its definition to determine whether the final check constitutes reachable code.\n\nNote: The primary determinants of compile-time unreachable code here are the preprocessor macros (MHD_SC_PAGESIZE and _WIN32). The runtime reachability of the inner sysconf-based branches requires sysconf semantics; the remaining symbols are needed to reason about whether statements are ever executed or can be optimized away (e.g., by assert macro being no-op)."
