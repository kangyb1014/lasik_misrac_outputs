  "explanation": "Other fragments in the provided code (function signature, braces, simple local declarations and simple casts/assignments outside the listed preprocessor/initialization/assertion parts) do not warrant investigation for unreachable-code under MISRA Rule 2.1 because they are syntactically required and are not conditional or otherwise prevented from executing in the compiled translation unit. The suspect regions listed above cover: (a) all conditional compilation branches that determine which code is actually compiled (these must be checked to ensure no branch is effectively dead in the project configuration), (b) the static initializer that may make runtime initialization redundant, (c) the assertion macro definition that is a no-op, and (d) the alignment macro used in the assertion. Other lines not listed are simple, unconditional statements or declarations that are reachable in the compiled output and therefore do not represent unreachable code for purposes of Rule 2.1."
