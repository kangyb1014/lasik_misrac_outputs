  "explanation": "You must inspect these symbols to determine whether this function could violate the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Reasons:\n\n- MHD_SC_PAGESIZE (macro): Controls which compilation branch is active. You need to know whether the code path that is compiled might pull in calls/macros that use memcmp.\n\n- _WIN32 (macro): Same as above for the Windows branch selection. Which branch is compiled changes which symbols (e.g. GetSystemInfo) are relevant.\n\n- sysconf (function): Called when MHD_SC_PAGESIZE is defined. Inspect its declaration/implementation (or the wrapper used) to ensure it does not indirectly invoke memcmp or any string comparisons using memcmp.\n\n- GetSystemInfo (Win32 API function): Called on the Windows branch. Verify the call or any local wrapper does not expand/route to code that uses memcmp for null-terminated strings.\n\n- SYSTEM_INFO / si.dwPageSize (struct and field): Presence/usage of this struct/field determines the Windows branch behavior; inspect any local definitions/wrappers that could hide string comparisons.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_ (global variable): Target of assignment. Inspect its declaration (and any put/set accessor macros) to ensure assignments are plain stores and not wrappers that perform string comparisons via memcmp.\n\n- MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_ (macro): Used as fallback value. Inspect its definition in case it expands to an expression or macro that uses string routines or memcmp.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE (macro): Used in the assertion modulus. Inspect definition to ensure it is an integer constant and not a macro that expands to code performing string comparisons.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function): Called at the end. This is a high-priority symbol to inspect: an assert macro or wrapper could expand to logging or diagnostics that use string handling functions (possibly memcmp). You must check its definition to be sure it does not call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- size_t (typedef): Confirm type definitions and include context; while unlikely to be the source of memcmp, ensure there are no surprising typedefs or macros that map size_t to something triggering string comparisons.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/implementations of the above macros, functions, globals, and wrappers to be sure none expand or call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings on any compiled path of MHD_init_mem_pools_."
