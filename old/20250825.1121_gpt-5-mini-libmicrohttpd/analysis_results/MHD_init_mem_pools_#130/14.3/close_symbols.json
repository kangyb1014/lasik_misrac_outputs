  "explanation": "- MHD_SC_PAGESIZE: Controls the compile-time branch that decides whether sysconf() is used. Whether this macro is defined determines which runtime controlling expressions are actually present, so it is needed to judge invariance.\n- _WIN32: Controls the compile-time branch for the Windows path (GetSystemInfo). Whether this is defined changes which runtime assignment and potential control expressions execute.\n- sysconf: The 'if (-1 != result)' controlling expression depends on the value returned from sysconf(MHD_SC_PAGESIZE). You must know sysconf semantics/possible return values (and whether it could be a constant or stub) to decide if that if-condition is invariant.\n- GetSystemInfo: On Windows the page size is taken from SYSTEM_INFO.dwPageSize; you need this function/ABI semantics to know whether that value can vary at runtime (affecting invariance of subsequent checks).\n- SYSTEM_INFO: The structure and its member dwPageSize explain the source and range of values assigned to MHD_sys_page_size_ on Windows; needed to determine if subsequent expressions are invariant.\n- MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_: The fallback compile-time constant used when sysconf is not used or fails. If this constant (together with ALIGN_SIZE) makes the assertion expression constant, the assertion/related checks could be invariant.\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: Global variable assigned in this function and used in the assertion (and possibly elsewhere). Its possible values (from sysconf/GetSystemInfo or MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_) determine whether the controlling expressions are invariant.\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Used in the modulus expression inside mhd_assert (0 == (MHD_sys_page_size_ % ALIGN_SIZE)). Knowing its value is necessary to determine whether that expression is invariant (always true/false).\n- mhd_assert: The macro expansion may introduce control constructs (and may be compiled out). You need its definition to know whether the assertion constitutes a C controlling expression subject to the MISRA rule and whether that expression is evaluated at runtime.\n\nThese symbols collectively determine which conditional/controlling expressions exist at compile time and whether their values can vary at runtime; thus they are necessary to decide if the function violates MISRA C \"controlling expressions shall not be invariant.\""
