  "explanation": "I selected the platform-specific branches and the final assertion for investigation because dead-code questions here depend on build configuration and on whether these operations have observable effects in the produced binary. The remaining code in the snippets provided (function prologue/epilogue, the call site in MHD_init, and other initialization calls shown in the additional code) should not be investigated for Rule 2.2 for these reasons:\n\n- Code excluded by preprocessor (other #ifdef branches not active in the translation unit) is not part of the compiled program and therefore not runtime dead code; it must be considered only for the build configurations where it is active.\n- The call MHD_init_mem_pools_() from MHD_init is an active call that produces observable effects (initialization) and therefore is not dead code.\n- Other initialization calls in MHD_init (WSAStartup, gnutls_global_init, gcry_check_version, MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_init, MHD_send_init_static_vars_) have observable side effects or can cause program termination on failure; their removal would change program behaviour, so they are not dead.\n- Variable declarations and assignments that initialize globals used elsewhere are likely to have observable effects and thus are not candidates for dead code without further whole-program analysis.\n\nThe platform-dependent assignments and the assert are the fragments that need investigation to determine whether, in the specific build(s) and runtime conditions, they are executed but removable without changing behaviour (i.e., true dead code under Rule 2.2)."
