  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasoning:\n- The function MHD_init_mem_pools_ has no parameters (void), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated within this function.\n- The only local variable modified is result (assigned from sysconf) and the global MHD_sys_page_size_ (assigned from result, constants, or si.dwPageSize). These are not function parameters.\n- sysconf is called with a value argument (macro expanding to an integer constant); passing by value cannot result in modification of a caller parameter.\n- GetSystemInfo(&si) passes the address of a local variable; modifying the object pointed-to is allowed by the rule (the rule forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself, not the pointed-to object). The address expression &si is not a function parameter of MHD_init_mem_pools_.\n- The mhd_assert(ignore) macro discards its parameter and expands to ((void)0), so it does not modify any function parameter.\n- Macros and constant assignments (MHD_SC_PAGESIZE, MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_, ALIGN_SIZE, etc.) do not introduce parameter modification.\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in the provided function that require investigation for Rule 17.8."
