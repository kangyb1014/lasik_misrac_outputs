  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_init_mem_pools_ violates the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d we must ensure that none of the referenced symbols expand to or dereference/alias a parameter of this function (even indirectly). The listed symbols are the external/preprocessor/function/object names used in the function; each must be inspected as follows:\n\n- MHD_SC_PAGESIZE: Preprocessor conditional. Verify how it is defined (macro or not) because a macro expansion could (rarely) refer to identifiers that change the meaning of the code. Ensure it does not hide or introduce parameter-like identifiers.\n\n- _WIN32: Preprocessor conditional selecting the Windows branch. Needed to know which branch is active and whether that branch contains operations that could modify parameters.\n\n- sysconf: External function (or macro). Confirm it does not expand to something that modifies parameters of MHD_init_mem_pools_ (the target has no parameters, but a macro could introduce identifiers). Also verify its prototype to ensure no unexpected side effects on caller parameters.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: Lvalue assigned in the function. Must be checked to see whether it is a plain global object or a macro/function-like alias that could resolve to an expression involving a function parameter (which would imply modification of a parameter). Confirm it is not a parameter alias.\n\n- MHD_DEF_PAGE_SIZE_: Macro/constant used as fallback. Verify it is a constant and not a macro that expands into something that can modify parameters or introduce parameter names.\n\n- SYSTEM_INFO: Type used for local variable 'si' in the Windows branch. Confirm the structure/typedecl is normal and not a macro that expands to code that could reference function parameters.\n\n- GetSystemInfo: External API call that takes &si. Inspect its prototype/definition to ensure it does not (via macro expansion) reference or modify parameters of MHD_init_mem_pools_. Also confirm it only modifies the local 'si', not any caller parameters.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Macro/constant used in the assertion. Check that it is a constant or expression and does not expand to something that references or modifies parameters.\n\n- mhd_assert: Assertion macro/function. Must be inspected because assertion macros can be implemented as multi-statement macros that may reference or modify identifiers; ensure it does not modify any function parameter (again the target has none, but expansion could introduce parameter-like behavior).\n\nIf all of the above are ordinary macros/objects/functions that do not expand to or alias function parameters, then MHD_init_mem_pools_ (which has no formal parameters) cannot violate the MISRA rule about modifying a parameter."
