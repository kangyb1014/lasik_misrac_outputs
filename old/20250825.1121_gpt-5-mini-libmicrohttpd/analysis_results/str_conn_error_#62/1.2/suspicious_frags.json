  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions that are commonly documented as extensions (for example: GNU/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, MSVC __declspec, or other vendor keywords). The function uses standard C constructs (static, const, pointer-to-char, switch/case, return) and macros. The identifiers and macros shown (_(...) and mhd_assert) are ordinary macros (mhd_assert is defined as ((void)0) in the provided additional code) and are not compiler language extensions. The ssize_t type is a POSIX typedef (implementation-provided), not a compiler language extension per se; if the build environment lacks ssize_t that is a portability/header issue rather than a documented compiler language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
