  "explanation": "I found no uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the provided function. The function only returns string literals wrapped with the _() macro; string literals reside in static storage and are not subject to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses by the string.h routines. The mhd_assert macro is a no-op ((void)0) and the other provided symbols are integer macros, none of which perform string handling. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
