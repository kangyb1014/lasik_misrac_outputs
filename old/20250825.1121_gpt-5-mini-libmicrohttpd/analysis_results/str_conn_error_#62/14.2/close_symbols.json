Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "The target function contains no for statements itself, so it cannot directly violate the MISRA \"for loop shall be well-formed\" rule. The only way a violation could be hidden is via macro expansions or called macros/functions that expand into (or invoke) for loops or that have side effects relevant to loop counters. The listed symbols are all identifiers referenced in the function whose definitions must be inspected to be sure they do not introduce for-statements or inappropriate side effects:\n\n- _ : Typically a translation macro/function (gettext-style). Must be checked because it may be a macro that expands to code (or calls) that could contain for loops or cause persistent side effects.\n- mhd_assert : An assertion macro; could expand to code (e.g., logging, checks) that might include loops or modify objects. Inspect its definition to ensure it does not introduce for loops or modify potential loop counters.\n- MHD_ERR_AGAIN_, MHD_ERR_CONNRESET_, MHD_ERR_NOTCONN_, MHD_ERR_NOMEM_, MHD_ERR_BADF_, MHD_ERR_INVAL_, MHD_ERR_OPNOTSUPP_, MHD_ERR_PIPE_, MHD_ERR_TLS_ : These are token names used in switch cases. Normally they are integer constants or enum values, but if any are macros with complex expansion they could hide code with loops or side effects. Verify they are plain constants (or enums) and do not expand to statements/expressions containing for loops or modifying objects.\n\nIf all of the above are simple constants/macros/functions without embedded for-loops or side effects, no further symbols are required and the target function cannot violate the MISRA for-loop rule because it contains no for statements."
