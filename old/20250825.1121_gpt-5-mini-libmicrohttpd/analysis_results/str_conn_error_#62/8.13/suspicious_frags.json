  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and const qualification. In this function the only pointer-related declaration is the function return type (static const char *), and the returned expressions are all invocations of the _(...) macro. The potential issue to investigate is whether _(\u2026) yields a non-const (char *) pointer while the function returns const char *; that could indicate inconsistent const qualification and should be checked. No other pointer declarations, pointer parameters, casts to/from pointer types, or pointer assignments appear in the snippet, so switch/case labels, the default/if logic, mhd_assert(0), and numeric comparisons are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and do not need investigation for this rule."
