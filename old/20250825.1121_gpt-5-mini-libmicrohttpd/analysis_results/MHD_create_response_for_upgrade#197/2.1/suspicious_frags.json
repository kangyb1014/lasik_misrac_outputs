  "explanation": "No unreachable code was detected in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- All conditional returns (NULL checks after the upgrade_handler and after allocation) are legitimate early exits; code following them is reachable when those checks pass.\n- The thread-initialization block is guarded by a preprocessor condition (#if defined(...)). When that block is compiled in it contains a reachable failure path (free(response); return NULL;). When it is not compiled in, those statements are not present \u2014 they are not unreachable code in the built translation unit.\n- The call to MHD_add_response_header() is a runtime call whose return value determines the subsequent branch; there is no statically-unreachable branch in the translation unit itself.\n- There are no statements after the final return, no unused labels, no #if 0 blocks, nor any constant conditions that make a branch impossible at compile time in the shown code.\n\nGiven these points, there are no code fragments in this function that appear to be statically unreachable and in need of investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
