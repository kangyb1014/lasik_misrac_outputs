  "explanation": "I selected all declarations and function-signature fragments in the provided code that involve pointer types which might reasonably be const-qualified (closure pointers, struct-pointer fields, iovec pointer, and the upgrade-handler function typedef parameters). These are the locations where Rule 8.13 could apply and thus should be investigated. I did not include fragments that are already const-qualified (for example: \"const char *data\" and string literals like \"Upgrade\"), nor non-pointer fields (integers, sizes, enums, mutex object type) because Rule 8.13 is specific to pointer target types. I also did not include obvious memory-management calls (MHD_calloc_, free, MHD_add_response_header) since they do not declare pointer types whose target could be const-qualified. The listed fragments cover the remaining pointer-bearing declarations and parameters that merit review for possible const qualification."
