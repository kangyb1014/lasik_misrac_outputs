  "scenario": "data_iov is declared as MHD_iovec_ * but (given the surrounding API: const char *data used for read-only response buffers, and the member is described as an I/O vector used to provide response data) it is likely only read by the implementation and not modified. In that case the pointer should be to a const-qualified pointee (const MHD_iovec_ *data_iov) to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If the implementation does not modify the iovec elements, the current non-const declaration violates Rule 8.13. If the implementation does need to modify the iovec elements, then the non-const is justified."
