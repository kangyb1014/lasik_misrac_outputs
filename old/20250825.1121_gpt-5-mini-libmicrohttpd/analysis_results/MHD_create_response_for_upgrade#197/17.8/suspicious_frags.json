  "explanation": "No code fragment in MHD_create_response_for_upgrade modifies a function parameter. The two parameters are: (1) upgrade_handler (function pointer) and (2) upgrade_handler_cls (void *). Both are only read and their values are copied into members of the newly allocated response object (response->upgrade_handler and response->upgrade_handler_cls). There are no assignments to the parameter variables themselves, no increment/decrement or other modifying operators applied to them, and their addresses are not taken and passed to other functions that could modify them. All other operations (memory allocation, mutex init, setting response fields, calling MHD_add_response_header) operate on the local response object or local temporaries, not on the parameter variables. Therefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
