  "explanation": "I reported all uses of standard string-handling functions and expressions that index characters adjacent to substrings found with strstr, because these are the locations most likely to produce out-of-bounds accesses per MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Other fragments were not reported because they do not call functions from <string.h> or do not perform character-pointer indexing that could lead to out-of-bounds access: - body_compress uses compression APIs (compress/compressBound) and malloc/free, not string.h functions. - The PAGE macro is a compile-time string literal (concatenated literals) so strdup/strlen operate on a well-formed NUL-terminated object. - The wrapper MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback and the response queueing/destroy calls do not use <string.h> functions and thus fall outside Rule 21.17. - The can_compress condition that checks de[-1] and de[strlen(\"deflate\")] is included in the suspicious fragments list (so its safety should be verified); other surrounding logic that does not call string.h functions or does not perform pointer indexing was not included because it cannot directly cause string.h related out-of-bounds accesses. Please investigate each reported fragment to confirm that pointer values are non-NULL, that strings are NUL-terminated where required, and that any indexing is guarded appropriately."
