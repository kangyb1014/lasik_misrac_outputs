  "explanation": "The flagged fragments are assertions and the two identical 'else pw += 2' increment branches. Assertions (mhd_assert calls) are suspicious for dead-code inspection because assertion macros often compile to no-ops in production builds; if they have no effect when removed, they may constitute dead code or at least deserve review to ensure they have no side effects relied upon. The two 'else pw += 2' branches are subtle pointer adjustments that might be redundant in some code paths; they should be inspected to verify they are necessary and not removable without changing behavior.\n\nAll other code constructs were not flagged because they perform observable behaviour that affects the result: token parsing loops, the token-finding logic, string-comparison calls (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_), the code that sets *str_len and token_removed, the copy/move logic (including memmove), pointer increments (pr/pw adjustments), loop control (break/continue), and the final return. Removing or altering these would change program behaviour (e.g. which tokens are removed, the string contents, or function return), so they are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2 and therefore need not be investigated for dead-code removal."
