True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe assertion call invokes memchr solely to check for a NUL within tokens: mhd_assert (NULL == memchr (tokens, 0, tokens_len)); This performs an operation (the memchr call) whose removal would not affect normal program behaviour (the tokens buffer is expected to be valid and the check has no side effects). If mhd_assert is compiled out (as typical for assert-like macros) the call is omitted; conversely when compiled in it only performs a runtime check/abort on failure. Because the memchr call has no effect on the correct program\u2019s observable behaviour, it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The memchr call is embedded in mhd_assert; when the assertion is enabled that call can change observable behaviour (it can detect a programming/validation failure and typically abort or log). Removing the memchr/assert would therefore change behaviour for inputs that violate the assertion, so the operation is not dead. If the project config compiles out assertions, then the memchr call is simply not present in that build \u2014 code that is not present cannot be classified as dead code in the build where it does not exist. In short, because the assertion can have observable effects when triggered, the memchr is not dead code and the reported violation of Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
