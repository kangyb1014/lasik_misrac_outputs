This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

    "memchr",

    "mhd_assert"
  ],
  "explanation": "- memchr: Called at the top (mhd_assert(NULL == memchr(tokens, 0, tokens_len))). To judge MISRA <string.h> rule compliance we must inspect the memchr call site: that the tokens pointer is valid for tokens_len bytes and memchr is not invoked with out-of-range length. Also memchr is a <string.h> function covered by the rule.\n\n- memmove: Called later to copy the tail of the string (memmove (str + pw, str + pr, copy_size)). The safety of this standard <string.h> function invocation depends on the pointer/length arguments (str+pw, str+pr, copy_size) being within the bounds of the object referenced by str and on correct overlap handling. We must inspect how pw, pr, and copy_size are computed from *str_len to ensure no out-of-bounds access.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: This helper is used multiple times to compare tokens (e.g. MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_(str + pr, tkn, tkn_len)). To conclude that the target function does not cause out-of-bounds string accesses we must know the exact behavior and contract of this function (does it only read exactly n bytes; does it call memcmp/memchr internally; does it read past n bytes) and ensure calls pass valid pointers/lengths.\n\n- mhd_assert: Used throughout to check invariants that bound indices/lengths. We must know its definition/expansion (is it compiled out in production builds; does it evaluate its argument more than once or have side effects) because it affects whether potential out-of-bounds accesses would be guarded at runtime and whether the expressions inside the asserts themselves perform any additional memory accesses.\n\n(Reasoning summary: the MISRA rule concerns safe use of standard <string.h> APIs and any helper that reads memory. To verify compliance we need the exact implementations/contracts of the above symbols and their parameter usage so we can prove that memchr/memmove and any comparison routine never access memory beyond the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.)"
