  "explanation": "To judge whether this function violates the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible, the analyser must know which callees require or accept const-qualified pointer targets and whether any macros cast away const. Each listed symbol can change whether a pointer parameter/type in this function could or should be const:\n\n- memchr (void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n))\n  Reason: memchr is called with 'tokens' (a const char *const). The prototype shows whether the callee accepts a const-qualified source pointer and whether it returns a non-const pointer (which might force casts). Knowing the exact signature is necessary to confirm that passing 'tokens' as const is correct and that no const is being removed/required by the call.\n\n- memmove (void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n))\n  Reason: memmove is used to copy from str+pr to str+pw. The prototype shows that the source parameter is const-qualified while destination is non-const. This verifies that str must be mutable (non-const) for use as dest; it also shows that callers accept const for src. That affects whether 'str' or other pointers could be upgraded to point-to-const.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (prototype/definition)\n  Reason: This project-specific function is invoked with pointers to both 'str' (mutable) and tokens (const). Its declaration/definition must be inspected to know whether its parameters are declared as const-qualified (e.g., const char *) or as non-const (char *). If it lacks const on pointer parameters or internally casts away const, that would force the caller pointers to be non-const and could indicate a MISRA violation (or a reason why 'str'/'tokens' cannot be const).\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/definition)\n  Reason: mhd_assert is used with memchr(...) result and other expressions. If this macro contains casts, pointer manipulations, or non-obvious usages that remove const-qualification (or require non-const pointers), that would affect whether the pointers in this function can/should be const. The exact definition is needed to ensure the asserts do not conceal const-qualification violations.\n\nNote: Standard typedefs (size_t, bool) and literals (NULL) are not listed because they do not affect pointer const-qualification decisions for the analyzed parameters. The above symbols are the ones whose prototypes/definitions can require or remove const on pointer targets and thus are necessary to determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
