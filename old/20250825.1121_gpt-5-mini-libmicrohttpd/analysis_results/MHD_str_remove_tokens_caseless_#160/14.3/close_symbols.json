Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You need the definitions/semantics of these external symbols to decide whether any controlling expression in MHD_str_remove_tokens_caseless_ is actually invariant (or effectively invariant) or whether infinite-loop usage is intentional and permitted by the MISRA exception: \n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: This function/macro appears in several conditional expressions that drive control flow (if and if inside the big do/while). If it is a macro that can expand to a compile-time constant, or if it has side effects that change arguments or global state, that could make the controlling expressions effectively invariant or change whether loop exit conditions can ever become true. To assess invariance you must know its signature, return behavior, and whether it can be evaluated to a constant.\n\n- mhd_assert: The assert macro is used repeatedly inside loops. An assert implementation that aborts, returns, longjmps, or otherwise modifies control flow will affect whether constructs such as the do { } while (1) are intended to be infinite (with internal breaks) or are effectively terminated by the assert. Also a non-standard mhd_assert that expands to an expression with side effects could affect invariance analysis.\n\n- memchr: Used in the initial assertion that tokens contains no NUL bytes. The presence/absence of NUL bytes in tokens affects how the token-parsing loops behave; understanding memchr semantics (and whether the initial assertion can be elided by a macro) is necessary to know whether the token loops' controlling expressions can become invariant or not.\n\n- memmove: Used to copy tail data and to set *str_len. Its semantics determine whether *str_len and the buffer contents change as assumed by later loop conditions; these changes affect whether conditions that test *str_len or buffer contents are invariant.\n\n- size_t, bool, NULL: Standard types/macros. Knowing their definitions (especially that bool is a real boolean type and what NULL expands to) is necessary to correctly interpret comparisons like '*str_len != 0' and the literal constant usage (e.g. while(1) is an integer constant expression). \n\nIn short: MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_, mhd_assert, memchr and memmove can affect whether the controlling expressions actually change during execution (or are compiled to constants), and the basic type/macros are needed to interpret the comparisons and the do { } while (1) infinite-loop exception under MISRA."
