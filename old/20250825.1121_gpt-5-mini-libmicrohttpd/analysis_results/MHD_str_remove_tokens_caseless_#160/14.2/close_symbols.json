The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether this target function violates the MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must inspect any for loops that execute as part of this function's behaviour. The behaviour of loop bodies includes the behaviour of any functions called from those bodies, so every called symbol that could contain for loops or cause side effects relevant to loop counters must be examined.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: Called several times inside the while/do loops to compare substrings. Its implementation may contain for loops (or other loops) with loop counters and side effects; you must inspect it to ensure any for loops there are well\u2011formed and that they do not modify objects that are used/modified by the surrounding loops.\n\n- memmove: Called inside the loop to copy remaining bytes. The library implementation may use for loops; inspect it to ensure those loops are well\u2011formed and do not introduce side effects that would violate the rule when called from this function (e.g. modification of objects used as loop counters in enclosing code).\n\n- memchr: Called (via mhd_assert) at function start to check tokens. Its implementation may contain loops; inspect to ensure any for loops are well\u2011formed and have no side effects relevant to this function's loop counters or objects modified in the function.\n\n- mhd_assert: Likely a macro/wrapper used for runtime checks. Its expansion can call other functions or contain control flow; inspect its definition to ensure it does not introduce for loops that violate the rule or produce side effects affecting loop counters in the surrounding code.\n\n(There are no other external/global objects referenced by this function. Basic typedefs like size_t/bool and local variables are defined in the function; they do not require additional symbol inspection for the MISRA for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness check.)"
