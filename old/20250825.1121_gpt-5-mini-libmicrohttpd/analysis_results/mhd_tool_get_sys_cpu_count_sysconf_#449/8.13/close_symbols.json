  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C rule analysis (pointer-to-const):\n\n- sysconf\n  - The function calls sysconf. To check for pointer-to-const violations we must know sysconf's declaration/signature: whether it is a function taking an int and returning long or if it is a macro/wrapper that could involve pointer parameters or return types. If sysconf is implemented as/expanded to something that uses pointers, that could create pointer constness issues.\n\n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN\n  - This macro is passed (indirectly, via preprocessor guards) to sysconf. We need its definition/type to ensure it is an integer constant (no hidden pointer usage) and to confirm that using it does not introduce pointer operations that would trigger the MISRA rule.\n\n- _SC_NPROC_ONLN\n  - Same reason as _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN: confirm it is an integer constant and not a macro that expands to pointer-using code.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF\n  - This preprocessor symbol controls whether the sysconf-based block is compiled. To determine whether any pointer-related code from that block is relevant, we must know whether this macro is defined in the build configuration.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN\n  - This guard controls use of the _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN path. Its definition affects which code is compiled; knowing it prevents false positives/negatives when checking for pointer usage.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN\n  - Same as above for _SC_NPROC_ONLN.\n\n- <unistd.h> (sysconf prototype/header)\n  - The header that declares sysconf can show whether sysconf is declared as a normal function (long sysconf(int)) or as a macro/inline wrapper that might use pointers. The header can also reveal platform-specific definitions that matter for pointer constness.\n\n- sysconf implementation/declaration (possible macro wrapper)\n  - On some platforms sysconf may be a macro that expands to a call involving other symbols (possibly pointers). Inspecting the actual implementation or declaration ensures there are no hidden pointer parameters or pointer-returning behavior that could violate the MISRA pointer-to-const rule.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no pointer variables or pointer operations. The above symbols are required only to confirm that none of the called/used macros or functions introduce pointer usage that would be subject to the MISRA pointer-to-const rule."
