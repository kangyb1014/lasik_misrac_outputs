  "explanation": "Given the provided macro definitions (HAVE_SYSCONF and HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN defined, HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN not defined), the preprocessor yields the following facts: the sysconf-based block is included and the alternative _SC_NPROC_ONLN branch is removed at compile time, so there is no dead code due to conditional compilation in this translation unit. Within the included code, no statement is provably unreachable: value is initialized to -1 and then assigned from sysconf, so subsequent checks and returns (return -1 on error, setting ret, overflow check, final return) can all be reached depending on the runtime result of sysconf. Although the test if (0 >= value) immediately before the first sysconf() is always true given the preceding initialization, that does not introduce unreachable statements (only an always-true condition), and no code path in this function is statically impossible to execute. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
