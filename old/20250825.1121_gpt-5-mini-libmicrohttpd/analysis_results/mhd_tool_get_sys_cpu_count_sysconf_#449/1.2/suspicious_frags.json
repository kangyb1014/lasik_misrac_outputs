  "explanation": "I inspected the function and related macros for any compiler-specific language extensions (per the compilers' documentation) such as: __attribute__, __asm__ / asm, typeof / __typeof__, __extension__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, anonymous lvalues, or other vendor-specific keywords or constructs. None of those appear in the code. The code only uses standard C constructs: static function, int/long types, casts, preprocessor conditionals (#if/#ifdef/#endif with line continuation), calls to sysconf, and ordinary comments. The preprocessor symbols and system constants (_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN, macros like HAVE_SYSCONF, HAS_DECL_...) are platform/configuration macros, not compiler language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used). If you want, I can also check for other MISRA rules (reserved identifiers, implicit conversions, etc.), but those are outside Rule 1.2 as requested."
