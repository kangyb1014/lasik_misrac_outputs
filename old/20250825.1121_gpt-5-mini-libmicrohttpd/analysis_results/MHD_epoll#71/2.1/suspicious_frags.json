  "explanation": "I flagged fragments that can create unreachable-code concerns for further investigation: the MHD_PANIC macro contains BUILTIN_NOT_REACHED (a non-returning indication) and is invoked in multiple places inside MHD_epoll \u2014 any code following such non-returning calls in the same control-flow path should be checked for actual reachability. The switch default with mhd_assert(0) (where mhd_assert is a no-op macro) and the explicit \"if (1) { ... }\" pseudo-branch are constant-condition constructs that can hide unreachable alternative paths and thus deserve review. The event-loop checks that continue on NULL data.ptr and the comparisons to the static marker(s) (epoll_itc_marker) are control-flow points that may lead to skipped code; the MHD_itc_clear_ macro also contains a raw read that affects control flow and could influence reachability. Other code fragments in the function and supplied definitions were not listed because they do not contain obvious constant-false/constant-true conditions, unconditional returns followed by statements, or non-returning constructs that would statically render subsequent statements unreachable. In particular, normal returns, conditional epoll_wait loops, continue/break usage inside event-processing loops, and code guarded by #ifdef/#endif were reviewed and are standard control-flow patterns (they do not by themselves constitute statically unreachable code). If you want, I can narrow each suspicious fragment to exact line numbers or expand the context for each occurrence."
