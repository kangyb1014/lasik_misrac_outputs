  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The code does not assign to any formal parameter (there are no statements like connection = ..., realm = ..., opaque = ..., domain = ..., response = ..., signal_stale = ..., mqop = ..., malgo3 = ..., userhash_support = ..., or prefer_utf8 = ...). Pointer parameters (connection, realm, opaque, domain, response) are only passed to queue_auth_required_response3_inner; passing a pointer parameter to another function does not itself reassign the parameter. The only pointers modified are buf_ptr and da, but both are local variables (buf_ptr is initialized to NULL and later passed by address to the inner function; da is a local struct initialized/deinitialized locally). Modifying the objects pointed to by pointer parameters would be permitted by the rule, and no such direct modification occurs here. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
