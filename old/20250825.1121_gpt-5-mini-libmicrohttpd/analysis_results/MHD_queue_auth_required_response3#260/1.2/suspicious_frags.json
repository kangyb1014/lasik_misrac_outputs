  "explanation": "I flagged only the function declaration header that begins with the macro _MHD_EXTERN. That token is the only item in the snippet that commonly expands to compiler-specific linkage/visibility attributes (for example __declspec(...) or __attribute__((...))) which are explicitly documented as compiler extensions. All other code in the body uses standard C constructs: enum and struct types, pointer and const qualifiers, function calls, NULL, free, local automatic variables, and ordinary control/return statements. There are no other visible compiler-specific constructs (no __attribute__, __declspec, inline asm, statement-expressions, typeof, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords) in the provided fragment, so they do not need to be investigated for MISRA C Rule 1.2 based on the shown code."
