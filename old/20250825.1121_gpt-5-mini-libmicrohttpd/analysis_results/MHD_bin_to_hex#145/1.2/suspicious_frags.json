  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs: size_t (standard in <stddef.h>), uint8_t (standard in <stdint.h>), pointer casts, explicit casts to char, the ternary operator, bitwise shifts and masks, indexed array access, and a standard for-loop and return. There are no compiler-specific or implementation-specific extensions present (no identifiers beginning with __ or (double) underscores, no __attribute__, no asm/inline assembly, no typeof, no statement expressions, no GCC/Clang pragmas or builtins, no Microsoft-specific keywords, nor any other documented compiler extension). Therefore there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
