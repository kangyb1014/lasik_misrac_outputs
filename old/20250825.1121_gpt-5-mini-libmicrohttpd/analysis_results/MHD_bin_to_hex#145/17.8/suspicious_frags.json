  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The parameters are: (1) bin \u2014 only read via a cast to 'const uint8_t *' and indexed; the pointer variable 'bin' is not assigned to or incremented, and the pointee is treated as const so it is not modified; (2) size \u2014 only read as the loop bound and not assigned to; (3) hex \u2014 used via indexing (hex[i * 2]) to modify the object it points to, which is permitted by the rule (the pointer itself is not modified). There are no assignments such as 'bin = ...', 'hex = ...', nor operations like 'hex++' that would modify the pointer parameters. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
