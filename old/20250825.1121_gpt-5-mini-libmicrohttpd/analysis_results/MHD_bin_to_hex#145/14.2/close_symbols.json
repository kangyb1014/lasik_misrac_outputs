The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide MISRA well-formed for-loop compliance:\n\n- size: The second clause of the for (i < size) uses this parameter. You must confirm that 'size' is not modified anywhere in the loop body (or by any functions called from the loop body). If 'size' were modified in the loop body it would violate the rule.\n\n- bin: The loop reads from ((const uint8_t *)bin)[i]. You must confirm that indexing/reads from 'bin' do not cause side effects that modify the loop counter or the value of 'size'. Also confirm 'bin' is const (not modified) so it cannot be the hidden target of side effects that break the rule.\n\n- hex: The loop writes to hex[i*2] and hex[i*2+1]. The rule forbids the second clause from using objects that are modified in the loop body; you must verify the second clause does not reference 'hex' (it does not) and that writes through 'hex' cannot indirectly modify the loop counter or 'size' (e.g. via aliasing to those objects).\n\n- i: The loop counter declared as size_t i. You must verify that 'i' is the single loop counter, that it is initialized in the first clause (i = 0), that it is the only object modified by the third clause (++i), and that the loop body (including any functions called) does not modify 'i'.\n\n- j, b: Local temporaries used inside the loop body. They are modified in the body (which is allowed) but you must confirm they are not loop counters and do not alias or otherwise modify 'i' or 'size'.\n\n- size_t: Definition/typedef of size_t is needed to confirm the loop counter's type (integer type) and semantics of ++i and comparisons, and to reason about type conversion/overflow behavior if relevant.\n\n- uint8_t: Definition/typedef of uint8_t is needed to confirm semantics of b and j, and to ensure their operations do not have hidden side effects affecting the loop control.\n\nNo functions are called inside the loop body; therefore no additional callee function symbols are required. The above symbols are sufficient to determine whether the three clauses use or modify only the allowed objects and whether the loop counter is the single object controlling the loop, per the MISRA rule."
