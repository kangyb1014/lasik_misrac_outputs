The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C \"for loop shall be well-formed\" rule in this function we must be sure no expressions here (or expansions used by them) introduce for-loops or side-effecting behaviour that would violate the rule. Explanations:\n\n- tool_params (definition/type and full declaration): determine whether 'tool_params' is a plain global struct/object or a macro/inline accessor. If it is a macro or an accessor function, its expansion/body could contain for-loops or side effects relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\n- tool_params.empty, tool_params.tiny, tool_params.medium, tool_params.large (declaration/definition): verify these members are plain scalar/boolean fields (no overloaded macros) and have no hidden side effects when read or written. The MISRA rule forbids loop-control expressions that have persistent side effects; we must ensure these member accesses/assignment do not expand to code with side effects or loops.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result (full enum definition) and PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: ensure these return values are simple enum/constant identifiers and not macros or inline functions that expand to statements (which could contain loops). If they are macros that expand to function calls or complex expressions, that could affect compliance.\n\n- fprintf (declaration or any macro wrapper in project headers) and stderr (declaration or any macro/wrapper): the function calls in this routine are fprintf(stderr, ...). Confirm that in the project these are the standard declarations or at most thin wrappers; if either is a macro or wrapper that expands to code containing a for-loop (or other side effects), that would be relevant because the MISRA rule counts behaviour of called functions within the loop statement. Even though this function does not contain a for loop, if any symbol used here expands to code with for-loops it matters for analysis of surrounding code and for confirming no implicit loops are present.\n\n- Any preprocessor macros or inline wrapper functions that redefine the above symbols (project headers): explicitly request the preprocessor definitions so you can see actual expansions. Macros could hide loops/side effects; to be conservative, the analyzer needs the real expansions of the identifiers used in this function.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no for-loop. The symbols above are needed only to verify that none of the referenced identifiers expand to or call code that would introduce for-loops or side effects relevant to the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule."
