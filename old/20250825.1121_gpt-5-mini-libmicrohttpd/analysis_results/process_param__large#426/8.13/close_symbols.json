  "explanation": "To determine whether the pointer parameter should be const-qualified (MISRA: pointer should point to const whenever possible) we must not only check the target function body (which already uses 'const char *param_name') but also how that pointer is produced and used elsewhere. The listed symbols are required for these checks:\n\n- process_short_param (definition/prototype): This caller passes the argument to process_param__large. Inspecting its prototype and implementation shows what type it passes (char * vs const char *) and whether it expects the callee to modify the pointed data.\n\n- process_long_param (definition/prototype): Same reason as above for the other direct caller.\n\n- process_short_params_str (definition / call site of process_short_param): This is the caller of process_short_param (per the call graph). You need to follow the argument origin chain to see whether the pointer originates from a mutable buffer or a string literal and whether any caller expects modification.\n\n- process_params (definition / call site of process_long_param): Same as above for the long-parameter path; inspect how param_name is supplied.\n\n- definitions/prototypes of the functions that construct or supply the param_name argument (e.g. where argv/options are parsed and the pointer passed down): To decide whether it was possible (and safe) to declare the parameter const, you must know whether the pointer points into a mutable buffer that other code expects to be modified, or to immutable data (string literal, const storage). If callers create or pass pointers into mutable buffers and expect modification by callees, making the parameter const could be inappropriate.\n\n- definition of struct/variable tool_params (type and members empty,tiny,medium,large): While not directly related to const-qualification of param_name, the structure is modified in this function (tool_params.large = !0) and its layout/types may reveal any aliasing or pointer relations in the same translation unit that could affect whether param_name might be modified indirectly. Also useful to ensure no unexpected pointer members or casts elsewhere.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result and the constants PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: These are required to fully understand the return semantics of the function (not pointer-related directly) and to ensure no hidden pointer-return behavior or conventions that would influence whether param_name must be non-const.\n\nIn short: to validate the MISRA rule here you must (a) confirm the target function itself does not modify *param_name (it does not), and (b) inspect callers and the origin of the pointer to ensure callers expect modifiable storage or perform casts that would make a const parameter inappropriate. The symbols above give the necessary call-chain and context to perform that analysis."
