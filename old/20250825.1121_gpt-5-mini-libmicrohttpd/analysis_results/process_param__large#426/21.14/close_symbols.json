  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule being checked explicitly concerns the use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. To determine whether this target function violates the rule you must know if memcmp is invoked directly in this function (or indirectly via a macro or wrapper). Include the memcmp symbol (and any macro wrappers) so the analyzer can detect any use or expansion of memcmp in the function body.\n\n- tool_params (definition/type) - fields: empty, tiny, medium, large: The function reads and writes members of tool_params. Those members could be implemented as macros, accessor functions, or have side effects that call memcmp (or expand to code that does). The concrete definition (the struct/union and any macros) is needed to ensure that checking/setting these fields does not hide a memcmp-based string comparison.\n\n- fprintf: The function calls fprintf. Although not directly related to memcmp, the analyzer must know whether fprintf is a plain standard library function or a macro/wrapper that might expand into code that uses memcmp. Provide the symbol to rule out such indirect memcmp usage.\n\n- stderr: Provided because it is an argument to fprintf; include it to allow full resolution of fprintf usage and to check for unusual macro redefinitions that could introduce memcmp usage.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result and enumerators: PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR, PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: The function returns these values. Their definitions must be known to ensure they are ordinary enum constants (and not macros or inline functions that could hide memcmp usage). This is mostly to fully resolve all symbols referenced by the function when checking for hidden memcmp uses.\n\n- process_short_param (caller) - prototype/definition: The callers can show how param_name is constructed or passed. To determine whether param_name is a conventional null-terminated C string (which is relevant to the MISRA rule) you need to inspect the callers' code. Also callers might wrap/forward parameters through functions that use memcmp; include them so the analysis can check for indirect memcmp usage related to this parameter.\n\n- process_long_param (caller) - prototype/definition: Same rationale as for process_short_param \u2014 inspect how param_name is created/passed and whether any indirect memcmp-based comparisons occur in the call chain.\n\nSummary: The listed symbols let an analyzer (1) detect any direct use of memcmp in the function, (2) rule out memcmp hidden in macros/wrappers used by the function (tool_params access, fprintf/stderr), and (3) inspect callers to determine whether param_name is a conventional null-terminated string or whether memcmp-based comparisons occur elsewhere in the call chain affecting this logic."
