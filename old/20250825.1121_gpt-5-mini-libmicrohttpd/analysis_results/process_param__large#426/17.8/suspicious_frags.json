  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in process_param__large. The parameter is declared as const char *param_name and is only read (used in fprintf and indexed as param_name[1]). There is no assignment to param_name itself and no write to *param_name, so the pointer and the pointed-to object are not being modified. The assignment tool_params.large = !0 modifies a global object, not a function parameter, and therefore is not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
