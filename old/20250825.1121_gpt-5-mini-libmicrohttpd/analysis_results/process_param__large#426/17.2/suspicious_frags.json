  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function process_param__large contains no calls to itself and makes no calls to other user-defined functions that could call it back: the only function invoked is the standard library fprintf, which does not call user callbacks and cannot cause indirect recursion to this static function. There are no function-pointer dereferences, callbacks, or other constructs (setjmp/longjmp, thread entry points, etc.) inside the function that could produce indirect invocation. All other statements are simple condition checks, assignments to tool_params fields, and a conditional return expression; none introduce direct or indirect recursive calls, so no fragments require further investigation for Rule 17.2."
