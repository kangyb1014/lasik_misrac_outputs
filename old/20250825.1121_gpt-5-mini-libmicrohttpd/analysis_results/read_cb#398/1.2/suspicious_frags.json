  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code does not use compiler-specific constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions, __builtin_*, __extension__, or other vendor-specific keywords/extension syntaxes that are explicitly documented as language extensions. The identifiers and functions in the fragment are standard C (malloc, free, fread, ferror, memcpy) or from standard headers (uint64_t from <stdint.h>, size_t from <stddef.h>/<stdio.h>), or from external libraries (z_stream from zlib) \u2014 none are compiler language extensions per se. The POSIX type ssize_t appears in the signature; ssize_t is a POSIX type rather than a compiler language-extension token. If the target compiler explicitly documents ssize_t (or any other used symbol) as a compiler language extension for the build environment in question, that platform-specific detail should be checked by reviewers \u2014 otherwise it is not a language extension covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 and therefore not flagged here."
