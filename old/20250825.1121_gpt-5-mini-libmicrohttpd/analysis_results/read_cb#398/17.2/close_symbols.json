  "explanation": "To decide whether read_cb participates in a recursion cycle (direct or indirect) you must inspect every call edge out of read_cb and follow them transitively. read_cb calls compress_buf, so the compress_buf definition/prototype is required to see whether it calls read_cb (directly) or calls other functions that eventually call read_cb (indirect recursion). The Holder definition is required because read_cb passes holder->stream and holder->buf into compress_buf; those members may contain callbacks/function pointers or types that cause indirect calls back to read_cb. Therefore the concrete type of Holder::stream and Holder::buf and any function-pointer targets they reference must be examined. Finally, to complete the transitive call-graph check you need the definitions of all functions called (directly or indirectly) by compress_buf and any global function-pointer variables it uses, so you can detect any path from compress_buf back to read_cb. Without these symbols you cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of indirect recursion."
