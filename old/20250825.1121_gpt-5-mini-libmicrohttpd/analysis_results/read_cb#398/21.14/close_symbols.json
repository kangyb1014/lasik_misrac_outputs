  "explanation": "compress_buf (definition/implementation): The target does not call memcmp itself but forwards buffers to compress_buf. To decide whether memcmp is used to compare NUL-terminated strings you must inspect compress_buf\u2019s body (and its internal calls) to see if it calls memcmp and how it constructs/passes arguments (buffers and lengths).\n\nstruct Holder (definition: fields file, stream, buf): The holder fields passed into read_cb (holder->stream and holder->buf) are forwarded to compress_buf. Understanding the types and semantics of these fields is required to determine whether the buffers passed to memcmp are intended/treated as NUL-terminated strings.\n\ntype/definition of holder->stream: The stream object is passed into compress_buf and may influence how buffers are produced (for example, whether they are text strings terminated with '\\0'). Knowing this type and its semantics is necessary to judge whether a memcmp call would be comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n\ntype/definition and semantics of holder->buf: compress_buf receives holder->buf; it may be used as an input or output buffer or as a string. You must know whether holder->buf points to NUL-terminated strings or binary buffers to assess compliance with the MISRA rule.\n\nmemcmp (standard library symbol/prototype): If compress_buf (or its callees) uses memcmp, you need the memcmp prototype/usages to see what arguments are passed (pointers and lengths) and whether the code compares NUL-terminated strings via memcmp instead of a string function.\n\nany transitive callees of compress_buf (their definitions): If compress_buf calls other functions, those may be where memcmp is used. To be certain no prohibited memcmp-on-string occurs you must inspect all transitive callees.\n\nThese symbols together let the analyst determine whether any memcmp call exists in the call chain and whether it is ever used to compare NUL-terminated strings (MISRA violation)."
