  "scenario": "The call memcpy(mem, buf, size) can copy more bytes than the buffer pointed to by mem (and can also read beyond buf) because compress_buf is passed &size and may modify size independently of the actual capacity of mem. If compress_buf increases size (e.g. compression expands data) or returns a buf shorter than size, memcpy will access out-of-bounds memory. Therefore the use of memcpy can result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by its pointer parameters."
