  "explanation": "1) compress_buf: Need the prototype and (preferably) the implementation to determine whether it writes through the pointer passed as &size. In read_cb, the parameter 'size' (a value parameter) is passed by address to compress_buf; if compress_buf assigns to that pointer (or its parameter is non-const size_t * and it stores into *size) then read_cb\u2019s parameter 'size' is being modified indirectly \u2014 this is the central possible MISRA violation. The callee\u2019s signature (types, const-qualification) and body are required to decide this.\n\n2) struct Holder: Need the definition of struct Holder to confirm types of holder->stream, holder->file and holder->buf and to verify how they are passed to compress_buf. This helps (a) ensure the compress_buf parameters line up with the arguments passed (so the size argument corresponds to the compress_buf parameter that could be written), and (b) confirm that modifications to the object pointed to by cls (i.e. *holder) are only modifications of the pointee (which MISRA allows) rather than assignments to the parameter 'cls' itself."
