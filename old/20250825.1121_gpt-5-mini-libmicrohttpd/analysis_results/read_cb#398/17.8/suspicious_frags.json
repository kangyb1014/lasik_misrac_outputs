  "explanation": "The only parameter of read_cb that is modified is the scalar parameter 'size' (it is passed by address to compress_buf via '&size', so its value is changed indirectly). Other read_cb parameters are not assigned to or re-pointed: 'cls' is only read and cast to 'struct Holder *', 'pos' is only read and converted to 'offset', and 'mem' is only used as the destination for memcpy (the mem pointer itself is not modified). In compress_buf, the modifications shown are to the objects pointed-to by pointer parameters (*dest, *dest_size, *offset), which is permitted by the rule; compress_buf does not reassign the pointer parameters themselves. No other assignments to the value of any non-pointer function parameters occur in the provided code, so no additional fragments need investigation."
