  "explanation": "For applying the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointer targets you must know which pointers are actually mutated or consumed as mutable. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- struct Holder (definition): read_cb casts cls to struct Holder * and accesses holder->file, holder->stream and holder->buf. You must know the exact types and existing const-qualifiers of these members (e.g. FILE *, stream type, buffer pointer) to determine whether cls could be declared as const void * or struct Holder const *, and whether passing member addresses requires non-const. The holder member types also determine whether member pointers themselves could/should be const.\n\n- compress_buf (prototype / declaration): read_cb calls compress_buf(&holder->stream, src, r_size, &offset, &buf, &size, holder->buf). You need its parameter types and const qualifiers (in particular for the stream parameter, the src parameter and the buf/holder->buf parameters) to know whether compress_buf modifies those objects. If compress_buf does not modify src it could accept a const void *; if it modifies stream it requires a non-const stream pointer\u2014this directly affects whether holder (and cls) may be const and whether src/buf could be const.\n\n- fread (prototype): prototype (size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)) indicates that src is passed as the destination buffer and thus must be a writable (non-const) pointer. This prevents making src a const-qualified pointer in read_cb.\n\n- ferror (prototype): prototype (int ferror(FILE *stream)) shows that holder->file is passed to ferror as a FILE *; understanding whether file I/O mutates the FILE object (it does) impacts whether holder (or its file member) can be const.\n\n- memcpy (prototype): prototype (void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n)) shows that the second argument may be a const source. This is relevant for buf: memcpy(mem, buf, size) would accept buf as const void *, but other uses (e.g. freeing buf) matter too.\n\n- free (prototype): prototype (void free(void *ptr)) requires a non-const pointer argument; read_cb calls free(buf). If buf were considered const, passing it to free would require a cast (and would violate the const-correctness rule). Knowing free's signature is needed to decide whether buf can/should be declared const.\n\n- malloc (prototype): prototype (void *malloc(size_t)) shows malloc returns a writable buffer for src. This confirms src must be non-const at allocation and for passing to fread.\n\nCollectively these symbols let the analyzer determine which pointers are actually modified (or must be non-const because of called APIs) versus which are only read and therefore could be declared to point to const-qualified types."
