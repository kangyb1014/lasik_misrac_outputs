Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified when possible, so buf should be declared as const void * (and the API that produces it adjusted if necessary). As written, buf is not const-qualified even though it is only read here, so the rule is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Although buf is only read from by memcpy, it is (a) passed to free(buf) later and (b) is produced/assigned by compress_buf via a void ** output parameter. Declaring buf as const void * would be impractical here: compress_buf\u2019s API (void **) and free(void *) both require a non-const pointer or would force qualifier-discarding casts. Because buf must be a modifiable void * to interoperate with those APIs, it is not \u201cpossible\u201d to make it point to a const-qualified type in this context, so Rule 8.13 is not violated."
