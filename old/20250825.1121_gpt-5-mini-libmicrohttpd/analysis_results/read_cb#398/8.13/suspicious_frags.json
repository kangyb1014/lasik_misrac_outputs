  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation with regard to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not expose pointer-to-non-const issues or are clearly using mutable objects. Examples: the pos/offset/size/r_size/ret declarations and arithmetic (including the cast offset = (size_t) pos), the SSIZE_MAX check and early returns, the allocation/free of src and use of fread to write into src (the buffer is intentionally mutable), the error handling / goto done sequence, and the final free(src) and return ret. These parts either operate on non-pointer scalar types or explicitly require mutable buffers (malloc/fread/memcpy), so they are not candidates for adding const qualification under Rule 8.13."
