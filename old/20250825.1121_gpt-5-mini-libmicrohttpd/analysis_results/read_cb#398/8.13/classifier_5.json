  "scenario": "The buf pointer is used to hold an allocated buffer returned/owned by compress_buf and is later passed to free(buf). Because the buffer is owned and must be freed (and may have been created/modified by compress_buf), buf must be a pointer to a modifiable object (void *). Declaring it as const void * would force casts to call free, or require removing the const qualifier, both of which are undesirable. Therefore Rule 8.13 does not apply here and is not violated."
