Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of read_cb:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nread_cb (void *cls, uint64_t pos, char *mem, size_t size)\n{\n  struct Holder *holder = cls;\n  void *src;\n  void *buf;\n  ssize_t ret;\n  size_t offset;\n  size_t r_size;\n\n  if (pos > SSIZE_MAX)\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  offset = (size_t) pos;\n  src = malloc (size);\n  if (NULL == src)\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  r_size = fread (src, 1, size, holder->file);\n  if (0 == r_size)\n  {\n    ret = (0 != ferror (holder->file)) ?\n          MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR : MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM;\n    goto done;\n  }\n  if (MHD_YES != compress_buf (&holder->stream, src, r_size, &offset, &buf,\n                               &size, holder->buf))\n    ret = MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR;\n  else\n  {\n    memcpy (mem, buf, size);\n    ret = (ssize_t) size;\n  }\n  free (buf); /* Buf may be set even on error return. */\ndone:\n  free (src);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function read_cb:\nstruct Holder\n{\n  FILE *file;\n  z_stream stream;\n  void *buf;\n}\n...\n#define MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR ((ssize_t)-2)\n...\n#define MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM ((ssize_t)-1)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfree (buf); /* Buf may be set even on error return. */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "free(buf) is executed on the paths where r_size != 0 (after compress_buf is called) to release memory that compress_buf may have allocated. Removing that free would change program behaviour (memory would leak and could eventually affect the program), so the operation is not dead code. (Note: there is a separate safety concern if compress_buf can return an error without setting buf \u2014 calling free on an indeterminate pointer would be undefined behaviour and must be fixed, but that is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.)"
