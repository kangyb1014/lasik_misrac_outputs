  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is needed to decide whether any controlling expression in read_cb is an invariant (always true or always false) under the MISRA rule:\n\n- compress_buf: read_cb uses the return value of compress_buf in the condition (MHD_YES != compress_buf(...)). To determine if that controlling expression is invariant you must know compress_buf's prototype and semantics/possible return values (does it ever return other than MHD_YES?).\n\n- MHD_YES: This macro/enum is the value compared against compress_buf()'s return. Its definition and domain are required to interpret the comparison and to know whether the comparison can evaluate both true and false.\n\n- struct Holder: The function reads holder->file, holder->stream and holder->buf. The definitions (types and any invariants/constraints) of these members are required to reason about effects of fread and compress_buf and whether conditions involving their results can vary.\n\n- holder->file (type/semantics): More specifically, the type and properties of holder->file (typically FILE *) and how it is used/initialized are needed to assess whether fread(holder->file, ...) can legitimately return 0 or non-zero (i.e. whether the 0 == r_size test can be both true and false).\n\n- fread: The semantics and possible return values of fread are required to determine whether r_size (and thus the test 0 == r_size) is potentially variable or effectively constant for the given file source.\n\n- ferror: The semantics of ferror (including when it can be non-zero) are required to interpret the ternary used when r_size == 0 and to know whether that branch's controlling expression can vary.\n\n- SSIZE_MAX: The constant used in the expression (pos > SSIZE_MAX) must be known (value and type) to determine whether the comparison can be both true and false for the incoming pos (uint64_t) values\u2014i.e. whether the controlling expression is potentially invariant.\n\n- malloc: The allocation result is checked (NULL == src). Knowing malloc's behavior (when it may return NULL for the given size) is necessary to decide whether that NULL-check can be both true and false or is effectively invariant in the analyzed context.\n\n(Other symbols appearing only as return constants such as MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR or MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM do not affect whether controlling expressions are invariant, so they are not strictly required for this MISRA rule analysis.)"
