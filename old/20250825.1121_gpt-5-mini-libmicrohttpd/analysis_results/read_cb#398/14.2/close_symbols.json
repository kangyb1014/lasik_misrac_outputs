Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed:\n\n- compress_buf (full definition/ prototype)\n  - The for-loop well-formedness rule applies to the behaviour of functions called inside a loop and, symmetrically, the body of a function call is part of the behaviour of any for loop that contains that call. Even though read_cb contains no for loops, compress_buf is called from read_cb and may itself contain for loops. To determine whether any for loop in compress_buf violates the MISRA requirements (e.g. uses/changes loop counters, uses objects in the loop-clause that are modified in the loop body, or modifies objects that are used in its own for-clause) you must inspect the full implementation and its for statements.\n\n- struct Holder (complete definition)\n  - read_cb passes holder->stream and holder->buf to compress_buf and reads from holder->file. To reason about whether compress_buf's for loops illegally use or modify objects that are (also) modified in read_cb or in the loop body, you need the exact member types and whether they are aliases/shared objects. For example, if holder->buf is an object that compress_buf both reads in the loop-clause and modifies in the loop body, that could violate the rule.\n\n- type/definition of Holder::stream\n  - compress_buf is called with &holder->stream; if compress_buf contains for loops that reference fields of the stream in loop clauses (or use the stream as the loop counter or flag) and also modify the stream inside the loop body, that can create a MISRA violation. The stream type definition lets you see which subobjects could be used/modified by compress_buf.\n\n- type/definition of Holder::buf\n  - holder->buf is passed into compress_buf; if compress_buf's for-clause uses this object (or an alias) while also modifying it in the loop body, that would violate clause (2). Knowing the exact type lets you detect aliasing and whether compress_buf might legally modify it.\n\n- compress_buf parameter declarations (which params are pointers/outputs \u2014 in particular offset, buf and size)\n  - read_cb passes &offset, &buf, &size to compress_buf. If compress_buf's for loops use the dereferenced offset/size/ buf in their loop clauses and also modify them in the loop body (or modify other objects used in the clause), that can be a violation. The parameter signatures tell you whether compress_buf may legally modify those objects (pointer vs value) and whether aliasing is possible.\n\n- MHD_YES, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR, MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM\n  - These macros/constants are not directly about for-loop structure, but knowing their definitions can clarify control-flow and error paths in read_cb and compress_buf, which matters when determining whether objects passed to compress_buf might be modified on all paths (relevant when checking whether a for-clause uses objects that are modified in the loop body). They are inexpensive to include and can affect conditional compilation and return-value interpretations used in loop control.\n\nNotes:\n- The standard-library functions used in read_cb (malloc, free, fread, memcpy, ferror) are unlikely targets for MISRA for-loop violations within the project's source; if you need to be exhaustive you would inspect their implementations, but typically MISRA checks focus on project code (compress_buf and other user-defined functions). The static call graph shows compress_buf has no further callees, so retrieving compress_buf's implementation plus Holder and the member types is sufficient to determine if any for loop reachable from read_cb is well-formed."
