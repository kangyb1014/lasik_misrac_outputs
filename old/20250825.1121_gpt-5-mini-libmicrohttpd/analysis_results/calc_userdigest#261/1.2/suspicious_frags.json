  "explanation": "The remainder of the function body and the other symbols shown (digest_update, digest_update_with_colon, digest_update_str, digest_calc_hash, mhd_assert definition, use of uint8_t and size_t, and the function parameter list) use standard C constructs or simple macros that do not introduce compiler-specific language extensions. The only occurrences of compiler-specific extension syntax in the provided code are the macro that expands to an attribute and the attribute token itself; no other __attribute__ or other documented compiler extensions are present in the supplied code fragments. Therefore other parts do not need investigation under Rule 1.2."
