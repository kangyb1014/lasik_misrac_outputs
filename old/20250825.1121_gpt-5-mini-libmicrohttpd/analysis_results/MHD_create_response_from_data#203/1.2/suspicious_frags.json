  "explanation": "The only token in this snippet that may hide a compiler-specific language extension is the macro-like prefix _MHD_EXTERN (appears exactly as shown). It could expand to compiler-specific storage-class/visibility attributes (for example __declspec, __attribute__((...)), or other implementation-specific keywords) and therefore should be investigated. All other constructs in the fragment are standard C: function definition syntax, use of size_t, void*, int parameters, enum declaration and enumeration constants, if/else statements, and the function call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer \u2014 none of which are themselves compiler-specific extensions in the shown code."
