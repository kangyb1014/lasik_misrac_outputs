  "explanation": "The MISRA rule in question concerns pointer parameters that could be const-qualified. In this function the only pointer present is the \u2018\u2018data\u2019\u2019 parameter and its use in the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer; those are the only locations that could require investigation. Other fragments (the enum variable mode and its assignments, the integer flags must_free/must_copy, and the function return type) do not involve pointer-to-data declarations or pointer usage that could be const-qualified, and there are no other pointer variables in the function to inspect."
