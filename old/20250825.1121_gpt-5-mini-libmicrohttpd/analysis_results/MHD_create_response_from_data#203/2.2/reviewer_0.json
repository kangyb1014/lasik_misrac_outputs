If the member r->data_buffer_size is never subsequently read anywhere in the project, then removing this assignment would not change program behaviour, so the operation is dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is not a definitive demonstration that the code violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2. The scenario describes a reachable assignment (r->data_buffer_size = size) that could be dead code if\u2014and only if\u2014no other code in the entire project ever reads that field or otherwise depends on it. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids dead code in the project, but proving a violation requires whole\u2011project evidence that the assignment\u2019s removal would not alter behaviour. The inline TODO suggests the field may be redundant, but that comment alone does not prove the field is unused. Therefore the claim as stated is only a possible/conditional violation, not a proven one.\n\nRecommended action: perform project\u2011wide data\u2011flow analysis (or a manual code search) to determine whether r->data_buffer_size is ever read or relied upon (including by external modules, callbacks, tests, or debugging hooks). If it is never read and there are no observable side effects from writing it, the assignment is indeed dead and should be removed (or documented why it must remain). If it is read, the assignment is required and there is no Rule 2.2 violation."
