  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning: (1) The conditional chain (if (0 != must_copy) / else if (0 != must_free) / else ...) is not statically constant \u2014 each branch is reachable depending on the runtime values of the parameters, so none of those branches is inherently unreachable. (2) There is no code after the final return, no unreachable labels, and no switch/case fall-throughs or constant conditions present in the submitted snippets. (3) The enum definitions are ordinary symbol declarations and do not introduce unreachable code. (4) The stray 'int must_free' shown in the additional snippet appears to be an incomplete or separate declaration (not code that would be unreachable within the shown function) and does not by itself create unreachable code. If any of the involved identifiers (must_copy or must_free) are replaced by compile-time constant expressions elsewhere in the project, then that could create unreachable branches \u2014 that would require examination of the broader project build and preprocessor configuration, but based on the provided code alone there is no unreachable code to investigate."
