  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasons: \n\n- All pointer parameters in the shown code are to const-qualified types: the function under inspection declares the input string as \"const char *str\" and the token as \"const char *const token\". Both point to const-qualified char data, satisfying the requirement that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible.\n\n- There are no other pointer variables (no non-const pointers to data) in the function body; local variables derived from pointers (sc, tc) are char values, not pointers, so Rule 8.13 does not apply to them.\n\n- The helper function charsequalcaseless accepts char by value (const char c1, const char c2) rather than pointers, so it is outside the scope of Rule 8.13.\n\n- Pointer arithmetic in the code (increments of str and indexing of token) only reads the pointed-to data; it does not modify the pointee, so preserving the pointed-to const qualification is appropriate and already done.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments in the provided code that appear to violate Rule 8.13."
