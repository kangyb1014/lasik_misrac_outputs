  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. MHD_str_has_token_caseless_ does not call itself and makes only direct calls to the local helper charsequalcaseless. charsequalcaseless in turn calls only the local helper isasciiupper; isasciiupper contains only simple comparisons and does not call any other functions. There are no function pointers, callbacks, macros expanding to function calls, or external library calls in the provided code that could produce indirect recursion back to MHD_str_has_token_caseless_. Therefore there is no direct or indirect self-call to investigate under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
