  "explanation": "All other controlling expressions in the function are data-dependent and therefore not invariant: - while (0 != *str) and the final while (0 != *str && ',' != *str) depend on the runtime value pointed to by str. - The whitespace-skip loops while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str || ',' == *str) and while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str) are contingent on *str at runtime. - The if conditions (0 == token_len), (0 == sc), (! charsequalcaseless (sc, tc)), and (i >= token_len) all depend on runtime variables (token_len, sc, tc, i). - The helper functions charsequalcaseless and isasciiupper perform runtime character checks, so expressions using them are not compile-time constants. No other constant/invariant controlling expressions appear in the provided code. Therefore only the listed fragment requires investigation for conformity with Rule 14.3."
