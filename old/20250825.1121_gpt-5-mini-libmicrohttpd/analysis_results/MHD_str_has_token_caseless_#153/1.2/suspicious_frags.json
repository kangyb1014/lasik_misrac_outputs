  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of compiler language extensions in the provided code fragments. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __inline__, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expression ({ ... }) or other vendor-specific keywords or pragmas in the shown code.\n- The identifiers and constructs in the code (bool, size_t, const, pointer usage, comparisons, while(1), inline-like macro usage name _MHD_static_inline) are standard C language constructs or ordinary macro identifiers as presented. The use of bool and size_t are standard types (C99 and C headers) rather than compiler extensions.\n- The macro-like prefix _MHD_static_inline appears in the additional code, but its expansion/definition was not provided. Only the macro name is present; without its definition it cannot be classified as a compiler language extension. If that macro expands to a compiler-specific extension (for example, __inline__ or compiler attributes), then the macro definition should be inspected \u2014 otherwise the code itself contains no explicit extension use.\n\nTherefore, based on the supplied code only, there are no explicit language extensions to report. If you can supply the definition of _MHD_static_inline or any compilation flags or headers that introduce nonstandard keywords, I can re-evaluate and flag any actual extensions."
