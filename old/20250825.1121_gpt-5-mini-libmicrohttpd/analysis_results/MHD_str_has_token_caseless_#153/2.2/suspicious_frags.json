  "explanation": "I have reported fragments that should be inspected for possible dead operations (executed code whose removal would not affect behaviour). These include pointer increments and post-increment reads (str++ and token[i++]), early return conditions and breaks inside the matching loop, the whitespace/comma skipping loops, and the case-handling expression in charsequalcaseless/isasciiupper \u2014 all places where an executed operation might be redundant or have no effect on overall behaviour depending on calling context or guarantees about inputs.\n\nThe remaining code was not reported because it is clearly essential to the function\u2019s control flow or return behaviour and is reachable: the outer loop condition (while (0 != *str)) controls iteration over the input string; the initial token_len == 0 check prevents invalid matching and is a functional precondition; the final return false is the correct overall result when no match is found; and comments/brace structure have no operational effect. These elements cannot be removed without changing function semantics, so they are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2."
