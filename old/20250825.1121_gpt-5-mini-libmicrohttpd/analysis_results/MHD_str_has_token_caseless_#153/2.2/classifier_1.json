The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_has_token_caseless_:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_has_token_caseless_ (const char *str,\n                             const char *const token,\n                             size_t token_len)\n{\n  if (0 == token_len)\n    return false;\n\n  while (0 != *str)\n  {\n    size_t i;\n    /* Skip all whitespaces and empty tokens. */\n    while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str || ',' == *str)\n      str++;\n\n    /* Check for token match. */\n    i = 0;\n    while (1)\n    {\n      const char sc = *(str++);\n      const char tc = token[i++];\n\n      if (0 == sc)\n        return false;\n      if (! charsequalcaseless (sc, tc))\n        break;\n      if (i >= token_len)\n      {\n        /* Check whether substring match token fully or\n         * has additional unmatched chars at tail. */\n        while (' ' == *str || '\\t' == *str)\n          str++;\n        /* End of (sub)string? */\n        if ((0 == *str) || (',' == *str) )\n          return true;\n        /* Unmatched chars at end of substring. */\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    /* Find next substring. */\n    while (0 != *str && ',' != *str)\n      str++;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_str_has_token_caseless_:\n_MHD_static_inline bool\ncharsequalcaseless (const char c1, const char c2)\n{\n  return ( (c1 == c2) ||\n           (isasciiupper (c1) ?\n            ((c1 - 'A' + 'a') == c2) :\n            ((c1 == (c2 - 'A' + 'a')) && isasciiupper (c2))) );\n}\n...\n_MHD_static_inline bool\nisasciiupper (char c)\n{\n  return (c >= 'A') && (c <= 'Z');\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nwhile (0 != *str && ',' != *str)\n      str++;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Example: str=\"abcd,ef\", token=\"ab\", token_len=2. After matching 'a' and 'b' the inner loop breaks with str pointing at 'c'; the fragment while (0 != *str && ',' != *str) str++; advances str directly to the comma, skipping the remainder of the current substring. Removing that loop would not change the logical return value of the function (it would still eventually reach the comma by repeated inner-loop iterations) but would change control-flow/timing and the number of character comparisons. Because timing and control flow can be relevant in embedded systems (see Note 1 to Rule 2.2) and because the loop materially affects how the scanning proceeds, this code is not dead code."
