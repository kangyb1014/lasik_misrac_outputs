The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they matter for checking the MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' rule in show_help:\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: This function is called from show_help. The MISRA rule requires that the behaviour of functions called inside a for loop body be considered when assessing loop well-formedness. Although show_help contains no for loops, you must confirm this function (or a macro wrapper) does not expand to or invoke behavior that would introduce or modify loop counters or objects used by any loops in this translation unit. Also verify it has no hidden side effects on globals that could be used as loop counters.\n\n- MHD_NO: The code compares the return of MHD_is_feature_supported to MHD_NO. You must confirm MHD_NO is a simple compile-time constant (enum/macro) and not a macro/function that has side effects or evaluates to expressions that could affect loop control.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL and MHD_FEATURE_POLL: These are passed as arguments to MHD_is_feature_supported. Confirm they are simple constants (enum/macro) and not macros or expressions with side effects or that expand to code altering objects used in loop control.\n\n- printf: show_help calls printf repeatedly. If a for loop were added or if macro expansions replaced calls with loop constructs, the side effects of called I/O functions could matter. Verify printf is the standard library function (no macro replacement) and does not modify objects that might serve as loop counters in surrounding code.\n\n- self_name: Global/string variable used in printf format. If any for loops in this translation unit use this object as a loop counter or control flag, its provenance and whether functions called from show_help (or macros) modify it must be known. Confirm it is a plain string pointer (no side-effecting accessor macro).\n\n- tool_copyright: Same rationale as self_name \u2014 global used by show_help; ensure it is a simple object and not a macro or accessor with side effects that could affect loop counters.\n\nNotes: show_help as given contains no for loops, so at the function level there is no direct MISRA violation. The listed symbols let the next analyzer confirm that none of the called functions/macros expand to or modify objects that would be relevant to loop counter/loop-control correctness in this translation unit (i.e., ensure there are no hidden loops or side effects affecting loop counters)."
