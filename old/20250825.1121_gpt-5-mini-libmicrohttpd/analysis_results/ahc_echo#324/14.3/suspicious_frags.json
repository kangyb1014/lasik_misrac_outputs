  "explanation": "I inspected all controlling expressions in ahc_echo and found none that are manifestly invariant at compile time or always evaluate the same way during execution, so no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Rationale by controlling expression: \n- if ((0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_GET)) && (0 != strcmp(method, MHD_HTTP_METHOD_HEAD))) \u2014 depends on the runtime parameter method (not invariant).\n- if (&aptr != *req_cls) \u2014 &aptr is an address constant but *req_cls is an input/output parameter that this function modifies across calls; the result can change between invocations, so the controlling expression is not invariant.\n- if (NULL != strstr(url, \"../\")) \u2014 depends on the runtime url parameter (not invariant).\n- if (-1 != fd) and the nested if ((0 != fstat(fd, &buf)) || (! S_ISREG(buf.st_mode))) \u2014 fd and buf.st_mode are runtime values returned from open/fstat; these are not invariant.\n- if (-1 == fd) / else \u2014 decision depends on fd from runtime operations (not invariant).\n- if (NULL == response) \u2014 response is allocated at runtime; not invariant.\n\nNo loops with invariant conditions are present (no while/do-while/for with constant controlling expressions used except the allowed idiom for infinite loops, which does not appear here). Therefore no code fragments need further investigation for Rule 14.3."
