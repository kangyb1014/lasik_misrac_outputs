It could be declared as 'const void *cls' (or 'const void * const cls') to indicate the pointed-to object is not modified, so Rule 8.13 is violated.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 is an advisory that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible, but it must be applied with regard to API compatibility. The parameter void *cls is part of the callback prototype expected by the microhttpd API (a caller-supplied context pointer) and must match that external function signature; changing it to const void * would break the required prototype. In addition, other parameters in this function (e.g. void **req_cls) are used to store non-const pointer values, so keeping the types non-const is necessary for correct usage. Because the parameter type is dictated by an external API, the pointer cannot be made const here and no MISRA 8.13 violation occurs in this context."
