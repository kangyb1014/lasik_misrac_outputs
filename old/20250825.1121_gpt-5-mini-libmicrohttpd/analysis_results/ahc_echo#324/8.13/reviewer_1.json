True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameter 'upload_data_size' is declared as a mutable pointer (size_t *upload_data_size) but the function does not modify the pointed-to object (it is only cast to void). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when possible \u2014 e.g. const size_t *upload_data_size. Therefore, in this translation unit the declaration violates Rule 8.13. (If the external callback API actually requires the function to modify *upload_data_size, the non-const qualification would be justified; however in this code it is unused and could be const.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct in this context. Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should point to const-qualified objects when possible, but it must be applied considering the required function signature. ahc_echo is a callback whose parameter types are dictated by the external API (libmicrohttpd-style callback), which expects size_t *upload_data_size so the function can (in general) update the value. Because the function must match that externally-defined prototype it cannot change the parameter type to const size_t * without breaking the required signature. Casting the unused parameter to void to suppress warnings is the appropriate way to handle an unused API parameter. If this were an internal function not constrained by an external prototype, changing the parameter to const size_t * would be appropriate; however that is not the case here. Therefore the reported violation is not valid."
