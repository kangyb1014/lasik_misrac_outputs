  "explanation": "The report is not proved by the excerpt. MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 forbids calling string-handling functions in a way that permits them to read past the bounds of the object. strlen(PAGE) is only a violation if PAGE is not guaranteed to be NUL-terminated or its bounds are otherwise unknown. In the provided snippet PAGE is used but its definition is not shown; in typical ahc_echo examples PAGE is a string literal or a const char[] initialized with a terminating '\\0', in which case strlen(PAGE) is safe and does not breach 21.17. The agent\u2019s hypothetical (PAGE being a raw buffer filled from I/O without a terminating NUL) correctly describes a scenario that would violate the rule, but no evidence in the shown code indicates that PAGE is defined that way. Therefore the report as stated (that the code violates 21.17) is not correct based on the provided code. Recommendation: ensure PAGE is defined as a NUL-terminated string (e.g. a string literal or const char PAGE[] = "
