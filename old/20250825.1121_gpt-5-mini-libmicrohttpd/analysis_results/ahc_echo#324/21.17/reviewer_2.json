  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the absence of any documented precondition that 'method' is a valid, NUL\u2011terminated string. strcmp reads both pointer operands until a NUL byte is encountered; if method == NULL the call dereferences a NULL pointer, and if method points to a buffer that is not NUL\u2011terminated strcmp may read beyond the object bounds. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 requires that uses of <string.h> functions must not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the referenced objects. The ahc_echo implementation performs no NULL check or otherwise documents/establishes that 'method' is always a valid NUL\u2011terminated string, so the use of strcmp here can lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses and thus violates Rule 21.17 unless there is an external, formally established guarantee (API contract) that 'method' is non\u2011NULL and NUL\u2011terminated. Recommended fixes: check method != NULL before calling strcmp, or rely on/verify an external precondition, or use a bounded comparison with an ensured maximum length."
