  "explanation": "Brief justification for each symbol (why it is needed to check the <string.h> rule for buffer_append):\n\n- memcpy\n  - The standard library call being examined. Its requirements are: destination and source must each point to objects large enough for append_size bytes, and source/destination must not overlap. Inspecting memcpy usage (and any assumptions about non-overlap) is essential.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The macro is present in buffer_append and might have side-effects or annotations used by static analysis to guarantee invariants (e.g. non-NULL buf). Confirming its definition shows whether it can be relied on to mute/establish preconditions or whether it could alter behavior.\n\n- build_header_response\n  - The only caller of buffer_append in the provided call graph. To decide if buffer_append is ever invoked with arguments that would violate bounds/overlap rules we must inspect how build_header_response constructs/initializes: buf, *ppos, buf_size, append, and append_size, and any ordering of calls that could produce overlap or integer-wrap issues.\n\n- get_date_header\n  - One of build_header_response's callees that likely returns or computes data (pointer/size) passed as append. We must know whether it returns a pointer into buf, a pointer to static storage, or writes into caller-owned storage (which affects overlap and lifetime).\n\n- add_user_headers\n  - May produce user-supplied pointers or lengths passed to buffer_append (or mutate ppos/buf_size). Must verify it does not create overlapping source/destination or violate buf bounds.\n\n- MHD_get_reason_phrase_for\n  - Can supply pointer/lengths (reason phrase strings) used as append data. We need to know whether it returns pointers to static storage, to buffers inside buf, or to ephemeral storage, to judge overlap and valid size.\n\n- MHD_get_reason_phrase_len_for\n  - Provides lengths used for copying reason phrases. Confirming the length semantics ensures append_size matches actual source object size and that the bounds check in buffer_append is meaningful.\n\n- MHD_uint16_to_str\n  - Converts numbers to strings and likely supplies append and append_size. Need to know whether it writes into a temporary/static buffer or caller buffer (possible overlap with buf) and the actual produced length.\n\n- MHD_uint64_to_str\n  - Similar to MHD_uint16_to_str: may produce append pointer/size and its storage/lifetime/overlap characteristics must be inspected.\n\n- transmit_error_response_len\n  - A caller of build_header_response (per the call graph). If it calls build_header_response with specific buf/ppos/buf_size invariants that affect safety, those must be checked; include callers to follow invariants upstream.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle\n  - Another caller of build_header_response; included for the same reason as transmit_error_response_len \u2014 callers may set up buffers or reuse memory in ways that could produce overlap or out-of-bounds copies.\n\nIn short: to determine whether buffer_append's memcpy can access beyond object bounds or overlap source/destination, the analysis needs (1) the exact semantics and storage/lifetime of every possible 'append' source (functions that produce the pointer/size), (2) the construction and invariants of buf, *ppos, and buf_size in build_header_response (and its callers), and (3) the definition of mhd_assert and memcpy behavior. The listed symbols cover those concerns without extraneous functions."
