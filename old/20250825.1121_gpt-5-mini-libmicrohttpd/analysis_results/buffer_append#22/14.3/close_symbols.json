  "explanation": "To decide whether the controlling expression in buffer_append (buf_size < *ppos + append_size) can be invariant you must know where the three operands (buf_size, *ppos and append_size) come from and how they can vary. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- build_header_response: the only static caller of buffer_append. You must inspect its call sites to see what actual arguments are passed for buf, ppos, buf_size and append_size and whether any of those are constant/invariant across calls.\n\n- setup_reply_properties, check_connection_reply, connection_maximize_write_buffer: these functions are called by build_header_response and can initialize or modify reply properties, the buffer size (buf_size) or the position pointer semantics. They may make buf_size constant, increase/decrease it, or change the conditions under which append_size is computed.\n\n- MHD_uint16_to_str, MHD_uint64_to_str: these helpers convert integers to textual form and typically return/produce lengths that are used as append_size. Their return values determine whether append_size can be zero/constant or vary with input.\n\n- MHD_get_reason_phrase_len_for, MHD_get_reason_phrase_for: these provide the reason-phrase pointer and its length used for appending; their outputs affect append_size and could be constant (making the controlling expression invariant) or variable.\n\n- get_date_header: supplies the date header string/length; its length (append_size) might be constant or vary (e.g., fixed format), so it influences invariance of the condition.\n\n- add_user_headers: appends user-provided headers whose lengths may be runtime-varying; if this always appends nothing or a fixed-size string it affects whether the condition becomes invariant.\n\n- transmit_error_response_len, MHD_connection_handle_idle: callers of build_header_response. To determine whether buf_size or the initial *ppos passed into build_header_response (and thus into buffer_append) are invariant in the larger program you may need to trace upward to these callers to see if they pass constant/unchanging values.\n\n- size_t (type/standard unsigned-arithmetic semantics): to assess whether the expression *ppos + append_size can overflow/wrap (unsigned modular arithmetic) and whether such wrap makes the comparison invariant or undefined. Knowing that size_t is unsigned and its arithmetic is modulo is necessary for correct static reasoning about invariance of the controlling expression.\n\nCollecting and analysing the definitions, return semantics and call-sites of the above symbols allows an analyzer to determine whether buf_size, *ppos or append_size are effectively constant (invariant) at the control point and therefore whether the MISRA rule is violated."
