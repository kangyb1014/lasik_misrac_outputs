  "explanation": "To determine if this function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions of any non-trivial symbols/macros and the types used in the function:\n\n- mhd_assert: Often a macro. Its definition may expand to compiler-specific builtin(s), attributes, or use extension syntax (e.g. __extension__, __builtin_expect, inline asm, or GCC/Clang attributes). Inspecting its definition is required to tell whether an extension is used.\n\n- memcpy: Although a standard library routine, its visible declaration or mapping in <string.h> (or as a compiler builtin like __builtin_memcpy) can be implemented/aliased using compiler-specific intrinsics or builtins. Check the actual declaration/implementation used in the build to detect extensions.\n\n- size_t: Provided by <stddef.h> or other headers. You must confirm it is the standard typedef and not a compiler-specific extension or unusual typedef that uses extension features.\n\n- bool: Typically from <stdbool.h> mapping to _Bool. Confirming its origin ensures no project-specific boolean type implemented via compiler extensions or macros (e.g. typedefs to int, or use of compiler keywords that are extensions).\n\n- NULL: A macro that can be defined in different ways (0, ((void*)0), compiler-specific __null). Some definitions may use compiler extensions \u2014 inspect the macro.\n\n- <string.h> declaration of memcpy: The header declaration can reveal use of builtin aliases or attributes (e.g. __attribute__((__always_inline__)) or inline asm).\n\n- <stddef.h> / typedef for size_t and <stdbool.h> / definition of bool: The standard headers' contents as used in the project/build must be checked to ensure they are standard C and not replaced by headers that use extensions.\n\n- project header that defines mhd_assert: Include the specific project header where mhd_assert is defined to find any extension usage.\n\nOnly after examining these symbols/headers can you conclude whether the target function itself (or its used macros/declared functions/types) employs language extensions disallowed by the MISRA rule."
