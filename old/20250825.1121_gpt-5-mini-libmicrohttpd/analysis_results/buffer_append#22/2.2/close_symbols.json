Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "build_header_response: direct caller of buffer_append \u2014 you must inspect its implementation to see whether the writes into buf and the update of *ppos produced by buffer_append are actually used (i.e. affect program behaviour) or can be removed. If build_header_response ignores the return value or never reads the appended bytes, buffer_append could be dead code.\n\ntransmit_error_response_len: a caller of build_header_response \u2014 include to determine whether the overall calling chain (and the contexts in which build_header_response is used) depends on the effects of buffer_append (timing or side effects). If higher-level callers never observe the buffer changes, buffer_append may be dead.\n\nMHD_connection_handle_idle: another caller of build_header_response \u2014 same reason as above: different call sites may use build_header_response differently; you must check all call sites to determine whether buffer_append's operations are needed.\n\nmhd_assert: used inside buffer_append \u2014 inspect its definition/expansion to know whether the assertion produces code (side effects, logging) in builds of interest. If mhd_assert expands to nothing in production, any work done solely for the assertion would be dead; if it has side effects, it can make code non-dead.\n\nmemcpy: the library function that performs the buffer write \u2014 include to confirm that it has the expected side-effect (modifies buf) and no hidden behaviour in this project (e.g. custom wrapper, instrumentation). Understanding memcpy semantics is necessary to decide whether removing the memcpy (and the whole append) would change observable behaviour."
