  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. For Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible):\n- append is declared as const char * and is not modified \u2014 correct.\n- buf is declared as char * and is written to via memcpy \u2014 it must not be const.\n- ppos is declared as size_t * and the pointed-to value is modified (*ppos += append_size) \u2014 it must not be const.\n- No other pointer parameters exist. Therefore there are no pointers that could (and should) be const-qualified but are not."
