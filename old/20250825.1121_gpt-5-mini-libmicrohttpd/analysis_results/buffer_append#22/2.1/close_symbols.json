  "explanation": "mhd_assert: This is a macro (or function) used at the top of buffer_append. Its definition may expand to code that affects control flow (e.g. do { if (!(expr)) abort()/return/goto; } while(0)), or to nothing. To prove whether the subsequent statements (memcpy, *ppos += ..., return true) are reachable you must know whether mhd_assert can cause an early exit or otherwise make following code unreachable.\n\nbuild_header_response: This is the direct caller of buffer_append (per the call graph). To determine whether buffer_append itself is unreachable (dead code) you must examine its callers to see whether the call site is ever executed. The body of build_header_response may call buffer_append conditionally; its code is therefore required for reachability analysis.\n\ntransmit_error_response_len and MHD_connection_handle_idle: These are callers of build_header_response (per the call graph). To decide whether build_header_response (and transitively buffer_append) is reachable from program entry points or runtime event hooks you must trace call sites up the call chain. These two symbols are the next-level callers and are therefore required to continue the reachability analysis toward program entry points."
