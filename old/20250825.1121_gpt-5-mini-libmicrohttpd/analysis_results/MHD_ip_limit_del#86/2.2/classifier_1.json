The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_ip_limit_del:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_limit_del (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                  const struct sockaddr_storage *addr,\n                  socklen_t addrlen)\n{\n  struct MHD_IPCount search_key;\n  struct MHD_IPCount *found_key;\n  void **nodep;\n\n  daemon = MHD_get_master (daemon);\n  /* Ignore if no connection limit assigned */\n  if (0 == daemon->per_ip_connection_limit)\n    return;\n  /* Initialize search key */\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_ip_addr_to_key (addr,\n                                    addrlen,\n                                    &search_key))\n    return;\n\n  MHD_ip_count_lock (daemon);\n\n  /* Search for the IP address */\n  if (NULL == (nodep = tfind (&search_key,\n                              &daemon->per_ip_connection_count,\n                              &MHD_ip_addr_compare)))\n  {\n    /* Something's wrong if we couldn't find an IP address\n     * that was previously added */\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Failed to find previously-added IP address.\\n\"));\n  }\n  found_key = (struct MHD_IPCount *) *nodep;\n  /* Validate existing count for IP address */\n  if (0 == found_key->count)\n  {\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Previously-added IP address had counter of zero.\\n\"));\n  }\n  /* Remove the node entirely if count reduces to 0 */\n  if (0 == --found_key->count)\n  {\n    tdelete (found_key,\n             &daemon->per_ip_connection_count,\n             &MHD_ip_addr_compare);\n    MHD_ip_count_unlock (daemon);\n    free (found_key);\n  }\n  else\n    MHD_ip_count_unlock (daemon);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_ip_limit_del:\n#define MHD_PANIC(msg) do{mhd_panic(mhd_panic_cls,__FILE__,__LINE__,msg);BUILTIN_NOT_REACHED;}while(0)\n...\nstatic int\nMHD_ip_addr_compare (const void *a1,\n                     const void *a2)\n{\n  return memcmp (a1,\n                 a2,\n                 offsetof (struct MHD_IPCount,\n                           count));\n}\n...\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nMHD_ip_limit_add (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                  const struct sockaddr_storage *addr,\n                  socklen_t addrlen)\n{\n  struct MHD_IPCount *newkeyp;\n  struct MHD_IPCount *keyp;\n  struct MHD_IPCount **nodep;\n  enum MHD_Result result;\n\n  daemon = MHD_get_master (daemon);\n  /* Ignore if no connection limit assigned */\n  if (0 == daemon->per_ip_connection_limit)\n    return MHD_YES;\n\n  newkeyp = (struct MHD_IPCount *) malloc (sizeof(struct MHD_IPCount));\n  if (NULL == newkeyp)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  /* Initialize key */\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_ip_addr_to_key (addr,\n                                    addrlen,\n                                    newkeyp))\n  {\n    free (newkeyp);\n    return MHD_YES; /* Allow unhandled address types through */\n  }\n\n  MHD_ip_count_lock (daemon);\n\n  /* Search for the IP address */\n  nodep = (struct MHD_IPCount **) tsearch (newkeyp,\n                                           &daemon->per_ip_connection_count,\n                                           &MHD_ip_addr_compare);\n  if (NULL == nodep)\n  {\n    MHD_ip_count_unlock (daemon);\n    free (newkeyp);\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n    MHD_DLOG (daemon,\n              _ (\"Failed to add IP connection count node.\\n\"));\n#endif\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  keyp = *nodep;\n  /* Test if there is room for another connection; if so,\n   * increment count */\n  result = (keyp->count < daemon->per_ip_connection_limit) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The check and MHD_PANIC are not dead code: they are executed if the invariant (found_key->count != 0) is violated. MHD_PANIC calls mhd_panic (and uses BUILTIN_NOT_REACHED) and thus has observable side effects (error reporting/termination). Removing the check and call would change program behaviour when an unexpected zero count occurs (it would continue and produce incorrect counts), so this fragment does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
