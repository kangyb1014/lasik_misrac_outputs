  "explanation": "The fragments selected involve pointers-to-pointers and dereferencing/casting of such pointers returned by tfind; these are the locations where const-qualification of the pointed-to type (or of the intermediate pointer) is most likely to be omitted inadvertently and thus should be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Other pointer usages in this function are not reported because they do not appear to be candidates for adding a const-qualified pointee: - 'search_key' is written to by MHD_ip_addr_to_key, so it cannot be declared as pointing to a const object. - 'found_key' is used to modify the pointee (found_key->count is decremented and free() is called on it), so the pointee must be modifiable and should not be const-qualified. - The 'daemon' parameter is used to modify daemon state (daemon is reassigned and its members are modified), so it cannot be made a pointer-to-const. - Calls to tdelete and use of &daemon->per_ip_connection_count involve APIs that may modify the tree/root pointer, so those pointers cannot be qualified as pointing to const data. Therefore only the nodep/tfind/dereference-cast sites are flagged for further investigation regarding appropriate const qualifications."
