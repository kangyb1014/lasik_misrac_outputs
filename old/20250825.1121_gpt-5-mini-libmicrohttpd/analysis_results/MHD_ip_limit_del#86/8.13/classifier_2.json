  "scenario": "No violation. The code casts *nodep to a non-const struct MHD_IPCount * and later modifies found_key->count (and may free it). Because the object is intentionally modified, it cannot be const-qualified, so Rule 8.13 is not violated. (A violation would occur if the object were only read but the pointer were non-const \u2014 in that case it should be declared const struct MHD_IPCount *.)"
