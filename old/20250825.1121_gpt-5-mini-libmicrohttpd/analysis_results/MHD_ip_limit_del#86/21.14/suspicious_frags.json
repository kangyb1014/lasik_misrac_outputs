  "explanation": "I found one use of memcmp in the provided code: in MHD_ip_addr_compare (memcmp(a1, a2, offsetof(struct MHD_IPCount, count))). This compares the binary contents of struct MHD_IPCount up to the count member (family and addr fields), not null-terminated strings, so it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. No other memcmp calls or strcmp/strncmp usages appear in the supplied code. The other memory functions present (memcpy, memset) operate on binary address data, not C strings. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
