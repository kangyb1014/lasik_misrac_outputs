  "explanation": "The MISRA rule concerns whether the controlling expressions in the function are invariant. The controlling expressions here are: (1) tool_params.single and (2) tool_params.unique (the two if() tests), and (3) '-' == param_name[1] (this last one uses the function parameter and is not a global-invariant unless param_name is constant). To decide if the first two are potentially invariant at compile/time or across the function call you must know exactly how they are declared and qualified:\n\n- tool_params: need the declaration of the global object to determine storage duration and linkage (is it a compile-time const, a macro, or a modifiable global?). If tool_params is a const object or defined as a macro/constant, the tests could be invariant.\n\n- definition of the type of tool_params: need the struct/typedef so we can see the types of the members (are they plain integers, bitfields, enums, _Atomic, volatile, or const-qualified?). The type determines whether reading single/unique is a simple variable read or an expression that may change.\n\n- declaration of tool_params.single and tool_params.unique: need the exact member declarations to know if they are compile-time constants (e.g. macros/enum constants), declared const, volatile, atomic, or bitfields. If they are const-qualified or implemented as macros/compile-time constants, the controlling expressions would be invariant and might violate MISRA unless an exception applies.\n\n- any macro/typedef/qualifier that affects single/unique: in some codebases members are implemented or aliased through macros or typedefs; they might expand to constant expressions or to accessor functions. We must see those definitions to rule out invariance (or to identify volatility/mutability that prevents invariance).\n\nYou do not need fprintf/stderr or the PERF_RPL_PARAM_* enum values to assess invariance of the controlling expressions. The param_name parameter is already visible in the function signature; its character content is not a global invariant, so '-' == param_name[1] is not a compile-time/global invariant unless other symbols show param_name is forced constant (unlikely). Providing the above symbols allows the next agent to determine whether the if() conditions are invariant and thus whether the function violates the MISRA rule."
