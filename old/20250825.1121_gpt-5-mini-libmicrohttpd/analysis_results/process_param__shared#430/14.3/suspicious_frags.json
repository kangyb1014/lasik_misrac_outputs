  "explanation": "Only control-flow expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The three fragments above are the only controlling expressions in the function (two if conditions and the conditional operator). They should be investigated to ensure they are not invariant at runtime (i.e. that the values they test can legitimately change and are not compile-time or truly constant expressions). Other code fragments do not need investigation for this rule: - The static initialization of tool_params with zeros is an object initialization, not a controlling expression; the variable is non-const and may be modified elsewhere, so the if conditions remain candidates for investigation (hence they are reported). - The assignment tool_params.shared = ! 0; is not a control statement and so is outside Rule 14.3. - There are no loops (while/for/do-while) in this function, so the rule exceptions for infinite loops or the do-while constant-false idiom are not applicable here. - No other if/switch/loop/conditional controlling expressions exist in the provided code that would fall under Rule 14.3."
