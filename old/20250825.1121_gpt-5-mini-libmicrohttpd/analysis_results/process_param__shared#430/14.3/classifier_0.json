  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'tool_params.single' is a modifiable member of a static structure (initialized to 0 here) and not declared const. The controlling expression is therefore not an invariant at compile time \u2014 it can be changed at runtime (e.g. by command-line parsing elsewhere). A violation would occur if the expression were truly invariant, e.g. if 'tool_params' were declared const or the code wrote 'if (0)' or 'if (1)' (or 'static const struct PerfRepl_parameters tool_params = {0,...};' with no modifications), which would make the controlling expression permanently constant."
