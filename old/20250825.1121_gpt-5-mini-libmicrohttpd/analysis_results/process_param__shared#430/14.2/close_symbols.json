The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For assessing MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must confirm that this function (and any functions/macros it uses) do not introduce/contain for loops or modify loop counters in their bodies. Each listed symbol is required for that check:\n\n- tool_params: to inspect whether tool_params is a plain object or a macro/function that could expand to/perform looping or side effects. If it is a macro the expansion might contain a for loop.\n- tool_params.single: the field is read in the first if; verify its declaration to ensure the read is a simple boolean/flag access and not a macro or accessor that hides looping or side effects.\n- tool_params.unique: same reason as .single \u2014 ensure it is a simple field access and has no hidden side effects or macro expansion that contains for loops.\n- tool_params.shared: the function writes this field; need the field/type definition to check that the assignment is a simple object write and not a macro/function call that could contain loops or modify external loop counters.\n- type/definition of tool_params (the struct/typedef): to see the actual type of tool_params and its fields (and any associated inline functions/macros), and to confirm there are no overloaded operators, accessor macros, or side-effecting constructs that could violate the for-loop rule.\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result (definition): to ensure the return type and possible return expressions are simple constants and not macro calls that expand to code containing for loops or side effects.\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR: to check whether this symbol is a simple constant (enum/define) and not a macro expanding to code with loops or side effects.\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR: same as above \u2014 verify it is a constant and not a macro/function with side effects.\n- PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR: same as above.\n- fprintf (declaration/prototype): the function is called; although it is a standard library call, you should confirm that in this translation unit it is not shadowed by a macro or local wrapper that could contain for loops or modify loop counters. If fprintf is the standard function, it does not change program loop counters; if it is replaced by a macro or inline wrapper, that could matter.\n- stderr (declaration): confirm stderr is the standard FILE* object and not a macro or object that expands to code with loops/side effects.\n\nWith these symbols resolved you can determine whether any called or expanded code contains for loops or side effects that would make a for statement in this function (or in called/expanded code) non\u2011conforming to the MISRA for\u2011loop rule. Note: the target function itself contains no for loop; the primary concern is whether any of the above symbols are macros/wrappers that introduce for loops or modify loop counters."
