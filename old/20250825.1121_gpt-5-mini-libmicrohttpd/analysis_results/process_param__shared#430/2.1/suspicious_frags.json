  "explanation": "I selected the two conditional blocks, the assignment to tool_params.shared, and the final ternary return because these are the executable statements where unreachable-code issues could arise depending on invariants elsewhere in the project (e.g. whether tool_params.single and tool_params.unique can ever both be true or whether param_name can have properties making branches impossible). No other fragments in this function need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1: the function signature, braces and whitespace are structural, there is no code after a return (no dead tail code), and there are no other statements hidden in macros or additional lines. Note: I did not flag the param_name[1] dereference as an unreachable-code issue because Rule 2.1 concerns reachability; potential undefined behavior from a NULL or short string is a separate concern outside the scope of Rule 2.1 and so was not included."
