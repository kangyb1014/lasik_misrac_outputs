  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;",

  "explanation": "I did not mark the if(...) bodies (fprintf(...) / return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;) as suspicious for dead code because they have observable side-effects (diagnostic output and an early return). Removal of those statements would change program behaviour unless it is proven across the whole project that the corresponding condition can never be true; unreachable code (never executed) is not classified as dead code per the rule notes. The conditional checks (if (tool_params.single) / if (tool_params.unique)) themselves are normal control-flow constructs; whether their bodies are executed (and thus whether those bodies are dead) requires whole-project analysis of how those flags are set. Likewise the function signature and the surrounding structure are unaffected by Rule 2.2 in this context. Therefore only the assignment to tool_params.shared and the final ternary return are reported as suspicious: the assignment could be a no-op if the field is never read elsewhere, and the ternary return may contain a branch that never affects behavior (e.g. if both enum values are identical or the checked character never differs) \u2014 both require project-wide inspection to confirm whether they constitute dead code."
