  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_param__shared:\n```c\nstatic enum PerfRepl_param_result\nprocess_param__shared (const char *param_name)\n{\n  if (tool_params.single)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-I' or '--single'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  if (tool_params.unique)\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Parameter '%s' cannot be used together \"\n             \"with '-U' or '--unique'.\\n\", param_name);\n    return PERF_RPL_PARAM_ERROR;\n  }\n  tool_params.shared = ! 0;\n  return '-' == param_name[1] ?\n         PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR :PERF_RPL_PARAM_ONE_CHAR;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ntool_params.shared = ! 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the statement sets tool_params.shared to true (\"! 0\" yields 1) and thus changes program state; removing it would typically affect behaviour where that flag is subsequently read. This would only violate Rule 2.2 if, in the whole project, tool_params.shared is never read after this assignment (i.e. the assignment is executed but has no observable effect)."
