Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Explaination of why each symbol is required for MISRA 'for loop well-formed' analysis:\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: This macro is used repeatedly in the function. If it expands to code (expression or macro that contains control flow or loops) it can introduce for-statements or change the function body; its expansion must be inspected to be sure no for-loop is introduced or malformed.\n\n- MHD_str_remove_tokens_caseless_: This call may be a macro or an inline/static function. If it expands inline it can introduce for loops into the body of del_response_header_connection (MISRA treats loop behaviour within the function body and any inlined expansions as part of the function). Also it modifies hdr->value_size and hdr->value, so its side-effects are essential to determine whether any loop counters (if present) are modified inappropriately.\n\n- MHD_get_response_element_n_: The function is called to obtain hdr. If this is an inline/static definition that expands into the caller, it could introduce loops. Its prototype/definition is also needed to confirm whether it changes any objects that could act as loop counters or loop control flags used by any for statements introduced by macros/inlines.\n\n- _MHD_remove_header: This function/macro is invoked inside the conditional block. If it is a macro/inline implementation it may contain for loops; inspect to ensure any for loops coming from it are well-formed and do not violate MISRA constraints when considered in the context of this function.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND and MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION: These symbols are arguments to MHD_get_response_element_n_. Their definitions (constants or macros) are required because they may be macros with expansion or determine which code-path of an inline callee is taken (and thus whether loops are present).\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The layout is required to know the type of response->flags_auto and to see whether any members used as loop counters or control flags exist or could be modified elsewhere. The type of flags_auto matters for what constitutes a \"loop control flag\" (boolean/enum) under MISRA.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header: Required to know the exact types of hdr->value_size, hdr->value and hdr->header (e.g., whether value_size is an integer type usable as a loop counter) and whether these fields can be modified by called/inlined routines (affecting clause 2/3 of the MISRA rule).\n\n- hdr->value_size (type): The type (size_t, unsigned, etc.) is needed to determine whether it could legally be used as a loop counter and whether any called code modifies it (violating the single loop-counter rule) or whether it is used in loop clauses elsewhere after inlining.\n\n- hdr->value (type/representation): The actual representation (char *, array, writable buffer length) is required because functions or macros operating on it (e.g., token removal) could contain loops acting on this buffer; knowing its type helps determine whether those loops would use or modify objects prohibited by MISRA.\n\n- hdr->header (type): Freed in this function; if any inline expansion accesses or loops over it, need its type/representation for analysis.\n\n- response->flags_auto (type): The MISRA rule permits a single loop counter and optionally a loop control flag (boolean). Knowing the type of flags_auto (enum, integer width) and whether it can act as a loop control flag is necessary when analysing any for-loop clauses introduced via inlines/macros.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseAutoFlags: Its definition is needed to understand the flags usage as possible loop control flags and to check that bitwise operations or modifications do not violate the MISRA constraint about objects modified in the loop body/clauses.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_HDR, MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE: Specific flag constants used in bit-operations; needed to understand how flags_auto is modified and whether that modification might conflict with any loop counter/flag use if loops appear in expanded/inlined code.\n\n- enum MHD_Result, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: The return values and enum type are not likely to affect for-loop formation directly but are included to fully understand the function's control flow and any macros or inline implementations that might use or alter control flow (and possibly contain loops) depending on these values.\n\n- strlen, memcmp, free: These standard functions are called. If any are implemented as macros or inline functions in this codebase they could introduce loops into the function body; include their definitions to be certain. Also the presence of calls to these functions means inlined implementations could modify objects used as loop counters/flags.\n\nGeneral note: The MISRA for-loop rule applies to for-statements present in the function body and to the behaviour of any functions called within a for statement body. Even though del_response_header_connection contains no explicit for(...) statements, macros or inline/static function expansions (MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, MHD_str_remove_tokens_caseless_, _MHD_remove_header, MHD_get_response_element_n_ etc.) can inject for-statements into the function body; therefore their definitions and the types they touch (hdr members, response->flags_auto and related enums) are required to determine any MISRA violations. Inspect these symbols' definitions/expansions to see whether any for-loops appear and, if so, whether they obey the three CLAUSES and single-counter constraints."
