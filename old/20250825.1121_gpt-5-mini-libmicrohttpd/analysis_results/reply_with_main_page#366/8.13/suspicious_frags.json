  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const where appropriate or require non-const pointers: - 'static const char page_content[] = MAIN_PAGE;' is already const-qualified. - 'static const size_t page_content_len = ...' is a non-pointer constant; Rule 8.13 applies to pointer types only. - 'struct MHD_Response *resp;' is a non-const pointer to an object that is modified by library calls (adding headers, destroying), so it is expected to be non-const. - 'enum MHD_Result ret;' is not a pointer. - Calls that destroy or modify the response (MHD_destroy_response) necessarily operate on a non-const pointer. Therefore they need no further investigation for this rule."
