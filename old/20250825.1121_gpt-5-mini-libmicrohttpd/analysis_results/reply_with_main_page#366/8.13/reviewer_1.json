Passing page_content to a non-const parameter discards the const qualifier \u2014 i.e. a pointer to const is being passed where a pointer to non-const is required. That discarding of const-qualification violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If the function were declared to take a const void * parameter, there would be no violation.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 requires that pointers point to const-qualified types when the object is not modified \u2014 the code declares page_content as static const char[] and therefore complies with that rule. The agent\u2019s concern is about passing a pointer-to-const to a function whose parameter is non-const; that would be an issue about discarding const qualification (a rule that forbids removing const qualifiers on conversions), not a violation of 8.13 itself. If MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static actually has a non-const parameter, the appropriate MISRA concern would be the prohibition on discarding const qualification (not 8.13), and the remedies are to change the function prototype to accept a const-qualified pointer, to pass a non-const copy, or to provide a documented deviation for an explicit cast. But as written, the declaration of page_content satisfies Rule 8.13, so the agent\u2019s claim that this code violates Rule 8.13 is false."
