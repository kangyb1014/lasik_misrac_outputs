  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided functions. Rationale:\n\n- reply_with_main_page: All statements are on reachable control paths. The early return (if NULL == resp) is a legitimate conditional exit; remaining statements (adding header, queuing response, destroying response, returning ret) are reachable when resp is non-NULL. There is no code following an unconditional return or infinite loop that would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- MHD_destroy_response: The initial NULL check returns early if response is NULL \u2014 this is a reachable conditional exit. The reference_count decrement and its conditional return are reachable control flow branches (the function continues only when the count reaches zero). The while loop freeing headers iterates while first_header is non-NULL and terminates when the list is exhausted; it is not inherently unreachable. The conditional blocks guarded by preprocessor checks (#if defined(...)) are not evidence of unreachable code in the translation unit \u2014 they are included or excluded at compile time depending on macros, which is normal and not the MISRA Rule 2.1 unreachable-code issue.\n\nBecause all returns and branches are used in legitimate, reachable control paths and there are no statements that are never executable within the shown code, there are no code fragments to flag for investigation regarding MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in the supplied snippets."
