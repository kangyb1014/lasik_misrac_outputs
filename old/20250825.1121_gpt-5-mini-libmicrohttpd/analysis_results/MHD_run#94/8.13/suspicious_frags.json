  "explanation": "The only pointer in this snippet is the function parameter 'daemon'. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that could point to const-qualified types; therefore the declaration of the parameter and each use where it is passed (or accessed) are the relevant fragments to inspect. Other code in the snippet (return statements, enum result values, the cast-to-void of the call result, and surrounding punctuation) do not introduce pointer declarations or pointer types that could be const-qualified and thus do not need investigation."
