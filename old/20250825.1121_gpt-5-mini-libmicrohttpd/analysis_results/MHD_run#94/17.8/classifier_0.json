  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The code only reads the parameter and its pointee: it tests daemon->shutdown and passes daemon to MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_. There is no assignment to the parameter variable (daemon) itself, so the pointer is not modified. (Only if the MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ macro were to assign to its argument would a violation occur \u2014 based on the fragment shown no such modification happens.)"
