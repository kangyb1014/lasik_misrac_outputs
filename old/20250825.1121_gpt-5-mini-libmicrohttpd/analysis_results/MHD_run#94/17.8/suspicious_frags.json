  "explanation": "No other code fragments in this function require investigation for Rule 17.8. The function does not contain any assignment to the parameter identifier 'daemon' (no statements like 'daemon = ...', no pointer arithmetic on 'daemon', no ++/-- on it). The remaining lines are simple return statements and the function signature; these do not modify the parameter itself. The two fragments reported are the only places where the parameter identifier is used in a way that could (via macro expansion or an unexpected macro definition) modify the parameter variable, so they are included for investigation. All other fragments are plain dereference/returns and thus do not violate the rule."
