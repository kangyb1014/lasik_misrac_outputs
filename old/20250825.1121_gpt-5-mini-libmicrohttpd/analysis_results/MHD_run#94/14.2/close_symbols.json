The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n- MHD_run_wait: MHD_run immediately calls MHD_run_wait. Even though MHD_run itself contains no for loops, MISRA's interpretation of a for-loop body includes the behaviour of functions called from that loop; therefore any loops in MHD_run_wait (or behaviour that affects loop counters/side effects) are relevant to determining compliance of the overall call path. You must inspect MHD_run_wait's implementation for for-loops and their compliance.\n\n- MHD_poll_all, MHD_cleanup_connections, MHD_epoll, MHD_select: These are the direct callees of MHD_run_wait (per the static call graph). For-compliance analysis must examine any for-loops in these functions because they are executed as part of MHD_run_wait's behaviour. Their loop counters, side effects, and use of other objects can cause MISRA violations that propagate to the caller path.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition, fields): The target function tests daemon->shutdown and calls MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon). Knowing the daemon structure (especially the shutdown field and any fields referenced by the threads macro) is needed to determine whether MHD_run_wait is actually reachable at runtime and to understand any data items that may act as loop counters or loop-control flags if referenced in called functions.\n\n- MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (macro / inline function): The if-condition uses this macro; its expansion may reference daemon fields or have side effects that affect control flow. To be sure MHD_run_wait is invoked unconditionally or conditionally, and whether any side effects modify objects that might be used as loop counters elsewhere, you must see the macro definition.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and constants MHD_YES, MHD_NO: These are the return values used in MHD_run. While they do not affect for-loop structure directly, having their declarations helps the analyzer understand control flow and return semantics of the function under analysis.\n\n- Prototypes/declarations for the above functions: To locate the definitions and ensure you analyze the correct implementations (and any inline attributes), the prototypes or headers that declare these functions are required.\n\n- All transitive callees of MHD_run_wait: Any function called by MHD_poll_all, MHD_cleanup_connections, MHD_epoll, or MHD_select may contain for-loops or modify objects used as loop counters/flags. MISRA's rule counts behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body, so you must recursively inspect transitive callees for loop compliance.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the target (and its immediate call path) violates the MISRA for-loop rule you must examine MHD_run_wait and its entire reachable call subtree (and the daemon type and the threads macro that gate the call). The listed symbols are the minimal entry points needed to find and analyze those implementations and relevant data definitions."
