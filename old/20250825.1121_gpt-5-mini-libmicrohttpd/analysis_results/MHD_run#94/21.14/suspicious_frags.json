  "explanation": "No use of memcmp or any string-comparison operations exists in the provided code fragment. The function only tests a shutdown flag (daemon->shutdown), evaluates a macro MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon), and calls MHD_run_wait(daemon, 0). There are no calls to memcmp, no pointer arithmetic or byte-wise comparisons of character arrays, and no handling of null-terminated strings in this snippet. Any potential memcmp usage would be inside other functions or macros (e.g. MHD_run_wait or MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_), but those definitions are not part of the provided code and therefore are outside the scope of this review. Consequently, there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
