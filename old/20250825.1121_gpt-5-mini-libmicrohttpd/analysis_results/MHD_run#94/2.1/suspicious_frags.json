  "suspicious_frags": [
    "if ( (daemon->shutdown) ||\n       MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (daemon) )\n    return MHD_NO;",
    "(void) MHD_run_wait (daemon, 0);",
    "return MHD_YES;"
  ],
  "explanation": "The function contains a conditional return and subsequent statements; unreachable-code issues would arise if the condition is effectively always true (making the call to MHD_run_wait and the return MHD_YES unreachable) or always false (making the return MHD_NO unreachable). The macro MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ and the initialization/usage of daemon->shutdown must be inspected to determine if the branches are actually reachable. Other parts of the function (signature, braces, the return MHD_NO line included above) are either part of these fragments or are not statements that could be unreachable on their own, so no additional fragments need investigation."
