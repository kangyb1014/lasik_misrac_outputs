  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated given the provided information. The if-condition tests runtime state (daemon->shutdown or MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon)), so the later call to MHD_run_wait and return MHD_YES are reachable when the condition is false. There is no evidence that either subexpression is a compile\u2011time constant true. (A violation would occur only if MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ or daemon->shutdown were a compile\u2011time constant that always evaluated true, e.g. the macro expands to 1, which would make the remainder of the function unreachable.)"
