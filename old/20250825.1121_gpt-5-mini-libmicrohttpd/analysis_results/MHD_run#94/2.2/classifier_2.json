  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_run:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_run (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  if ( (daemon->shutdown) ||\n       MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (daemon) )\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  (void) MHD_run_wait (daemon, 0);\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void) MHD_run_wait (daemon, 0);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the call to MHD_run_wait(daemon, 0) is an executed operation that very likely has side effects (blocks, waits for/dispatches events, updates daemon state). Removing this call would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. (Hypothetical violation: if MHD_run_wait were a pure function with no side effects and its return value unused, then the call would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.)"
