  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_run:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_run (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  if ( (daemon->shutdown) ||\n       MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (daemon) )\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  (void) MHD_run_wait (daemon, 0);\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nMHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (daemon)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in typical use: the macro-like fragment MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon) is evaluated as part of the if condition and therefore affects control flow; removing it would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. (Hypothetical violation scenario: if the macro is defined as a compile-time constant with no effect, e.g. #define MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(d) 0 or it expands to an expression that the compiler can prove always has the same value in the whole program, then the evaluation would be redundant and could constitute dead code.)"
