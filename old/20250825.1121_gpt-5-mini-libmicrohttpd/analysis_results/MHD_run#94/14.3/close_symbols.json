  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Daemon (full definition): The if tests members of this struct, so the struct definition is required to see member types and qualifiers. If the struct or its members are declared const/volatile/atomic that affects whether the controlling expression can be considered invariant.\n\n- MHD_Daemon::shutdown (declaration/type/qualifiers): The expression daemon->shutdown is part of the controlling expression. We must know its type (int/enum/bool), and any qualifiers (const, volatile, atomic) to determine whether its value can change at runtime or is effectively invariant.\n\n- MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (macro or function definition/expansion): This symbol is the other operand of the ||. If it is a macro that expands to a compile-time constant (or to an expression that does not depend on runtime state) the whole controlling expression could be invariant. We need the exact definition/expansion to decide.\n\n- Any compile-time configuration macros referenced by MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (e.g. build flags that make it a constant): If the threads-check macro uses build-time flags, that can make the test a constant. Those macros must be provided to judge invariance.\n\n- Definitions of functions that modify daemon->shutdown (e.g. MHD_stop_daemon, MHD_start_daemon): To know whether daemon->shutdown can change during program execution (and therefore is not invariant) we need to see the code that sets or clears it. Include known candidates from the codebase (MHD_stop_daemon, MHD_start_daemon) and any other writers.\n\n- Any struct members or globals read by MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (e.g. daemon->thread_pool, daemon->options): If MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ reads other daemon fields or globals, we must inspect those members' declarations and any writers to them to determine whether that part of the controlling expression is runtime-varying or constant.\n\nProviding these symbols lets the next analyst decide whether either operand (daemon->shutdown or MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_) is an invariant (compile-time constant or effectively unchanging) and therefore whether the if's controlling expression violates MISRA C rule \"Controlling expressions shall not be invariant.\""
