The call (void) MHD_run_wait(daemon, 0); is an ordinary function call with no controlling-expression semantics and cannot be an invariant controlling expression. The return statements and the final return MHD_YES; are not controlling expressions. There are no loops (while/for/do-while) or other conditional statements in this function to inspect for Rule 14.3 compliance."
