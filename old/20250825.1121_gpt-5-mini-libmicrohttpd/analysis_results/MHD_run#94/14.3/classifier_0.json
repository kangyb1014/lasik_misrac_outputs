  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the if controlling expression depends on daemon->shutdown and the result of MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_(daemon), both of which are runtime-dependent, so the expression is not invariant. (It would only violate Rule 14.3 if both operands were compile-time constants making the whole expression a constant.)"
