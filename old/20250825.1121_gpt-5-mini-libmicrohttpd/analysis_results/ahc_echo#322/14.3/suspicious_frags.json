  "explanation": "Rule 14.3 concerns controlling expressions (conditions of if, switch, while, do-while, for and conditional operator). I examined the function and the related helper and included all controlling expressions that could potentially be invariant and therefore require investigation. Other fragments in the code (variable declarations, (void) casts to suppress unused warnings, function calls, memory allocation/free, return statements, and non-controlling expressions) are not relevant to Rule 14.3 and thus need not be investigated for this rule. No loops with obviously constant controlling expressions were present beyond the listed conditional expressions."
