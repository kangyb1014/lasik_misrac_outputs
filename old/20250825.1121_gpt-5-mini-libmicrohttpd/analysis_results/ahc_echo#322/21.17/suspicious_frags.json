  "explanation": "Other fragments in the provided code do not need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not invoke string.h functions that can read/write via pointer parameters beyond object bounds, or they include explicit size checks that prevent overruns. Specifically:\n- The two snprintf calls (snprintf (NULL, 0, ...) to compute resp_len, and snprintf (me, buf_size, ...)) use the same format and arguments; the code computes resp_len first, allocates buf_size = (size_t)resp_len + 1, and checks that the second snprintf returns resp_len, ensuring the buffer size is sufficient and preventing overflow.\n- The allocation and free of the response buffer (malloc, free) and the use of MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback pass the correct length (buf_size - 1) for the response payload; these do not call string.h functions that could access beyond bounds.\n- No other string.h functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, memcmp, or strspn appear in the supplied code.\n- The MHD_lookup_connection_value call in this file uses the literal \"q\" as key; although the lookup helper calls strlen(key), the helper guards against key == NULL. For other callers not shown, callers must ensure keys are valid NUL-terminated strings; that helper usage is included in the suspicious list above for investigation.\n\nTherefore the fragments listed are the only locations that merit further inspection for potential out-of-bounds accesses related to functions in <string.h>."
