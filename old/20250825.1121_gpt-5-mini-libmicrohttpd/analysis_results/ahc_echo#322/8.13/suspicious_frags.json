  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because they already use const qualification where appropriate or clearly require a non-const pointer: the parameters declared as const char * (url, method, version, upload_data) and the local const char *val are already const-qualified and thus conform to Rule 8.13. The buffer variable me is written to (via snprintf and malloc) so it must be a non-const char * and should not be const-qualified. Calls that pass me to the response API cast it to void * because the API expects a modifiable buffer and a free callback; these uses therefore are not candidates for adding const. Standard library usages (snprintf, malloc, free) and response creation/queueing are normal and do not indicate a missing const qualification. The listed suspicious fragments are the places where pointers (or the pointed-to object) are declared or used as non-const but could reasonably be expected to require investigation for possible const qualification under MISRA C Rule 8.13."
