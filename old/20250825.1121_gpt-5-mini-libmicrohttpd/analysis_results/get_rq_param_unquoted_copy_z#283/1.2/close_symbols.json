  "explanation": "To determine whether get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z uses any compiler language extensions we must inspect any called functions/macros and data-type definitions used by the function, because extensions often appear there (attributes, compiler builtins, statement-expression macros, asm, typeof, nested functions, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, etc.). Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuthParam (full definition): The function indexes into param->value and reads param->quoted and param->value.len/str. The struct (and any nested union/struct definitions for .value) might contain language-extension constructs (e.g. bit-fields with implementation-specific widths, GCC attributes, packed/ aligned attributes, flexible-array members with nonstandard syntax, or other compiler-specific annotations). The full type is needed to check for such extensions and to ensure that member access is standard C.\n\n- declaration/definition of MHD_str_unquote: This callee is invoked directly. Its declaration or implementation may use compiler extensions (eg. GCC __attribute__ annotations, inline asm, builtin types, statement expressions, typeof, or be implemented as a macro that expands to nonstandard code). We must inspect it to ensure the call site doesn't rely on extensions.\n\n- definition of mhd_assert (macro or function): The code uses mhd_assert(...) twice. Many projects implement assert-like macros using statement-expressions, typeof, or compiler-specific attributes. To verify no language extensions are used we must see the exact definition/expansion of mhd_assert.\n\n- prototype/declaration of memcpy (from <string.h>): Although memcpy is a standard C library function, its header or implementation could be provided as a macro or as an intrinsic with compiler-specific annotations. Inspecting the prototype ensures no nonstandard macro or builtin is used at the call site.\n\n- definitions of NULL and size_t (from <stddef.h> or equivalent headers): These identifiers are used in the function (NULL != param->value.str and return type size_t). Their definitions may, in some environments, be implemented with compiler extensions (e.g. typeof-based size_t aliases, nonstandard typedefs, or macros). Confirming standard definitions ensures no extension is being relied upon.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their header/declaration/implementation) allows a thorough check for explicit compiler extensions in macros, attributes, builtin functions, asm, or other nonstandard constructs that would violate the MISRA rule about language extensions."
