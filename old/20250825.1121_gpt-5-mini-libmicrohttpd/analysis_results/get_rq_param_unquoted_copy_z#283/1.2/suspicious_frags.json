  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The fragments use only standard C constructs: function definitions, standard types (size_t), pointers, const, struct access, standard control flow (if/while), character and integer literals, and standard library-like calls (memcpy). No compiler-extension tokens or constructs are present (for example, there are no occurrences of __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ or __declspec, __builtin_*, typeof or __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, label-as-values (&&label), or other known vendor-specific extensions). The only macro-like symbol is mhd_assert, but its definition was not provided; there is no evidence in the shown code that it expands to a compiler extension. Therefore there are no code fragments to flag for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
