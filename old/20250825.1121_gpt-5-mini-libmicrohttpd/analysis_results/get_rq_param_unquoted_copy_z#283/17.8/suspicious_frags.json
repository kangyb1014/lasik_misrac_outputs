  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function does not assign to any parameter variables: 'param' is only read (and points to const data), and 'buf' is only dereferenced/written via memcpy and direct indexing (modifying the object pointed to by the parameter is permitted under Rule 17.8). There are no statements that reassign either pointer parameter (e.g. no \"param = ...\" or \"buf = ...\"), so the code does not violate the rule. Calls to MHD_str_unquote and memcpy modify the buffer contents (allowed) and the mhd_asserts only inspect values."
