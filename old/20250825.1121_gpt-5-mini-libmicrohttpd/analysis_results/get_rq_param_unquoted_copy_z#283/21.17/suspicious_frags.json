  "explanation": "I flagged the calls that copy data into 'buf' or call a string/unquote routine and the subsequent writes of the NUL terminator, because MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string-handling functions and any operations that may write past the destination buffer. Other fragments in the function do not perform string-library copying or buffer writes and therefore do not need investigation under this rule: the function signature and local declaration (size_t len;), the control-flow (if (! param->quoted) { ... }), the return statements, and the mhd_assert checks (these are assertions and not string.h calls). These parts do not themselves invoke the standard string functions or perform memory writes beyond those already listed, so they are not directly relevant to Rule 21.17."
