If the caller provides buf with only param->value.len bytes (i.e. no extra byte for a NUL), then the non-quoted branch copies param->value.len bytes via memcpy into buf and the subsequent buf[param->value.len] = 0 writes one past the allocated buffer \u2014 an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. Because memcpy (from <string.h>) is used without guaranteeing space for the terminator, this can result in a bounds violation (MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The non-quoted branch copies param->value.len bytes into buf and then writes a NUL at buf[param->value.len]. If the caller provided buf with only param->value.len bytes (i.e. no space for the terminator) that final write is an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 requires that uses of the <string.h> functions must not lead to accesses beyond the bounds of the referenced objects; here the sequence (memcpy followed by buf[param->value.len] = 0) can produce such an access. The quoted branch is safe if buf has param->value.len bytes because MHD_str_unquote returns a shorter length, but the non\u2011quoted branch is unsafe unless the caller guarantees buf is at least param->value.len + 1 bytes. Either validate/require the extra byte or adjust the copy to ensure space for the terminator to remove the violation."
