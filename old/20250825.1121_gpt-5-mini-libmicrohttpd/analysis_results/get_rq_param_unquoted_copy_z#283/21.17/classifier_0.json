  "scenario": "No direct violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the call is to MHD_str_unquote (a project function), not one of the <string.h> library functions listed by the rule. However, a memory\u2011safety violation can still occur if MHD_str_unquote writes more bytes into buf than expected. A concrete violating scenario: if MHD_str_unquote ignores the provided length and copies/writes more than param->value.len bytes (or does not NUL\u2011terminate within that bound), it can write beyond buf (overflowing buf if buf was only allocated for param->value.len+1 bytes). That would be a general out\u2011of\u2011bounds access, but it is not a direct breach of Rule 21.17 which applies to the standard <string.h> functions."
