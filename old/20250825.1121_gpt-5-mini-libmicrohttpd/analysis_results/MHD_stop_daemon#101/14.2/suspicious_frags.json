First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for loops. The only for statements in the provided function are the two loops above, so they are the only fragments that need investigation for this rule. Other parts of the function do not contain for statements and therefore cannot violate Rule 14.2. The two flagged loops share the same loop counter (i) and use the same loop condition (daemon->worker_pool_size). They must be reviewed because the loop condition accesses daemon->worker_pool_size while the loop bodies perform operations (including calling MHD_itc_activate_ and MHD_stop_daemon) that could, depending on their implementations, affect objects used in the condition or have persistent side effects \u2014 exactly the kinds of interactions Rule 14.2 aims to prevent. No other for-loops or constructs relevant to Rule 14.2 are present in the submitted code, so no additional fragments need investigation for this rule."
