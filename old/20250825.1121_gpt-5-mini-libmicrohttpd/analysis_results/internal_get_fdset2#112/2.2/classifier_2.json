The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of internal_get_fdset2:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ninternal_get_fdset2 (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                     fd_set *read_fd_set,\n                     fd_set *write_fd_set,\n                     fd_set *except_fd_set,\n                     MHD_socket *max_fd,\n                     int fd_setsize)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *pos;\n  struct MHD_Connection *posn;\n  enum MHD_Result result = MHD_YES;\n  MHD_socket ls;\n  bool itc_added;\n\n#ifndef HAS_FD_SETSIZE_OVERRIDABLE\n  (void) fd_setsize;  /* Mute compiler warning */\n  fd_setsize = (int) FD_SETSIZE; /* Help compiler to optimise */\n#endif /* !

  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The unconditional 'if (1)' surrounding the upgrade-handles loop is dead code: the condition is a constant true expression so the condition evaluation (and the if statement itself) is executed but removing it (i.e. leaving the body alone) would not change program behaviour. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note: the whole block is already guarded by the preprocessor #if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) && defined(UPGRADE_SUPPORT), but when that block is compiled the 'if (1)' remains redundant and therefore constitutes dead code.)"
