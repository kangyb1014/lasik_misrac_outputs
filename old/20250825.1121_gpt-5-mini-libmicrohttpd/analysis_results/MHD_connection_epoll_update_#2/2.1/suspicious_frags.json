  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function and the related macros/definitions provided. No code fragment is provably unreachable at compile time: \n\n- The initial mhd_assert is a no-op macro ((void)0) but that only removes a runtime check; it does not make any subsequent code unreachable.\n- Both conditional blocks in MHD_connection_epoll_update_ depend on runtime fields of connection and daemon (event_loop_info, epoll_state, options), so their bodies are potentially reachable depending on program state.\n- The epoll_ctl failure branch (which calls cleanup_connection and returns MHD_NO) is reachable at runtime when epoll_ctl fails; cleanup_connection itself contains an early return if connection->in_cleanup which is a runtime condition, not unreachable code.\n- HAVE_MESSAGES is defined, so the logging code is compiled in; the MHD_DLOG implementation does an early return when logging is disabled via daemon->options, but that is a runtime guard \u2014 the call site is reachable.\n- No preprocessor condition or constant expression in the provided code forces any branch or statement to be dead. The macros shown do not expand to control-flow that would make code unreachable.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in the provided code that should be flagged as unreachable under MISRA C Rule 2.1. If additional headers or constant definitions (e.g., fixed values for connection->event_loop_info or epoll_state via macros) exist elsewhere in the project, those should be re-evaluated, but based on the supplied code and definitions, no unreachable code was found."
