  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are manifestly invariant at compile time. Each conditional depends on runtime state or function results: \n\n- The first if tests connection->event_loop_info and connection->epoll_state via bitwise operations \u2014 both are runtime fields, so the expression is not invariant.\n- The second large if composes several checks against connection->epoll_state and connection->event_loop_info; all operands are runtime data, so the combined controlling expression is not a compile-time constant.\n- The epoll_ctl call is used inside an if that tests its return value; this depends on the runtime result of epoll_ctl and therefore is not invariant.\n- The nested if under #ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES checks daemon->options at runtime; the #ifdef only controls compilation, not the controlling expression being an invariant constant at runtime.\n\nmhd_assert is a macro invocation used as a diagnostic; it is not a language-level controlling statement in this code fragment and does not constitute an invariant controlling expression. No do-while or intentionally infinite-loop constructs are present that would fall under the rule exceptions.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 in this function."
