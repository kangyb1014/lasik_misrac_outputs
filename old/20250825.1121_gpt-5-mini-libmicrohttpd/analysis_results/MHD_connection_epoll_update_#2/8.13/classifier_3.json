  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: event.data.ptr is the epoll API's void * member, so the pointer type is dictated by the API and cannot be made const-qualified here. Assigning the (non-const) struct MHD_Connection * to event.data.ptr does not breach MISRA Rule 8.13 because it is not possible to change the API declaration to a const-qualified pointer and the assignment is intentional. (If immutability were required, you would need a different API or store a pointer to a const object in a separate application-owned field.)"
