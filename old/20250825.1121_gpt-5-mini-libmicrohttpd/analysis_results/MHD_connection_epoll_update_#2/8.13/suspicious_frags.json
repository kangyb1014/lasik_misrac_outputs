  "explanation": "I did not include fragments that clearly cannot/should not be made to point to const-qualified types: - Modifications of the connection object (e.g. assignments to connection->epoll_state, connection->state) show the function intentionally mutates *connection, so the function parameter itself is unlikely to be made a pointer-to-const. - Local object initialisation and modification (e.g. struct epoll_event event; event.events = ...) operate on a local non-pointer object, not a pointer-to-data that should be const-qualified. - Use of scalar fields (connection->socket_fd, daemon->epoll_fd, bitwise tests on event_loop_info/epoll_state) are not pointer targets. - Logging and assert calls read data only; they do not indicate that the pointed-to types could be const. The listed fragments are those involving pointer declarations/assignments or pointer-valued API uses where a const qualification of the pointed-to type might be possible or should be checked (e.g. whether daemon or the data pointer passed to epoll/event APIs could/should be const)."
