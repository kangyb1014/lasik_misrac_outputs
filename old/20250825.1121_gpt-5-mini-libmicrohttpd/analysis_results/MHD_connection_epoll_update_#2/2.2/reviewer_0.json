  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. In the provided project configuration mhd_assert expands to ((void)0), so the statement mhd_assert (MHD_D_IS_USING_EPOLL_ (daemon)); becomes an expression-statement that performs no observable action. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, any executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour is dead code. The assertion expansion is reachable (not \"unreachable code\") and removing that statement would not change program behaviour in this configuration, therefore it constitutes dead code and violates Rule 2.2. (If the macro can be configured to perform checks in other builds, that is a different configuration; the rule applies to the project as built.)"
