  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for determining violations of the MISRA dead\u2011code rule:\n\n- struct Sha512_256Ctx\n  - Needed to know layout and types of ctx->count, ctx->buffer, ctx->H and ctx->count_bits_hi. This determines whether assignments/clearing (memset(ctx,...)) have observable effects and whether buffer/alignment assumptions make branches redundant.\n\n- SHA512_256_BLOCK_SIZE, SHA512_256_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD, SHA512_256_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS\n  - These constants control padding logic and indexing into ctx->buffer. Their values affect whether branches (the 'no space' branch, the padding memset length, and the final put positions) can ever be optimized away (i.e. are dead) or are sometimes executed.\n\n- SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE, SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE_WORDS, SHA512_256_BYTES_IN_WORD\n  - Sizes used to allocate/format the digest and temporary buffer. Needed to see whether the temporary aligned buffer and the memcpy/copy paths are required or redundant.\n\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_BE\n  - Macro/function that writes 64\u2011bit words in big\u2011endian order. Must be inspected to see whether it has side effects beyond simple stores (affects whether its calls are dead), and whether different definitions make branches compile out.\n\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_BE_UNALIGNED, _MHD_UINT64_ALIGN, MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  - Compile\u2011time macros that control which code-paths are compiled and which runtime alignment checks occur. Their definitions determine whether one branch or the other is always taken (making the other branch dead code) or whether both can be executed.\n\n- sha512_256_transform\n  - The transform function has side effects on ctx->H (and possibly other state). To decide if earlier operations (e.g. padding, buffer writes, previous memset) are removable without changing behaviour we must know exactly what this function reads/writes.\n\n- digest_calc_hash and its callers (calculate_nonce, calc_userdigest, calc_userhash, digest_auth_check_all_inner)\n  - To determine whether particular branches (notably the alignment path that tests the destination digest pointer) are ever executed in the whole program, inspect call sites: how they allocate or pass the digest buffer (aligned stack/static buffers vs unaligned pointers). If every caller always passes an aligned buffer one branch may be dead.\n\n- memset, memcpy\n  - Standard library functions used for zeroing and copying. Their behaviour must be assumed (or their replacements inspected) to determine whether their calls are observable; e.g. unnecessary zeroing might be considered dead only if proven to have no observable effect.\n\n- uintptr_t\n  - Used in the alignment check expression; needed to reason about the runtime alignment test and whether it can be constant for all callers/targets.\n\n- __builtin_bswap64\n  - Appears in the call graph (used by write macros or transform). Include it to understand whether _MHD_PUT_64BIT_BE or transform expands to calls with side effects; also to see whether transformations introduce observable behaviour.\n\nRationale summary: The dead\u2011code rule assessment requires knowing which branches and stores are ever observed by the rest of the program or by external effects. That depends on data structure layout, compile\u2011time macro choices, sizes/alignments, the precise behavior of sha512_256_transform, and how callers supply buffers. The listed symbols are the minimal items needed to decide whether each executed operation in MHD_SHA512_256_finish could be removed without changing program behaviour."
