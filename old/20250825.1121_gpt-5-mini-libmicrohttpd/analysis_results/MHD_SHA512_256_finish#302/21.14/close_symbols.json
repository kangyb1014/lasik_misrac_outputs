  "explanation": "For assessing the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null-terminated strings we must be able to see whether any comparisons of C strings (NUL-terminated) occur or whether only fixed-length binary buffers are handled. Each listed symbol is needed as follows:\n\n- struct Sha512_256Ctx: The full structure definition is required to know the types/semantics of the fields (buffer, count, count_bits_hi, H) and to determine whether any of them are NUL-terminated C strings or fixed-length binary buffers.\n- ctx->buffer: Inspecting the buffer object is necessary to know whether it holds binary block data (no terminating NUL) or a C string; this affects whether memcmp use would be comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n- ctx->count: Used to compute byte/bit counts \u2014 needed to show that data lengths are tracked explicitly (binary data), not string lengths.\n- ctx->count_bits_hi: High bits of processed-bit counter \u2014 confirms length accounting is numeric and for binary data.\n- ctx->H: The internal hash state array; required to see how final digest bytes are produced and that they are fixed-length binary words, not strings.\n- SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE: Size of the digest in bytes \u2014 required to show digest is a fixed-length byte array, not a NUL-terminated string.\n- SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE_WORDS: Word count of digest \u2014 used in allocation/temporary arrays; helps confirm fixed binary size.\n- SHA512_256_BYTES_IN_WORD: Byte size of a digest word \u2014 used to place 64-bit words in the output buffer; confirms binary layout.\n- SHA512_256_BLOCK_SIZE: Block size for padding logic \u2014 required to show buffer processing is block-oriented (binary), not string-oriented.\n- SHA512_256_SIZE_OF_LEN_ADD: Number of bytes reserved for length field \u2014 confirms padding and explicit length encoding (binary processing).\n- SHA512_256_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS: Word-indexing into buffer used for placing length words \u2014 confirms fixed-layout binary placement.\n- sha512_256_transform: The internal block transform is called on ctx->buffer; its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not call memcmp on strings or produce/consume NUL-terminated strings.\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_BE: Macro/function that writes 64-bit words as big-endian bytes into buffers; needed to confirm it writes fixed binary bytes (not building strings) and does not use memcmp on strings.\n- _MHD_PUT_64BIT_BE_UNALIGNED: Configuration symbol that changes output code-paths; affects which writing routine is used, so it must be known to ensure no string comparisons occur in alternate paths.\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: Compile-time option that selects different code paths; needed to know which branch is active and therefore which routines/macros are used (and whether any of them use memcmp on strings).\n- _MHD_UINT64_ALIGN: Alignment constant used to decide whether to use a temporary aligned buffer; necessary to see whether memcpy/memset paths create any accidental NUL-terminated strings.\n- memcpy: The function used to copy the final digest to the caller-provided buffer; its usage must be examined to ensure it's copying fixed-length bytes (binary), not being misused to compare or handle C strings.\n- memset: Used for zero-padding and sensitive-data erasure; examine to ensure it is applied to binary buffers, not string-termination semantics.\n- uint8_t / uint64_t: Fundamental integer types used in buffer and digest representations; required to confirm the code deals in bytes/words rather than char/string semantics.\n- uintptr_t: Used in alignment checks of digest pointer; required to determine alignment branch selection which changes how the digest is written (temporary aligned buffer vs direct write).\n- __builtin_bswap64: Compiler builtin called in transform; included because it is in the call graph and to confirm no string-comparison semantics are introduced by transform.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let the analyzer determine (a) whether the function or any callees perform memcmp-style comparisons, (b) whether the buffers involved are fixed-length binary data (hash state, digest, internal buffer) or NUL-terminated strings, and (c) which compile-time/configuration branches are taken that might introduce string operations. Only with these symbols can one reliably conclude whether the MISRA prohibition (using memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings) is relevant to this function and its callees."
