  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.17 applies to uses of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) that may access beyond object bounds. The code fragment contains several calls to functions that are likely to allocate or initialize response data and response objects (init_response_body_data, create_response_object, MHD_destroy_response) and manipulates buffers (body_dyn) and the resps array; these are the points that should be inspected because those functions or operations may internally call string.h routines or pass pointers/lengths to them. The other parts of the function are simple integer assignments, flag checks, fprintf calls with string literals, arithmetic for num_resps, return statements, and NULL checks \u2014 none of these directly invoke string.h functions nor pass buffers to them, so they do not need investigation for Rule 21.17. Note: the for/while index logic and allocation/free patterns are included above because they can affect validity of pointers/indices that may later be used with string functions; other statements (e.g., setting body_dyn_size, computing num_resps from get_num_threads/get_cpu_core_count) are plain arithmetic and control flow and are not relevant to Rule 21.17."
