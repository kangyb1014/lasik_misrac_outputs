  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. In the provided code the only direct use of a <string.h> function is the memset call inside MHD_pool_deallocate. That memset must be investigated to ensure the passed block pointer and block_size do not cause out-of-bounds access; therefore the two call sites in MHD_response_execute_upgrade_ that pass connection->write_buffer/connection->write_buffer_size and connection->read_buffer/connection->read_buffer_size to MHD_pool_deallocate are also included for review. No other occurrences of memcpy, memmove, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn are present in the supplied code. Other pointer arithmetic and allocation calls (MHD_pool_allocate, assignments to urh->in_buffer/out_buffer, use of calloc/free, and internal macros like _MHD_POISON_MEMORY/_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) do not invoke <string.h> functions and therefore are not directly relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
