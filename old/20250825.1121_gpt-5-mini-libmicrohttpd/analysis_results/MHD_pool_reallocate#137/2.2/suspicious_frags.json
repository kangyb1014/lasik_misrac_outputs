  "explanation": "The fragments above are calls or macro definitions that, per the provided additional definitions, expand to no-ops (mhd_assert, _MHD_POISON_MEMORY, _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) or are used only inside those no-op assertions (mp_ptr_le_). Those are suspicious because they are executed in source but, given the macro definitions, have no effect on program behaviour and therefore merit investigation for possible dead code.\n\nOther code fragments were not included because they perform observable actions or affect control flow and therefore are unlikely to be dead:\n- Memory writes and clears (memset calls) modify program-visible memory and cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n- memcpy that moves data to the newly allocated block changes memory contents and is executable behaviour.\n- Updates to pool->pos, calculations of asize and new_apos, and the related checks (if tests, returns) affect control flow and allocation bookkeeping; removing them would change program behaviour.\n- The ROUND_TO_ALIGN / ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE uses and size/overflow checks participate in allocation-size computations; they are functional, not mere diagnostics.\n- The mp_ptr_diff_ macro is used to compute old_offset (used later), so it is not a no-op in this function and was not flagged.\n\nInvestigate the listed suspicious fragments to determine whether the no-op macro definitions are intentional for the target build or whether those statements constitute dead code that should be removed or guarded differently."
