  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 prohibits executed operations whose removal would not affect the program behaviour (i.e. true dead code) in the delivered project. The _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY invocations expand to a build-time instrumentation macro that in this configuration is a deliberate no-op ((void)0). Those calls are present as instrumentation hooks that have observable effects in other build configurations (ASAN/poisoning enabled). The presence of the no-op expansion in one configuration is an implementation detail of the configurable instrumentation and is not, in intent, dead code in the project as delivered across its supported configurations. In practice static analysers that enforce MISRA typically treat such configurable instrumentation macros specially (or require a documented deviation) rather than flagging every (void)0 expansion as a Rule 2.2 violation. If you must satisfy a strict Rule 2.2 check for this single configuration, you can either: (a) remove/guard the calls under the same conditional that enables the instrumentation so they do not expand to statements in no-instrument builds, or (b) document a formal deviation/justification (these calls are instrumentation hooks that are active in other configurations)."
