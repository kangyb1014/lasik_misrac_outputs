This is dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. With the provided headers mhd_assert is defined as ((void)0), so every mhd_assert(\u2026) statement in the function becomes a no-op expression statement that is executed but has no effect. Removing those statements would not change program behaviour, which fits MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2\u2019s definition of dead code. The only caveat is build/configuration: if the project as delivered actually uses a different definition of mhd_assert in some authorised build configurations (i.e. assertions can be enabled in some approved builds), then those occurrences are not dead for the project as a whole. Given the scenario as stated (mhd_assert fixed to ((void)0) in the provided headers), the report of a Rule 2.2 violation is correct."
