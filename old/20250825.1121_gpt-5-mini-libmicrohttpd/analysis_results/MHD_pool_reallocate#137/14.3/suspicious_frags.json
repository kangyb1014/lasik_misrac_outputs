  "explanation": "I selected all conditional (if) controlling expressions in the function because MISRA C Rule 14.3 concerns invariant controlling expressions. Other lines in the function are not controlling expressions (assignments, arithmetic, memory operations, returns, or calls such as memset/memcpy/_MHD_POISON_MEMORY/_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY) and therefore are not relevant to Rule 14.3. The mhd_assert lines expand to a no-op in the provided configuration, so they do not introduce controlling statements to be checked. There are no loop (for/while/do) or switch controlling expressions in the function besides the listed if-statements, so no other fragments need investigation for invariance under Rule 14.3."
