  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is required to determine whether the code uses any compiler language extensions (as prohibited by the MISRA rule) rather than only standard C features: \n\n- sysconf: This is the function called. You must see its declaration and provenance (typically from unistd.h) to determine whether this is a standard C library call or a POSIX/platform extension, or if it is implemented as a compiler intrinsic/extension on the target toolchain. That affects whether the use constitutes a language/implementation extension. \n\n- _SC_IOV_MAX: This macro is passed to sysconf. Knowing its definition and origin is necessary to decide whether it is a standard symbol or an implementation-specific extension macro. \n\n- IOV_MAX: The conditional compilation depends on this macro. You must locate its definition (limits.h, sys/uio.h, or platform headers) to see if it is a standardized macro or a platform/implementation extension introduced by headers or feature-test macros. \n\n- mhd_iov_max_: The global variable assigned here: its declaration (type, linkage, any attributes) in the TU or linked headers must be inspected to ensure it does not use compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, attributes, or nonstandard types (which would be language/compiler extensions). Also to verify the cast (unsigned long) is compatible and standard for that variable. \n\n- unistd.h: This is the usual header providing sysconf and _SC_* macros. Inspecting which headers are included in the translation unit determines whether the code relies on POSIX headers (library/platform extensions) rather than strictly standard C headers. \n\n- limits.h (or sys/uio.h): IOV_MAX (if present) typically comes from limits.h or sys/uio.h on some platforms. Knowing which header supplies it (and whether that header is standard or platform-specific) is needed to judge extension usage. \n\n- feature-test macros (_POSIX_C_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE, _GNU_SOURCE): These macros can enable nonstandard or extended API exposure from headers. Their presence/value in the TU or build defines can mean the code is intentionally using extensions; they must be known to classify the usage. \n\n- compiler predefined macros (__GNUC__, __clang__, _MSC_VER, etc.): If the TU or build system defines compiler-specific macros (or if attributes/builtins are used elsewhere in the TU), the file may use compiler extensions conditionally. Knowing which compiler macros are active helps detect uses of language/compiler extensions that could make this function non-conforming.\n\nYou do not need the standard C types (long, unsigned long) because they are language-standard; the above symbols determine whether any nonstandard or implementation-specific features are being used in or affecting this function."
