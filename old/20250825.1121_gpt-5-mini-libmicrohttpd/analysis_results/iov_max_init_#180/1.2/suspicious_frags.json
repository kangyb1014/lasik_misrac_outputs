  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __inline (implementation-specific), statement-expressions ({ ... }), or other non\u2011standard keywords.\n- There is no inline assembly, nested functions, zero-length arrays, or other known compiler extensions present.\n- Preprocessor usage (#if defined(IOV_MAX), #else, #endif) and the cast (unsigned long)res are standard C and not language extensions.\n- The calls/macros present (sysconf, _SC_IOV_MAX, IOV_MAX) are POSIX/system library interfaces or macros, not compiler language extensions. Per your instruction, only compiler-documented language extensions should be reported.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. (Note: the additional snippet 'static unsigned long mhd_iov_max_ = 0' in the additional code appears to be missing a trailing semicolon, but that is a syntax issue, not a compiler language-extension.)"
