  "explanation": "I examined the provided function iov_max_init_ and the related symbol mhd_iov_max_. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The target function contains no calls to any of those functions, does not manipulate character buffers or pointer parameters related to string handling, and only calls sysconf and assigns a numeric value (with an unsigned long cast). Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied snippet that could violate Rule 21.17. If there are other files or functions (not provided) that call string.h functions, those would need to be reviewed separately; but within the given code no string handling usage exists and no further investigation for Rule 21.17 is required."
