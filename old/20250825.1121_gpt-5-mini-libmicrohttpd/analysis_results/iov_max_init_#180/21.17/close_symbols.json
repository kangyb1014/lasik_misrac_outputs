  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed:\n- mhd_iov_max_: The target function only assigns this global; to determine whether that assignment can lead to out-of-bounds string.h calls you must inspect its declaration (type, signedness) and every place it is read/used as a buffer size, index, or parameter to string functions.\n- sysconf: The function obtains the value via sysconf; knowing sysconf's prototype and documented return range/semantics is necessary to reason about possible values (including large or negative results) that are stored in mhd_iov_max_.\n- _SC_IOV_MAX: Identifies the sysconf query being made. Its meaning may affect the expected range of values returned and whether special handling is required.\n- IOV_MAX: The compile-time fallback used when sysconf fails. Its numeric value determines the bound stored in mhd_iov_max_ in that path and therefore affects any subsequent string.h calls that use that bound.\n- MHD_send_init_static_vars_: A direct caller of iov_max_init_. This function should be inspected to see how/when mhd_iov_max_ is used after initialization (particularly whether it is passed to string.h functions or used to size buffers).\n- MHD_init: Caller of MHD_send_init_static_vars_. Including the higher-level caller(s) helps follow the call chain to locations that may perform string operations influenced by mhd_iov_max_.\n- All functions/locations that use mhd_iov_max_ as a buffer length/array bound or pass it (or values derived from it) into any string.h functions: The MISRA rule is about preventing out-of-bounds accesses in string.h calls. To determine compliance you must inspect every use site where mhd_iov_max_ influences a pointer/length argument to those functions.\n- Declarations/usages of the standard string.h functions invoked with sizes or pointers that could be influenced by mhd_iov_max_: For each such invocation you must see the exact parameters (pointer/length), the objects involved, and their sizes to check for potential accesses beyond object bounds.\n\nIn short: besides the small set of macros/functions used to compute the value, the critical symbols are the mhd_iov_max_ declaration and every place in the codebase where that value flows into string.h calls or buffer sizing \u2014 those sites must be examined to decide MISRA compliance."
