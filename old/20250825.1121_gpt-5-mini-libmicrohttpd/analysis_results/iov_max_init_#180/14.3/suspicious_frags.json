  "explanation": "No C controlling expressions in the provided function are syntactically invariant. The only C control statement is\n- if (res >= 0)\nwhich depends on the runtime value returned by sysconf(_SC_IOV_MAX) (res) and therefore is not an invariant controlling expression. There are no while/for/do-while/switch controlling expressions present.\n\nThe preprocessor conditional (#if defined(IOV_MAX)) and the constant initialiser for the static variable are evaluated at translation/preprocessing time and are not C-language controlling expressions covered by MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.3; they therefore do not constitute violations of this rule. Consequently, there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 14.3 in the supplied code."
