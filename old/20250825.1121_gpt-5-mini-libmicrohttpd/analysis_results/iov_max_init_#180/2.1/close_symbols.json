  "explanation": "sysconf \u2014 The runtime outcome of the sysconf call (possible return values and error behaviour) determines whether the 'if (res >= 0)' branch or the runtime 'else' branch can be taken; needed to decide if either branch is truly unreachable at runtime.\n\n_SC_IOV_MAX \u2014 The symbolic argument passed to sysconf; its presence/definition and semantics affect whether sysconf is meaningful on the target platform (and therefore whether the runtime branches are reachable).\n\nIOV_MAX \u2014 This macro is tested by the preprocessor (#if defined(IOV_MAX)). Whether IOV_MAX is defined at compile time determines which of the #if/#else alternate assignments is actually present in the compiled translation unit; a missing/defined IOV_MAX can make one of the source alternatives compile out (i.e. be unreachable in the translation unit).\n\nmhd_iov_max_ \u2014 The global being assigned; knowing its declaration/linkage/usage helps determine whether the assignments performed here are ever observable or used (if the whole function is never called the assignments are effectively dead/unreachable), and whether any compiler/linker optimizations could remove code.\n\nMHD_send_init_static_vars_ and MHD_init \u2014 The callers in the static call graph. To decide whether this function itself (and therefore all its statements) is reachable in the program you must know whether these callers are themselves reachable/used; include these symbols (and their call sites) to determine if iov_max_init_ can ever be invoked from program entry points."
