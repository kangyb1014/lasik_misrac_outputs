  "explanation": "To decide if this function violates the MISRA rule about pointers being const-qualified, the analyser must be able to determine whether any of the names used are pointer types and whether they carry const. For that you need:\n\n- mhd_iov_max_: the declaration/type of this symbol (global/static). The key question is whether mhd_iov_max_ is an integer (e.g. unsigned long) or a pointer type (e.g. unsigned long *). If it is a pointer the analyser must check whether it is declared pointing-to-const where appropriate.\n\n- sysconf: the function prototype (return type and parameter types). sysconf returns a long (not a pointer) in POSIX, so confirming its signature proves that the value handled here is not a pointer and therefore not subject to the pointer-to-const rule in this context.\n\n- _SC_IOV_MAX: the macro/constant used as sysconf argument. Confirming its definition is required to ensure no surprising macro expands to something involving pointers (very unlikely but must be checked to be sure no pointer types are introduced).\n\n- IOV_MAX: the fallback macro used in the #if branch. Its definition must be inspected to confirm it is an integer macro (not a pointer expression) and thus does not introduce pointer usage that would be subject to the MISRA pointer-to-const rule.\n\nIf all of the above are non-pointer integer types/definitions, the target function contains no pointers and therefore cannot violate the MISRA rule about pointer constness. If any of the above are pointer types, the declaration will show whether the pointed-to type is const-qualified."
