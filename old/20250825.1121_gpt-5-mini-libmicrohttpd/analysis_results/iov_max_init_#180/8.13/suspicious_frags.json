  "explanation": "No pointer declarations, pointer parameters, pointer return types, pointer casts, or pointer assignments are present in the provided code fragments. The function signature is static void iov_max_init_(void) (no pointer parameters), sysconf returns a long (not a pointer), and mhd_iov_max_ is a static unsigned long (not a pointer). The preprocessor branches (IOV_MAX) and integer casts ((unsigned long) res) involve integer values, not pointers. Therefore there are no code locations relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer const-qualification) to investigate."
