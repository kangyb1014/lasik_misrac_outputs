  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 because the rule concerns modification of function parameters (and pointer parameters themselves). The function iov_max_init_ has no parameters (signature: void). All modifications in the function are to a local variable (res) and to a static global variable (mhd_iov_max_), neither of which are function parameters. The call to sysconf passes a macro constant (_SC_IOV_MAX) and merely assigns its return value to a local long; no pointer or parameter of iov_max_init_ is modified. The conditional branches assign constant values (IOV_MAX or 8) to the global variable, which is outside the scope of Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that violate or need investigation under Rule 17.8."
