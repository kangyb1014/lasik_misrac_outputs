  "explanation": "mhd_iov_max_: The function assigns to this identifier. To decide whether the assignment modifies a function parameter (which would violate the MISRA rule) you must know how this identifier is declared/defined (global variable, file-static, or a macro that could expand to a parameter or to code that modifies a parameter). sysconf: The call to sysconf(...) passes an argument and returns a value used to assign mhd_iov_max_. Knowing the prototype/signature of sysconf confirms that no parameter of the target function is involved or being modified and ensures the call itself does not implicitly alter any parameter of this function. _SC_IOV_MAX: This macro is passed to sysconf; its definition is needed to confirm it is a compile-time constant (not an expression that could reference or expand to a function parameter or lvalue affecting this function). IOV_MAX: Used in the fallback branch under the preprocessor check. Its definition is required to determine whether it is a simple integer constant (harmless) or a macro/identifier that could expand to code that affects a parameter. Together these symbols let an analyzer verify that the target function makes only assignments to a known object (or simple constants) and does not modify any of its own parameters (it has none)."
