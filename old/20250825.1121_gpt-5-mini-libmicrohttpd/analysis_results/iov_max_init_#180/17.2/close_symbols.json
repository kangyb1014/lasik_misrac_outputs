  "explanation": "To determine whether iov_max_init_ participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect the call graph beyond the function itself: \n\n- MHD_send_init_static_vars_: This function is a direct caller of iov_max_init_ (per the static call graph). Its body must be examined to see whether it (or any functions it calls) can call back into iov_max_init_, forming an indirect recursion cycle.\n\n- MHD_init: This function is a caller of MHD_send_init_static_vars_. The analysis must follow caller chains upward to ensure there is no path from MHD_init (or functions it calls) back to iov_max_init_. Including MHD_init ensures the call chain is explored far enough to detect cycles.\n\n- sysconf: iov_max_init_ calls this library/system function. Although unlikely, a thorough recursion check should confirm that sysconf (or functions it can cause to run in the runtime/library) does not re-enter application code and eventually call iov_max_init_. Including sysconf closes that possible indirect path.\n\nNo data symbols (mhd_iov_max_, IOV_MAX) are required for detecting recursion because the MISRA rule concerns call relationships, not data usage."
