  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for checking the memcmp MISRA rule in the target function:\n\n- sysconf: The target calls sysconf. To be certain the target function itself does not invoke memcmp indirectly, the implementation or wrapper for sysconf (or its prototype/macros) must be inspected to ensure it does not call memcmp or expand to code that compares strings with memcmp.\n\n- _SC_IOV_MAX: This macro is passed to sysconf. Inspecting its definition ensures it is a compile-time integer constant (not a macro that expands to code containing memcmp or string comparisons).\n\n- IOV_MAX: This conditional fallback macro is used when sysconf fails. Its definition must be checked to confirm it is an integer constant, not a macro or expression that could perform string comparisons using memcmp.\n\n- mhd_iov_max_: The left-hand-side of the assignments; its definition (variable vs. macro) and type must be checked to ensure it is not a macro/function-like entity that could expand to code using memcmp.\n\n- unistd.h: Header that typically provides the prototype for sysconf and the _SC_* macros. Inspecting the header ensures that nothing unexpected (macros or inline wrappers) introduces memcmp usage.\n\n- limits.h (or the header that defines IOV_MAX on the target platform): Needed to locate the IOV_MAX definition to verify it is a simple constant and not an expression or macro that does string comparisons.\n\n- MHD_send_init_static_vars_ (caller/transunit): Although the MISRA rule is about use inside the target function, checking the caller\u2019s translation unit helps ensure there are no preprocessor tricks (e.g., macro redefinitions) that alter the meaning of symbols used in iov_max_init_. This ensures the target code as compiled does not get transformed into code that uses memcmp.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/implementations of all functions, macros and globals referenced by iov_max_init_ (and the headers/translation units that define them) to be sure none expand or call into code that uses memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings."
