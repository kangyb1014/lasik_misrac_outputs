  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function iov_max_init_ contains no calls to memcmp and performs only numeric operations: calling sysconf, assigning the resulting long to an unsigned long, and selecting a compile-time macro (IOV_MAX) or a literal constant (8). There are no character pointers, no string operations, and no comparisons of null-terminated strings using memcmp in the provided code or the related symbol definition (static unsigned long mhd_iov_max_ = 0). Therefore Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) is not applicable to any fragment in the given code."
