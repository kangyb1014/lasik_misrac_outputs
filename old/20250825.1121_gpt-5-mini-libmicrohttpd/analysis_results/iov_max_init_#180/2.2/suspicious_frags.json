The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Fragments not selected as suspicious were left out because they are either conditional-compilation stubs (not executed unless particular build-time macros are set), clearly necessary initialization calls, or assertions/initializations that are not candidates for MISRA Rule 2.2 dead-code testing: - Code within #ifdef / #if blocks that depend on build-time macros is not executed unless those macros are set; such code is either reachable in some configurations or is unreachable at runtime (unreachable code is explicitly excluded by the rule notes). Removing these build-time guarded blocks would change behaviour in the configurations where the macros are set. - Simple initialization/initialiser calls (e.g. setting up global subsystems, network startup, library initialisation) are likely to affect runtime behaviour and therefore are not considered dead code without further evidence. - Declarations and initializations that are performed as part of module setup (for example struct declarations used only inside asserts) are not the same as redundant assignments (see rule notes). The selected fragments were chosen because they represent operations that are executed in normal builds (or could be executed) but include constructs that are potentially removable without changing observable behaviour (for example the unconditional if (1) wrapper around the debug assert, the static helper function and its fallback assignments, or multiple alternative platform-specific thread-init calls). These should be investigated to determine whether they are truly necessary or constitute dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
