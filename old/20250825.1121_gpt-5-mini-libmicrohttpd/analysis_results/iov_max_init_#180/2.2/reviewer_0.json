  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. MISRA Rule 2.2 requires proof that an executed operation can be removed without changing program behaviour. Agent A points out that in one particular build configuration MHD_send_init_static_vars_ becomes an empty body and the call MHD_send_init_static_vars_(); in MHD_init executes but appears to \u2018do nothing\u2019. However: (a) an executed function call, even if it contains no observable state changes, can affect timing or other timing\u2011sensitive behaviour of an embedded system (see Note 1 to Rule 2.2). Removing the call could therefore change program behaviour, so you cannot conclude it is dead code without further analysis. (b) The iov_max_init_ function itself is only invoked under the conditional compile (HAVE_SYSCONF && _SC_IOV_MAX); the mere presence of the function definition in the translation unit does not automatically imply a Rule 2.2 violation \u2014 to show dead code you must show that the operation is executed in the build and that removing it would have no effect. If, conversely, the function is truly never referenced and never executed in the delivered build (and its removal would not affect timing/behaviour), then it would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2 \u2014 but Agent A did not provide that proof. For these reasons the claim as presented is not proven and is therefore incorrect."
