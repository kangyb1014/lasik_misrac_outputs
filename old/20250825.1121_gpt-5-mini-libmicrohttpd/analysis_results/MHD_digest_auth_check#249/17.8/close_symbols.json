  "explanation": "- MHD_digest_auth_check2: The target function only forwards its parameters to MHD_digest_auth_check2. To determine whether any of the parameter variables are modified (directly or via a macro expansion), you must inspect the exact definition or macro expansion for MHD_digest_auth_check2. If it is a macro/inline that expands into code in the caller, that expansion could assign to the local parameter identifiers; if it is a function, its body cannot change the caller's parameter variables but a macro could. Also check its prototype to verify argument types. \n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: This token is passed as an argument; if it is a macro rather than a simple constant, its expansion might introduce code that modifies caller parameters (or otherwise changes semantics). Include its definition to be sure it is a harmless constant expression. \n- MHD_EXTERN: This storage-class macro can expand to attributes/inline/extern definitions that may alter how the function is declared/compiled (e.g., turning it into a macro/inline). Inspecting its definition ensures the target function body is exactly as presented and not subject to preprocessing that could modify parameter identifiers. \n- struct MHD_Connection: The parameter type definition is needed to rule out unusual preprocessor/type tricks (e.g., if the type is a macro that expands into something that changes parameter declarations) and to fully understand whether any operations in expanded code could act on the pointer value itself."
