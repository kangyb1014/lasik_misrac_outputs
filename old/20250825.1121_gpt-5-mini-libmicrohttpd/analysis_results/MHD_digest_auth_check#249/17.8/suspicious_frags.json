  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The body simply forwards all parameters to MHD_digest_auth_check2 and supplies an extra constant argument (MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5). There are no assignments to any parameter variables, no increments/decrements, and no reassignments of pointer parameters. The pointer parameters are declared as pointers to const char, so the pointed-to objects cannot be modified here. Passing parameters by value (including nonce_timeout) to another function does not constitute modification of the parameters themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
