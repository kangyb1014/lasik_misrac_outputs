Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- MHD_digest_auth_check2: the wrapper simply forwards to this function. To decide if the wrapper is dead (removal has no effect) you must inspect the callee\u2019s behaviour and reachable code paths.\n- MHD_digest_auth_check3: called (transitively) by MHD_digest_auth_check2 in the static graph; its behaviour or side-effects can determine whether the wrapper is required.\n- __builtin_unreachable: appears in the callee chain; note MISRA\u2019s distinction between unreachable and dead code. You must see whether this builtin is actually reachable at runtime (affects whether portions are dead vs simply unreachable).\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: the constant passed by the wrapper may select a code path or behaviour in downstream functions; its definition (macro/enum) and semantic effect must be known to judge whether the wrapper\u2019s argument changes program behaviour.\n- MHD_EXTERN (macro/visibility): determines linkage/visibility (exported API). If the symbol is part of the public API (externally visible), removing it could affect program behaviour outside the translation unit; visibility must be known to decide dead code.\n- All callers / references of MHD_digest_auth_check: to prove dead code you must show that no internal or external code calls it or takes its address (including callbacks, function-pointer tables, tests, or other modules). Every reference must be enumerated.\n- Linker/export metadata that exposes MHD_digest_auth_check: symbol export lists, version scripts, or .def files can make the function part of the public ABI even if no internal callers exist; such external exposure prevents removal without changing behaviour.\n\nCollecting and analyzing these symbols/metadata lets you determine reachability, side-effects, external visibility, and thus whether removing MHD_digest_auth_check would alter program behaviour (i.e. whether it is dead code per MISRA)."
