  "explanation": "MHD_digest_auth_check2: The target function is a simple forwarder; all real string comparisons (and any memcmp usage) will be in MHD_digest_auth_check2, so its body is required to determine if memcmp is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nMHD_digest_auth_check3: MHD_digest_auth_check2 calls MHD_digest_auth_check3 (per the static call graph). Any memcmp use or length calculations inside that callee can be part of the overall behavior; include it to follow the full call chain where an offending memcmp might occur.\n\nmemcmp: The MISRA rule specifically targets use of the Standard Library function memcmp for comparing null\u2011terminated strings. The presence, argument shapes, and how its length argument is computed must be inspected, so the memcmp symbol (and its call sites) must be available.\n\nstrlen: A common pattern that violates the rule is computing a length with strlen and then calling memcmp with that length. To detect this idiom you must see usages of strlen (or other length computations) in the same call sites as memcmp, so include strlen to determine whether memcmp is effectively being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nMHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: The forwarded constant passed by MHD_digest_auth_check could alter control flow inside the deeper functions (selecting code paths that do or do not call memcmp). Include the constant so the analyzer can determine which branches are relevant for the call from MHD_digest_auth_check.\n\nNotes: __builtin_unreachable is present in the call graph but is a compiler builtin affecting control flow; it does not itself cause memcmp misuse and need not be included unless its presence in a specific branch affects whether a memcmp call is reachable for the given forwarding arguments."
