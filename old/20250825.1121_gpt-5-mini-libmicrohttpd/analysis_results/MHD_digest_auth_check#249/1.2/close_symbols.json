  "explanation": "To determine whether the target wrapper uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect symbols that materially affect the function signature or call site after preprocessing: \n\n- _MHD_EXTERN: This macro prefixes the function definition. Its expansion can introduce compiler-specific storage-class keywords or attribute syntax (for example __attribute__((...)), __declspec(...), visibility pragmas, or other compiler extensions). Inspecting its definition is required to decide if an extension is being used.\n\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: This macro/constant is passed as an argument. Its definition could use non-standard constructs (macro tricks, castings, GCC extensions, or compound literals) that would violate the MISRA prohibition on language extensions. Check its expansion/type.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_check2: The wrapper simply calls this function. Its prototype or definition may include extension usage in its declaration (attributes, GCC function-specifiers, non-standard calling conventions, or variadic/inline/asm uses). You must examine the declaration/definition to determine whether the call site or signature relies on language extensions.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function parameter type is a pointer to this struct. Although only a pointer is used here, the full type definition (in headers) could contain compiler-specific extensions (bit-field extensions, anonymous structs/unions, alignment pragmas, attribute annotations). Inspecting the type definition ensures no extensions are hidden there.\n\n(Inspect the header(s) where these macros/types/functions are defined to see their expansions/declarations; the wrapper body itself is trivial, so any violation would come from these symbols.)"
