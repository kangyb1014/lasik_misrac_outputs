  "explanation": "- MHD_digest_auth_check2: The target function is a trivial wrapper that forwards all parameters to MHD_digest_auth_check2. To determine whether any string.h function is used in a way that can read/write past buffer bounds, the body of MHD_digest_auth_check2 must be inspected.\n- MHD_digest_auth_check3: The static call graph shows MHD_digest_auth_check2 calls MHD_digest_auth_check3. Any string operations (or buffer handling) may occur in that deeper callee, so its implementation must also be analyzed for out-of-bounds accesses.\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: The wrapper passes this constant into MHD_digest_auth_check2. Its value or type could change control flow or selected code paths (e.g., algorithm-specific branches) inside the callees; to know which code paths to inspect you must know this symbol.\n- struct MHD_Connection: The connection object is passed through; its layout and relevant fields (pointers/lengths/buffers) may be used by the callees when operating on strings/buffers. Understanding its definition is necessary to judge whether pointer/length uses are safe.\n- string.h functions used by the callees (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, strcmp): The MISRA rule targets standard string.h calls. You must locate every use of these functions (or equivalent manual byte operations) in MHD_digest_auth_check2 / MHD_digest_auth_check3 (and any further callees they invoke) to verify correct sizes/limits and absence of accesses beyond object bounds."
