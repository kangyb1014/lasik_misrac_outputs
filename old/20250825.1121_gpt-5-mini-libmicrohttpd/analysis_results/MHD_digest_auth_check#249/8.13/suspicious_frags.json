  "explanation": "The only pointer parameter in this function that is not const-qualified is 'struct MHD_Connection *connection', so it should be investigated to determine whether it can be made 'const struct MHD_Connection *' per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The other parameters do not need investigation: 'realm', 'username', and 'password' are already 'const char *'; 'nonce_timeout' is an unsigned integer (not a pointer); the return type is an int (not a pointer); and the macro 'MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5' is not a pointer. The call to MHD_digest_auth_check2 passing 'connection' is included because the callee's expectations may affect whether 'connection' can be const-qualified here."
