  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA C (controlling expressions shall not be invariant) analysis:\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_check2: The target function is a trivial wrapper that delegates to this function. Although the wrapper itself has no control statements, the callee\u2019s implementation may contain conditional/loop controlling expressions that depend on the constant argument passed here. To be certain the wrapper does not indirectly introduce or rely on an invariant controlling expression (via a constant parameter), the full definition of MHD_digest_auth_check2 must be inspected.\n\n- MHD_DIGEST_ALG_MD5: This is the constant literal passed as the last argument. Its value (macro/enum) may make certain branches or loops in the callee invariant (for example selecting a code path that never changes). The exact definition is needed to determine if passing this specific constant produces an invariant controlling expression in the callee.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_check3: It is called by MHD_digest_auth_check2 (callee-of-callee). Control expressions that become invariant might occur deeper in the call chain; therefore the next-level callee must be examined to find any invariant controlling expressions that originate from the constant parameter or other wrapper effects.\n\n- __builtin_unreachable: Present in the callee\u2019s call graph. Use of this intrinsic often accompanies control-flow assumptions (e.g., after a switch or if that is assumed exhaustive). Its presence can indicate deliberate invariants or unreachable branches \u2014 relevant to deciding whether a controlling expression is invariant or intentionally used to create an infinite/never-taken path allowed by MISRA exceptions.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The connection argument is passed through the wrapper to the callee(s). The callee\u2019s control expressions may depend on fields of this struct; the struct definition (or at least the fields used by the callee\u2019s conditions) is required to judge whether any controlling expressions are invariant for all sensible values or become invariant due to how the wrapper passes/initializes the pointer.\n\nNote: The wrapper itself contains no control statements, so the primary check is whether the constant argument or passed connection causes invariant controlling expressions in MHD_digest_auth_check2 (or deeper). The listed symbols are the minimal additional items required to make that determination."
