  "explanation": "The listed fragments are the places where non-const pointers or addresses to non-const objects are introduced or used in a way that may be unnecessary: the function parameter cls is an unqualified void*, it is cast to a non-const struct handler_param*, a static object (aptr) is defined as a non-const int and its address is stored in the request-class pointer, and the req_cls parameter is a void** (modified and used to hold &aptr). Other pointers in the function are already const-qualified (const char *url, *method, *version, *upload_data; param->response_page is declared const), and calls such as MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static accept a const void * buffer, so they do not raise issues under Rule 8.13. The (void) unused casts, response handling and enum usage do not affect pointer const-qualification and thus were not included."
