  "explanation": "No function parameter itself is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. The only mutations are to the object pointed to by the pointer parameter req_cls (lines: \u2018*req_cls = &aptr;\u2019 and \u2018*req_cls = NULL;\u2019). MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter; it only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself (e.g. doing \u2018req_cls = \u2026\u2019), which does not occur. The (void) casts do not modify parameters, the cast from void *cls to a local pointer \u2018param\u2019 merely creates a local alias and does not modify cls, and no other parameter assignments are present. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation."
