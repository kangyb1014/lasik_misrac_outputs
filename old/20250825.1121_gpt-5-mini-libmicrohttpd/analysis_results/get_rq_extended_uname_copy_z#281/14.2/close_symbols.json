The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning (concise) for including each symbol when checking MISRA C \"for loop well-formed\" rule for the target function:\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: Called before the loop; we must confirm it has no persistent side effects (no modification of memory or globals that could act as a loop counter or control flag used later). Also check it does not indirectly modify objects used in loop conditions (e.g. uname_ext, uname_ext_len).\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: Macro/utility used to compute the initial value of r. Needed to see exact expansion/value so we can determine the initialisation of the variable used in the loop condition and ensure no hidden side effects occur in its expansion.\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_PREFIX: The constant/string whose length is used to initialize r. Knowing its exact value/representation clarifies r's initial value for the loop-condition analysis.\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN: Used in an early check on uname_ext_len. Needed to confirm that earlier checks cannot hide side effects or alter conditions relevant to loop variables.\n\n- SSIZE_MAX: Used in the initial bounds check/cast. Include it to ensure that the size/type checks do not rely on side-effecting macros or functions and to validate the cast/limit semantics that affect loop-variable ranges.\n\n- MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_: Called after the loop; required to inspect because MISRA requires considering the behaviour of functions called within loop statements or that might be used as loop control in other contexts. We must confirm it does not modify objects used as loop counters or the buffer in a way that could retroactively affect loop well-formedness or introduce side effects relevant to loop analysis.\n\n- toxdigitvalue: Callee of MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_. Included to fully cover the call chain for side effects \u2014 any function in the transitive call graph could have side effects affecting objects used as loop counters or flags.\n\n- mhd_assert: Assertion macro used after the loop. Macros can expand to expressions with side effects (or to nothing in non-debug builds); include it to ensure its expansion does not modify objects relevant to loop analysis.\n\nNotes: The actual loop in the target function is a while loop (not a for loop). To determine compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule in surrounding/related code or to be certain no hidden for-like behaviour is introduced via macros/callees, the above external symbols must be inspected for side effects, modifications of objects used in loop conditions (r, uname_ext_len, uname_ext), or modifications of global state that could serve as loop counters/flags."
