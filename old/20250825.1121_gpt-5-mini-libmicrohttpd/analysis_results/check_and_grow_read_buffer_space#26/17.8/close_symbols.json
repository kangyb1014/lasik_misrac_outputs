  "explanation": "To determine whether check_and_grow_read_buffer_space violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we must be sure the function does not modify the parameter variable c itself (reassign it). The following symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- try_grow_read_buffer (declaration/definition): This callee is invoked with c. Its prototype/signature must be checked to ensure it does not take a pointer-to-pointer (e.g. struct MHD_Connection **) or otherwise receive &c (which could modify the caller's c). Also its implementation should be checked to ensure it is not a macro that might reassign c.\n\n- has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer (declaration/definition): This callee is passed c; verify it does not accept a pointer-to-pointer nor is a macro that could assign to the caller's c.\n\n- handle_recv_no_space (declaration/definition): This callee is called with c and must be checked the same way (prototype and/or macro body) to ensure it cannot reassign the caller's c.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/definition): mhd_assert is used with expressions involving c. If it is a macro its expansion could (in principle) contain statements that modify c; the macro definition is needed to rule that out.\n\n- MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (macro/definition): This macro is invoked with (c->daemon). If it is a macro with side effects or unusual evaluation (or uses its argument in a way that could rebind c via & or assignment), its definition must be inspected to ensure it cannot modify the parameter variable c.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (type definition): The parameter type must be confirmed (that c is indeed declared as a simple pointer parameter and not as something unusual). The structure definition also clarifies which operations in the function are merely modifying the object pointed-to (allowed by the rule) versus any construct that might attempt to reassign the parameter itself.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyzer confirm that all uses of c are either permitted modifications of the pointee or are free of any constructs (macros/callees) that could reassign the parameter variable c itself."
