  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer in check_and_grow_read_buffer_space should be const-qualified we must know what is actually modified and what callees expect/modify:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): needed to see which members are written by this function (e.g. c->event_loop_info assignment) and which members are pointers. If the function writes any member of *c then the parameter cannot be const; the full type is required for that determination.\n\n- definition of the request sub-structure type used as c->rq (have_chunked_upload, remaining_upload_size, current_chunk_size, current_chunk_offset, http_mthd, req_target_len): the function reads many rq fields and callers/callees may modify them. Knowing the rq type lets us determine whether accesses here are read-only and whether any indirect writes occur (which affects const qualification of pointers to those sub-objects).\n\n- definition of the daemon type pointed by c->daemon (at least pool_increment): c->daemon is dereferenced for pool_increment; the type definition confirms whether that access is read-only and whether daemon is a pointer to mutable state that this function or callees might change.\n\n- prototype and implementation of try_grow_read_buffer: this function is called with c and may modify the connection (e.g. reallocate buffers, update read_buffer_size/offset). To know whether passing a non-const pointer is required (or whether try_grow_read_buffer could accept a const pointer), we must inspect its signature and body.\n\n- prototype and implementation of has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer: called with c to test buffer contents; its signature/body tell us whether it mutates c or could accept a const pointer.\n\n- prototype and implementation of handle_recv_no_space: this function is called when no space is available and almost certainly modifies the connection or closes it; its prototype and body are required to determine whether calling it forces the parameter to be non-const.\n\n- definition of MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ (macro/function): used in a branch condition; its definition is needed to see whether it modifies the daemon/connection or is purely read-only (affects constness reasoning).\n\n- declarations of the MHD_CONNECTION_* state enum and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_* flags: required to check which fields are tested/assigned and whether those assignments imply mutation of the connection object (affects whether a pointer must be non-const).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine (a) which objects are modified directly in this function, (b) which callees require mutable access to the connection, and therefore (c) whether any pointer parameters/fields could/should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
