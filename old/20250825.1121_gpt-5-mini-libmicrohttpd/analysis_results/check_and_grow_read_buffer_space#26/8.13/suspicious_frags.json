  "explanation": "I did not include other pointer uses because they clearly require a mutable (non-const) pointer or are not relevant to Rule 8.13: - All uses of struct MHD_Connection * (functions check_and_grow_read_buffer_space, try_grow_read_buffer, has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer, handle_recv_no_space, etc.) modify or rely on mutable connection state (fields are assigned or passed to functions that mutate state), so the parameter cannot be const-qualified. - MHD_pool_reallocate and the surrounding code actually reallocate/assign the read_buffer (rb = MHD_pool_reallocate(...); connection->read_buffer = rb; connection->read_buffer_size = new_size;), so the buffer pointer and related API must be non-const. - Calls that pass NULL (e.g. handle_req_headers_no_space (c, NULL, 0)) do not provide a readable data pointer to qualify constness. - Local variables of pointer type (e.g. void *rb) are assigned and used to update the connection; they must remain mutable. The fragments listed above are the places where a non-const pointer to the read buffer (connection->read_buffer) is passed to functions that plausibly only read from the buffer; these should be investigated to determine whether the callee prototypes (and thus the pointer types) could be const-qualified in accordance with MISRA C Rule 8.13."
