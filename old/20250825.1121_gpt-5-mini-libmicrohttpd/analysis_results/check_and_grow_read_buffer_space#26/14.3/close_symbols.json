  "explanation": "For determining whether any controlling expression in check_and_grow_read_buffer_space is invariant (constant) we must know which operands are compile-time constants and which are runtime-varying. The struct MHD_Connection definition (and its nested rq and daemon types) is required because almost every controlling expression reads fields from c (event_loop_info, discard_request, read_buffer_offset, read_buffer_size, state, and rq.*). Without the exact types/fields we cannot tell if those values are modifiable at runtime or are in fact constants or macros. The daemon type (pool_increment and any thread-related fields) is needed because pool_increment participates in the rbuff_grow_desired computation and MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ may inspect daemon state; if those are compile-time constants the expressions could be invariant. The rq sub-structure fields (have_chunked_upload, remaining_upload_size, current_chunk_size, current_chunk_offset, http_mthd, req_target_len) are used in several branches \u2014 their mutability and potential constant sentinel values (e.g. MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN) determine whether branches like the chunked/non-chunked checks can be constant. The various macro/constant values (MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ, MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_PROCESS, MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING, MHD_HTTP_MTHD_NO_METHOD, MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN, MHD_CHUNK_HEADER_REASONABLE_LEN and all MHD_CONNECTION_* enum values used in the switch) must be known so we can tell whether expressions such as (MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING == c->state) or bitwise tests against event_loop_info could be reduced to invariants. MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_ must be inspected to know whether that expression is a compile-time or run-time test. try_grow_read_buffer and has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer definitions/semantics are required because their return values and side effects influence subsequent conditions (e.g. early returns) and thus whether later controlling expressions are effectively constant in any execution path. handle_recv_no_space is included to verify it does not alter values that would make later conditions invariant, and mhd_assert's definition is needed to know whether assertions produce side effects or are removed (which could affect whether their conditions count as controlling expressions in some build configurations). Finally, the enum MHD_ProcRecvDataStage and MHD_PROC_RECV_* constants are needed to fully reason about the switch target values and whether any mapping there is constant. Together these symbols let an analyst determine if any controlling expression in this function is in fact invariant (violating MISRA) or depends on mutable/runtime data."
