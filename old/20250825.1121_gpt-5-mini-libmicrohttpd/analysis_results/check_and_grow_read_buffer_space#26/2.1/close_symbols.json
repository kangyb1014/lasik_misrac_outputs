  "explanation": "To determine whether any code paths in check_and_grow_read_buffer_space are unreachable you must understand all inputs, constants, called-function effects, and any assertions that can make branches impossible. The requested symbols are required for these reasons:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the function's branches and conditions directly read many fields (event_loop_info, discard_request, read_buffer_offset, read_buffer_size, daemon, state, rq). Without the precise field types, ranges and semantics you cannot decide whether particular conditional outcomes (and thus branches) are possible.\n\n- c->daemon (pool_increment): pool_increment participates in the rbuff_grow_desired calculation. Its type and range affect whether that condition can ever be true/false.\n\n- c->rq (request-related fields): have_chunked_upload, remaining_upload_size, current_chunk_size, current_chunk_offset, http_mthd, req_target_len all control nested branches (chunked vs normal body, header parsing, limits). Their types and permitted values determine reachability of inner blocks.\n\n- try_grow_read_buffer: the function's boolean return controls several subsequent control-flow decisions (immediate success, fallback paths). You must know when it can return true/false and whether it has side-effects (e.g., growing buffer) that affect later conditions.\n\n- has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer: its return value enables the branch that sets event_loop_info to PROCESS and returns true. Knowing when it can be true is necessary to know if the code that follows (the big switch/handle_recv_no_space) can be reached.\n\n- handle_recv_no_space: this call is reached when growth failed and no deferred processing is possible. If this function is noreturn (closes the connection or longjmps) some subsequent code paths in callers may be effectively unreachable; if it always returns you must analyze what it does. Its behaviour influences reachability reasoning.\n\n- mhd_assert: used several times (including mhd_assert(0) in default). Whether mhd_assert aborts in all builds or can be compiled out affects whether the default case (and subsequent code) is reachable or considered unreachable in practice.\n\n- MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_READ and MHD_EVENT_LOOP_INFO_PROCESS: these bitflags are read/modified and appear in assertions and branch tests; their definitions and mutual exclusivity rules can make some assertion checks always true/false.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_* enum (all enumerators used in the switch): the switch's cases cover many explicit states and a default with mhd_assert(0). To prove any case/default unreachable you must know the exhaustive set of possible c->state values and whether any states are impossible at the call site.\n\n- MHD_PROC_RECV_* enum: values passed to handle_recv_no_space; useful to confirm that stage selection code is reachable and meaningful (and whether some stage can never be selected because state/http_mthd/req_target_len combinations can never occur).\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_BODY_RECEIVING: used in several branch conditions; need its exact value/meaning relative to c->state.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_MTHD_NO_METHOD: used to choose stage in one branch (method vs URI); determine if that branch can be taken.\n\n- MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN: used to distinguish known/unknown remaining upload size; affects which path (and assertions) are active.\n\n- MHD_CHUNK_HEADER_REASONABLE_LEN: constant used to decide growth for next chunk size line; its numeric value relative to read_buffer_size affects that branch reachability.\n\n- MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_: used to decide whether to set PROCESS or call handle_recv_no_space; thread-usage semantics change branch feasibility (if always true/false for given daemon type some branches may be unreachable).\n\n- MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info and MHD_connection_handle_idle (callers/upstream): to determine call-site invariants (e.g., guaranteed state, buffer sizes, or event_loop_info) which can render certain branches in check_and_grow_read_buffer_space impossible. The static call graph shows these callers and they may establish preconditions that eliminate some cases.\n\nIn short, to prove or refute unreachable-code violations you need the concrete types, constants, call semantics and caller preconditions listed above so you can decide which boolean conditions and switch cases can actually occur at runtime. Without them the apparent dead branches may be either truly unreachable or reachable under some valid runtime states."
