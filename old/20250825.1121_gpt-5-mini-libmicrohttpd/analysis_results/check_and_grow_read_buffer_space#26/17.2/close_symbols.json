  "explanation": "Reason for including each symbol (needed to prove absence/presence of indirect recursion involving check_and_grow_read_buffer_space):\n\n- try_grow_read_buffer\n  - Direct callee of check_and_grow_read_buffer_space. Its body might call other functions that eventually call back to check_and_grow_read_buffer_space, forming indirect recursion.\n\n- MHD_pool_get_free\n  - Callee of try_grow_read_buffer. Included to inspect whether memory-pool helpers invoke higher-level connection logic (unlikely but must be ruled out) that could lead back to check_and_grow_read_buffer_space.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate\n  - Callee of try_grow_read_buffer. Same reason as MHD_pool_get_free: examine transitive calls for any path back to the target function.\n\n- has_unprocessed_upload_body_data_in_buffer\n  - Direct callee of check_and_grow_read_buffer_space. Although it currently shows no callees, we must inspect its implementation to ensure it does not call (directly or indirectly) MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info or other functions that call back to the target.\n\n- handle_recv_no_space\n  - Direct callee of check_and_grow_read_buffer_space. It has multiple callees; any of them could invoke code that eventually calls MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info or check_and_grow_read_buffer_space, creating indirect recursion.\n\n- connection_close_error\n  - Callee of handle_recv_no_space. Included to check whether it triggers higher-level connection management routines that could re-enter the target function.\n\n- transmit_error_response_len\n  - Callee of handle_recv_no_space. May interact with request/response handling logic that could call connection update paths; include to rule out cycles.\n\n- handle_req_headers_no_space\n  - Callee of handle_recv_no_space. Request-handling helpers commonly update connection state or event-loop info; must ensure they do not call back into MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info or check_and_grow_read_buffer_space.\n\n- handle_req_chunk_size_line_no_space\n  - Callee of handle_recv_no_space. Chunk-handling code may call connection-update or scheduling functions; include to check for back-edges.\n\n- handle_req_footers_no_space\n  - Callee of handle_recv_no_space. Footer-handling can likewise touch higher-level code paths; include to rule out recursion.\n\n- MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info\n  - Listed as a caller of check_and_grow_read_buffer_space in the static graph. To detect indirect recursion we must inspect this function and its transitive callees to ensure there is no path from any callee of check_and_grow_read_buffer_space back to it (which would close a cycle).\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_idle\n  - Caller of MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info (per graph). Included because call chains originating here could be part of a cycle that eventually calls check_and_grow_read_buffer_space; its implementation must be checked for any transitive calls that reach functions called by check_and_grow_read_buffer_space.\n\nSummary: to prove absence (or presence) of direct/indirect recursion we need the implementations (and transitive callees) of all direct callees of check_and_grow_read_buffer_space and the implementations of its callers (notably MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info and its callers). The listed symbols form the immediate transitive frontier required to detect any cycle involving the target function."
