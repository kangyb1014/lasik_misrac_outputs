  "explanation": "I have reported the fragments that look like unreachable-or-assumed-impossible code paths which need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1. In particular, the early return that exits when connection->state == MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED makes the later explicit switch case for MHD_CONNECTION_CLOSED redundant/unreachable; several switch cases are annotated with \"Should not be possible\" (mhd_assert(0)) and should be checked to confirm they cannot be reached at runtime. Other parts of the function are not reported because they represent normal, reachable control flow or are conditional on external compile-time options: - The bytes_read < 0 branch (error handling), the MHD_ERR_CONNRESET_ handling, and the subsequent CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR / MHD_connection_close_ calls are legitimate error paths and are reachable. - The bytes_read == 0 branch (remote closed connection) is a normal, reachable path. - The read-buffer-full check and the subsequent recv_cls call are part of the normal receive logic and are reachable. - The HTTPS/TLS handshake block is conditional on compile-time support and is reachable when that feature is enabled. - The START_REPLY branch that shrinks/realocates the buffer is reachable when state == MHD_CONNECTION_START_REPLY. - Calls to MHD_update_last_activity_, MHD_pool_reallocate, MHD_connection_close_, and related helpers are normal runtime behaviors and do not represent obviously unreachable code. These were not included to avoid false positives; please investigate the listed fragments to confirm whether they are truly unreachable (and thus violate MISRA 2.1) or whether the code/conditions need refactoring or clearer documentation."
