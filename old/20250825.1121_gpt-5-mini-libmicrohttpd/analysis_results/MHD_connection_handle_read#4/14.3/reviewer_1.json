In that expansion the controlling expression is a constant (invariant) and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not definitively correct. MISRA Rule 14.3 forbids invariant controlling expressions (e.g. if (0) or if (1)), but the rule is applied to the translation unit after macro expansion. Whether there is a violation therefore depends entirely on how mhd_assert is defined in the preprocessing environment used for this translation unit:\n\n- If mhd_assert expands to code that contains a conditional whose controlling expression is a constant (for example: if (!(0)) \u2026 or if (0) \u2026), then the preprocessed translation unit will contain an invariant controlling expression and Rule 14.3 would be violated (the agent A scenario is then correct).\n\n- If mhd_assert is defined as a no-op (e.g. ((void)0)) or otherwise expands to code that does not introduce an invariant controlling expression, there is no violation in the shown source.\n\nAgent A assumed a particular macro expansion (one that yields an invariant if/while). That is a plausible cause of a violation, but you cannot conclude the code violates MISRA 14.3 from the function source alone without knowing the actual definition of mhd_assert in the build. Therefore the report as stated is not categorically correct.\n\nRecommendation: ensure mhd_assert is implemented so it does not expand to selection/iteration statements with constant controlling expressions in translation units that must be MISRA-compliant (e.g. define it as ((void)0) in production or otherwise use constructs that avoid invariant if/while conditions)."
