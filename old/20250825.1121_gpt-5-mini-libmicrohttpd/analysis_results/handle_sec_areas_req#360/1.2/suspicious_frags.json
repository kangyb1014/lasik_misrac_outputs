  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. In particular, the code contains no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as __attribute__ or other __... identifiers, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, inline assembler (asm), nested functions, zero-length arrays, anonymous or compiler-specific anonymous unions/structs, GCC statement labels/labels-as-values, or other platform-specific pragmas. Casts between enum types, bitwise combinations of enum constants, sizeof on member arrays, switch/case fall-through, and the #if 0 conditional block are standard C and not compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions must not be used)."
