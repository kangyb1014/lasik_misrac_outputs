  "explanation": "No unreachable code detected. Rationale: \n- The initial guard (if ((NULL == crc) || (0 == block_size)) return NULL;) is a runtime check that may or may not return depending on inputs \u2014 it is reachable.\n- The allocation check (if (NULL == (response = MHD_calloc_(...))) return NULL;) is a runtime failure path and is reachable when allocation fails.\n- The assignments to response->fd, response->data, response->data_buffer_size and the subsequent field initializations are executed only after a successful allocation and are therefore reachable.\n- The conditional compilation block (#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)) is not dead code: when those macros are defined the mutex-initialization branch is present and its failure path (free(response); return NULL;) is reachable at runtime; when the macros are not defined the code is simply not part of the translation unit rather than being unreachable.\n- There are no statements after an unconditional return, no constant boolean expressions that render branches impossible, and no labeled blocks or fall-throughs that would be statically unreachable.\n- Pointer arithmetic (&response[1]) is used to locate the buffer following the struct in the allocated region; this is valid given the allocation and does not introduce unreachable code.\n\nTherefore no fragments in this function constitute statically unreachable code that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
