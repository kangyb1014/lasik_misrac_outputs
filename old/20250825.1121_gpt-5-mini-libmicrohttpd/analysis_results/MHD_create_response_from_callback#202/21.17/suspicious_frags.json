  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of <string.h> routines that may access beyond object bounds. In the provided code there are no direct calls to any <string.h> functions. The fragments selected cover all program points where a buffer and its size are established or handed to external code (allocation of the response plus block_size, obtaining the buffer pointer just after the struct, storing data_buffer_size, and assigning the content-reader callback and its closure). Also included are the callback typedef (which shows a char *buf and a size_t max) and the calloc macro, since these are the interfaces that determine buffer ownership/size and how data may later be written/read. Other lines in the function (mutex init, simple integer assignments, setting fd/reference_count/total_size, and returns) do not perform string/memory copying or expose buffer/size information and thus do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
