  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: fields such as first_header/last_header are list pointers whose semantics require mutable access; the data buffer size and numeric fields are non-pointer or already const-qualified where appropriate; the callback buffer parameter (char *buf) must be non-const because the callback writes into it; assignments like response->crc = crc and response->crfc = crfc merely copy function pointers consistent with the typedefs and do not themselves indicate missing const-qualification; thread/mutex handling and integer/enum fields are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. Therefore only the reported fragments warrant further investigation for whether pointer types should be const-qualified."
