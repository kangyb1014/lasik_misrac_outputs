  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ are provably unreachable you must know the control\u2011flow and non\u2011returning behavior of the functions/macros it calls and the relevant types. Specifically:\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_: The function's return behavior (can it ever return true/false, can it longjmp or abort) directly determines whether the \"return true;\" path is reachable and whether the subsequent free() calls and final return false are reachable. If this symbol is defined as non\u2011returning or always returning a constant, that can create unreachable code in the caller.\n\n- mhd_assert: The macro/function may abort or otherwise not return when its condition fails. Its definition (no\u2011op in release, aborting on failure, marked noreturn, etc.) affects whether code following the assertion can be considered reachable under all builds/configurations.\n\n- malloc: While normally returning, some projects may wrap or annotate malloc (noreturn on OOM, or can call exit/abort indirectly). The exact implementation/annotations are needed to know if control always continues after allocation or not.\n\n- free: If free is replaced/wrapped with a non\u2011returning implementation in this project, that would affect reachability of following code; include to confirm it is normal returning function.\n\n- memcpy: Typically does not affect control flow, but wrappers or project\u2011specific implementations could have side effects (e.g., trap/abort on overlap) or attributes; include to confirm it does not introduce non\u2011returning behaviour.\n\n- struct MHD_Response and enum MHD_ValueKind: Their definitions can reveal whether MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ is a macro or inline function depending on type layout/overloads, and are needed to resolve which overload/definition of MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ is actually called. They also help a static analyser resolve inlining and inter\u2011procedural reachability.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next agent resolve whether any return/abort/longjmp/noreturn behaviors make code paths in the target function unreachable under the project's actual definitions and build configurations."
