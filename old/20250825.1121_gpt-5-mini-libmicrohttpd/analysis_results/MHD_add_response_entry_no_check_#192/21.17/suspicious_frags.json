  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (string.h accesses beyond object bounds):\n- The malloc calls allocate header_len + 1 and content_len + 1, which provides space for the copied bytes plus the terminating zero written at header_malloced[header_len] and value_malloced[content_len].\n- The code checks the result of malloc for header_malloced (and for value_malloced before using it), so copies are not attempted into a NULL destination buffer.\n- The writes that place the terminating NUL characters are within the allocated buffers (index header_len and content_len are valid given the +1 allocation).\n- The mhd_assert checks ensure header_len and content_len are non-zero (note: assertions may be disabled in some builds, but these assertions are not string.h calls themselves).\n- Calls to MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ and the free operations are not uses of <string.h> functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.\n\nThe two memcpy calls shown above are the only uses of functions from <string.h> in the provided function and therefore should be investigated to ensure the source objects (header and content) are valid and have at least header_len and content_len accessible bytes respectively."
