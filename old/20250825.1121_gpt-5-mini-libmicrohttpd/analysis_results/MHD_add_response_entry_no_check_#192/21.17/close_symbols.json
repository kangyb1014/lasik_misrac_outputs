  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for verifying the MISRA C rule about string.h functions causing out-of-bounds accesses:\n\n- memcpy (from <string.h>): The two memcpy calls are the exact string.h usages under scrutiny. You must know its precise contract (it copies exactly n bytes and requires both source and destination to refer to objects with at least n bytes) to decide whether the calls can access beyond the bounds of their pointer arguments.\n\n- malloc (from <stdlib.h>): The code allocates header_len+1 and content_len+1 bytes and then uses memcpy to write header_len and content_len bytes into those allocations. To reason that the destination buffers are large enough (and that no integer overflow occurs in the size expression), you need malloc semantics (returns at least the requested bytes on success; returns NULL on failure) and to consider implementation limits.\n\n- size_t and unsigned integer addition semantics (overflow/wrap behaviour): The code computes header_len + 1 and content_len + 1. If header_len or content_len are very large, the addition may wrap (unsigned overflow), producing a smaller size passed to malloc and leading to a buffer too small for the subsequent memcpy. You must know unsigned arithmetic semantics and size_t width/limits to check for this possibility.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function): The function calls mhd_assert(0 != header_len) and similar for content_len. To know whether those assertions are active in the build (and hence whether 0-length cases are prevented at runtime) you need the definition/behaviour of mhd_assert (e.g., whether it is a no-op in release builds). This affects whether header_len or content_len can be zero and thus the special-case behavior of memcpy with n==0 and the allocation sizes.\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (callee used after allocation): Although memcpy executes before this call, understanding what the callee expects (ownership, required invariants on header/header_len/content/content_len) can be relevant to overall program correctness and whether the lengths supplied here are consistent with upstream invariants. Also its prototype confirms how the function uses the passed lengths and pointers.\n\n- All callers of MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ that supply header, header_len, content, content_len (their code / invariants / how those values are computed): The safety of memcpy depends on the provenance of the source pointers and the numeric values header_len and content_len. To prove the source objects have at least header_len/content_len bytes you must inspect every caller that constructs or passes these pointers and lengths (or otherwise establish a contract/invariant). Without caller information you cannot determine whether the memcpy sources are large enough.\n\n- Provenance and declared object sizes/bounds for the objects pointed-to by header and content (definitions of the buffers these pointers reference): Closely related to callers, you need the actual buffer declarations or documented invariants (e.g., they come from a caller that allocated or computed their size) to statically ensure the source buffers are at least header_len/content_len bytes long.\n\n- Prototype/declaration of MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ and any relevant typedefs: struct MHD_Response, enum MHD_ValueKind: These confirm parameter types and sizes so you can trace callers and check that types (e.g., size_t) and pointer qualifiers match the expectations used in the memcpy reasoning.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the two memcpy calls violate the MISRA rule you must (1) understand the memcpy contract, (2) ensure the destination allocations are of the requested size (including checking for size_t overflow), and (3) prove that the source pointers reference objects at least header_len/content_len bytes long. The symbols above are the minimal pieces of code/specification needed to perform those checks."
