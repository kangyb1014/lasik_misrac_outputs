  "explanation": "1) MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (prototype/definition): This is the callee that receives header_malloced and value_malloced and the response pointer. To decide whether the pointers passed should be const-qualified here you must know the parameter types and whether that function mutates (writes through) the header/value or the response. If the callee's parameters are const-qualified (or it never modifies those buffers) then header/value could be declared/treated as const; if it writes to them or accepts non-const, the current non-const allocation is required.  \n\n2) struct MHD_Response (complete type): The parameter response is a pointer to this type. To determine whether response could be a pointer-to-const (i.e. should be declared const struct MHD_Response *) you must know whether any operations (in this function or in MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_) modify the pointed-to structure; that depends on the structure's members and how they are used by callees.  \n\n3) malloc (prototype): The allocation returns void* and you need its prototype to verify conversions/assignments to char* or const char* and whether changing a variable to point-to-const would be legal/idiomatic.  \n\n4) free (prototype): To confirm correct ownership and lifetimes (and whether buffers can be declared const after allocation) you need free's prototype to reason about deallocation patterns.  \n\n5) memcpy (prototype): memcpy's signature (void *dest, const void *src, size_t) documents that the source may be const and destination must be writable; this is required to justify copying from original const inputs into newly-allocated writable buffers and to assess whether the newly-created buffers could instead be treated as pointers-to-const after initialization.\n\n(You can omit standard-library prototypes if the analyzer assumes standard C library signatures; the two project symbols absolutely required are MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ and the definition of struct MHD_Response.)"
