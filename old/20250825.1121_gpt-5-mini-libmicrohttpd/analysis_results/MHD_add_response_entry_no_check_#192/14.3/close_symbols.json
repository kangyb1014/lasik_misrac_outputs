Here are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions/semantics of the listed symbols because the MISRA rule applies to controlling expressions (the if tests in this function). Concretely:\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_: The value returned by this function (or macro) is used directly as a controlling expression in if (MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_(...)). If this symbol is a macro or a function that is known at compile time to always return the same boolean (or is a compile-time constant), that controlling expression would be invariant. To decide whether the if violates the rule we need the exact definition/behaviour of this symbol.\n\n- malloc (or any project-specific malloc wrapper): The tests if (NULL == header_malloced) and if (NULL != value_malloced) depend entirely on the behavior of malloc (or any replacement wrapper used in the project). If the project replaces malloc with an allocator that never returns NULL (e.g. an xmalloc that aborts on failure), those tests become invariant (always false or always true) and may violate the MISRA requirement. You must therefore know whether the standard malloc is used or a wrapper that makes the result non-NULL or otherwise constant.\n\n- mhd_assert (and the build configuration that controls it, e.g. NDEBUG): Although mhd_assert is not itself a controlling expression in the sense of if/while, its definition and whether it is active can impose or remove preconditions (0 != header_len, 0 != content_len). Those preconditions can affect whether some calls or branches are reachable in valid builds (and thus whether other controlling expressions are effectively invariant under normal usage). Also some assert implementations expand to conditional constructs that change control flow; therefore you must know its definition and whether it is compiled out (NDEBUG) to judge invariance correctly.\n\nNo other symbols from the function body (memcpy, free, NULL, parameter types) affect whether the three if-controlling expressions can be compile-time or project-wide invariants, so they are not required for this specific MISRA-rule analysis."
