  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect any symbols whose definitions/macros could hide such extensions. For each symbol listed below you should obtain its declaration/definition (and the headers that provide it) and check for use of non\u2011standard constructs (e.g. GCC/Clang __attribute__, __extension__ / __typeof__, statement\u2011expressions ({:}) , inline asm, nested functions, non\u2011standard keywords, compiler builtins, non\u2011standard variadic macros, etc.). Brief justification for each symbol:\n\n- mhd_assert: often a macro; its expansion might use compiler extensions (builtins, statement expressions, attributes, pragmas). You must examine it to ensure it is standard C.\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_: the called function's declaration/definition could use non\u2011standard attributes, calling conventions, or inline/extension constructs that affect whether the call uses language extensions.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: the type definition might use non\u2011standard bitfield widths, unnamed bitfields, or compiler extensions in its declaration (packed attributes, pragmas, etc.).\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: the enum definition could use compiler specific extensions or underlying type specifiers that are non\u2011standard.\n\n- malloc, free, memcpy: standard library functions typically are standard, but their declarations or replacement macros in the project headers could hide compiler extensions or non\u2011standard builtins; verify the actual declarations in use.\n\n- size_t: typedef for an integer type; its definition depends on headers/implementation and could use implementation\u2011specific typedefs \u2014 check the header to ensure no extension was used in its definition.\n\n- bool, true, false: if provided by <stdbool.h> or project headers, their definitions/macros should be checked to ensure they are standard and not implemented via compiler extensions.\n\n- NULL: a macro that can be defined in non\u2011portable ways (e.g. ((void*)0) vs 0L); check its definition for any extension use.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/declarations (and the headers that provide them) of each listed symbol to ensure none of them expand to or rely on documented compiler language extensions. Only after verifying these close symbols can you conclude whether the target function violates the MISRA rule about language extensions."
