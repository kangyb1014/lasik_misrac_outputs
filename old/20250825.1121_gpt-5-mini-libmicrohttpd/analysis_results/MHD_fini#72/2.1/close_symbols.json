  "explanation": "To decide whether any lines in MHD_fini are unreachable in the final translation unit you must know what the preprocessor produces and what the called identifiers actually are: \n\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT (preprocessor macro): The #ifdef controls whether the gnutls_global_deinit call is present at all. Reachability is determined on the preprocessed output, so you must know whether this macro is defined in the build.\n\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS (preprocessor macro): The #if defined(...) controls whether WSACleanup() is compiled in. Whether that branch exists in the final TU depends on this macro.\n\n- gnutls_global_deinit (declaration/definition or macro expansion): Some projects may #define this name to nothing or to a construct that changes control flow. You need its actual declaration/definition or macro expansion in the TU to tell whether the source line is executable code or removed/turned into non-executable text.\n\n- WSACleanup (declaration/definition or macro expansion): Same reason as above \u2014 it might be a macro or mapped to something platform-specific that affects whether the statement is executable.\n\n- build-time/compile-time configuration (compiler -D flags, config.h, platform-specific defines): The effective values of the macros come from project configuration and headers. You need the concrete build configuration and included config headers to determine which conditional branches are present in the compiled TU and therefore whether any code is unreachable.\n\n(You already have MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish in the call graph; the items above are the additional symbols/configuration needed to determine reachability per MISRA.)"
