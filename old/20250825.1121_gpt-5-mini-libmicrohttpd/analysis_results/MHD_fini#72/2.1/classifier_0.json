  "scenario": "The call to gnutls_global_deinit() is conditionally compiled under #ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT. This is not intrinsically unreachable: if HTTPS_SUPPORT can be defined in some build configuration the call is reachable. A rule violation would occur only if HTTPS_SUPPORT is guaranteed never to be defined in any project configuration (so the call can never be compiled into or executed in any build), in which case the code is effectively unreachable across the project."
