  "explanation": "The rest of the function consists solely of the unconditional call\n  MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish ();\nand the function signature/closing brace. There are no control-flow statements (returns, goto, infinite loops, or conditional branches) inside the visible code that would make any of those statements unreachable at runtime within a given translation unit. The only parts that could vary between builds are the two conditional compilation blocks listed above, so those are the only fragments that merit investigation for potential unreachable-code issues under different build configurations. No other fragments in this function need investigation."
