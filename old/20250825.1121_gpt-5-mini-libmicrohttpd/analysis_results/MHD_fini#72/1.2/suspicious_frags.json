  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code. The file contains a plain C function definition and standard preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef / #if defined / #endif), which are part of standard C and not compiler extensions. The calls to gnutls_global_deinit() and WSACleanup() are library/platform API calls (GNUTLS and WinSock) and not language extensions; they should be checked for correct usage, but they do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __inline (as a compiler extension), typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords or syntax that would be documented as extensions. Therefore no fragments require investigation under Rule 1.2."
