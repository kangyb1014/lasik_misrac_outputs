  "explanation": "- HTTPS_SUPPORT: a preprocessor macro that controls whether gnutls_global_deinit is compiled in. Need its definition to determine whether non\u2011standard preprocessor behavior or compiler-specific macros are used (and whether the call is actually compiled).\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: a preprocessor macro that controls inclusion of WSACleanup. Its definition/context determines platform-specific code paths and whether Windows API declarations (which often use compiler extensions) are introduced.\n- gnutls_global_deinit (prototype/header): the function\u2019s declaration (and the header that provides it) must be inspected for use of compiler extensions (for example, attributes like __attribute__ or visibility annotations) in its prototype.\n- WSACleanup (prototype/header): the Windows API declaration often uses calling\u2011convention or import/export annotations (e.g. WINAPI, __stdcall, __declspec(dllimport)). Inspecting its declaration/header is required to detect such language extensions.\n- MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish (prototype/header): although present in the call graph, its declaration/header must be checked for attributes or non\u2011standard annotations attached to the function prototype.\n- <gnutls/gnutls.h> (or the specific header that declares gnutls_global_deinit): headers can introduce compiler extensions via macros or attributes; examine the header to detect any extension usage.\n- <winsock2.h> / <windows.h> (or the header that declares WSACleanup): Windows headers commonly use macros that expand to compiler extensions; the header must be examined to determine whether such extensions are present.\n- WINAPI / __stdcall / __attribute__ / __declspec (compiler annotation tokens): these specific tokens are examples of language extensions or non\u2011standard annotations that may appear in the above prototypes/headers. The analysis must look for these (and similar) tokens to decide whether the code uses compiler\u2011documented language extensions.\n\nInclude these symbols in the next-agent prompt so it can fetch the relevant declarations/macros/headers and search them for any compiler\u2011documented language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
