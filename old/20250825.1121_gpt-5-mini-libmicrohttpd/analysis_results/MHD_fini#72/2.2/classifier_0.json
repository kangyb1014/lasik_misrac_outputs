  "scenario": "By default this fragment does not obviously violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The call gnutls_global_deinit() is a library cleanup call that normally has observable side effects (releasing library/global resources), so its presence cannot be assumed to be dead code without further information. However a violation scenario exists: if HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined so the call is compiled and executed, but the implementation of gnutls_global_deinit() is effectively a no\u2011op (empty or only contains operations with no observable side effects for the program), then the call would be an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 i.e. dead code. To decide for the project: inspect the actual definition/behavior of gnutls_global_deinit() (and build configurations for HTTPS_SUPPORT)."
