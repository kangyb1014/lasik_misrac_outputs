  "explanation": "Other fragments were not flagged because they are not clearly candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Specifically:\n- The unconditional call MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish (); in MHD_fini() is an explicit cleanup call; it is executed and may have observable side effects, so it cannot be assumed dead without further runtime/configuration information.\n- The function definition of MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish itself is active code; only the internal conditional block (guarded by HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME and the runtime check) can potentially be a no-op at runtime \u2014 that block is reported above.\n- There is no unreachable code present (no code after returns, no unreachable labels); unreachable code is explicitly excluded by the rule notes.\n- Initialization vs assignment: no static initializers are present here that would be misclassified as dead code.\n\nThe three reported fragments are the only places where either (a) code can be omitted at compile time via macros (HTTPS_SUPPORT, MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS, HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME) or (b) a runtime test may render code never executed (the mono_clock_service comparison). These merit investigation to determine whether their execution (or non-execution) is actually dead code in the project context."
