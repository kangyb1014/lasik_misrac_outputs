  "explanation": "- MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish: It is the direct callee shown in the call graph \u2014 you must inspect its body (and its transitive callees) to ensure it does not (directly or indirectly) call MHD_fini, which would create indirect recursion.\\n- gnutls_global_deinit: Conditionally called when HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined; although an external library function, its implementation (or any callbacks it triggers) must be checked to ensure it does not call back into MHD_fini or any function that eventually calls MHD_fini.\\n- WSACleanup: Conditionally called when MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS is defined; like the above, verify that it (or any side-effects/callbacks) does not lead back to MHD_fini.\\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT: Preprocessor macro that determines presence of gnutls_global_deinit call \u2014 needed to know whether that call exists in the compiled build being analyzed.\\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: Preprocessor macro that determines presence of WSACleanup call \u2014 needed to know whether that call exists in the compiled build being analyzed."
