  "explanation": "gnutls_global_deinit \u2014 The target function conditionally calls this routine when HTTPS_SUPPORT is defined. To determine whether MHD_fini can violate the <string.h> bounds rule you must inspect gnutls_global_deinit\u2019s implementation (and any functions it calls) for use of memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn/etc. Any out-of-bounds accesses would come from that body.\n\nWSACleanup \u2014 The target function conditionally calls this WinSock API when MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS is defined. Even though it is a system API, you must know whether the call is present (macro) and whether any wrapper or local implementation is used that might invoke string.h functions. Include WSACleanup (or the wrapper used in this build) and inspect its implementation or callers.\n\nMHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish \u2014 This is an unconditional callee in the static call graph. You must inspect its definition and any functions it calls to see if they use string.h routines incorrectly (buffers passed to memcpy/strcpy/etc.).\n\nHTTPS_SUPPORT and MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS (preprocessor macros) \u2014 These determine whether gnutls_global_deinit and WSACleanup are compiled into MHD_fini. The analysis must know the build configuration to decide which callees are relevant.\n\nTransitive callees of the above functions \u2014 If any of the above functions call other routines that use string.h functions, those downstream implementations must be examined as well. In practice, supply the full bodies (source) of each listed callee and their callees so the analyzer can find any use of the string.h APIs and check parameter sizes/bounds."
