  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code. MHD_fini only calls gnutls_global_deinit(), WSACleanup(), and MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish(), and the latter calls mach_port_deallocate() and assigns a service handle \u2014 none of these are string-handling operations or involve buffer/array copies in the shown code. There are no character arrays, pointer-based string operations, or calls to standard string functions to inspect here. Note: if the implementations of gnutls_global_deinit, WSACleanup, or other external/library functions (not provided) use string.h functions internally, those implementations would need to be reviewed separately; they are not present in the supplied code and therefore are not flagged."
