  "explanation": "- gnutls_global_deinit: Called (under HTTPS_SUPPORT). Must be inspected to see if it (or any functions it calls) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. If gnutls_global_deinit contains or calls code that uses memcmp on C-strings, that would make MHD_fini violate the MISRA rule when built with HTTPS_SUPPORT.\n- WSACleanup: Called (under MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS). Although unlikely, it (or functions it pulls in) could contain memcmp usage; include it to confirm no memcmp-on-strings occurs on that build path.\n- MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish: The direct callee shown in the static call graph. Its body and any callees must be checked for memcmp usage so that MHD_fini\u2019s overall call-tree can be validated.\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule. You must locate usages of this symbol in the bodies of the callees (and their callees) to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (the specific MISRA violation).\n- HTTPS_SUPPORT and MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: Preprocessor feature-test macros that control whether gnutls_global_deinit and WSACleanup are compiled into MHD_fini. Their definitions are required to know which call paths are actually present in a given build and therefore which symbols need to be analyzed for memcmp usage."
