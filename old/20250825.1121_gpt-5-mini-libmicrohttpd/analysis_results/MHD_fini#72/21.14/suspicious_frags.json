  "explanation": "I examined the provided target function MHD_fini and the related MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish definition. Neither code fragment contains any use of the standard library function memcmp, nor any explicit string comparisons that could be implemented via memcmp on null-terminated strings. The functions only call gnutls_global_deinit, WSACleanup, MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish, and mach_port_deallocate; none of these calls in the shown code invoke memcmp. No preprocessor branches in the shown code introduce memcmp either. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
