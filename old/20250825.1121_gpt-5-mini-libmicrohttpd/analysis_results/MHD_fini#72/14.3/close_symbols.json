  "explanation": "HTTPS_SUPPORT and MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: these preprocessor symbols control whether code is compiled into MHD_fini. To decide if the compiled function contains any (possibly invariant) controlling expressions you must know whether these macros are defined in the build (and how).\n\ngnutls_global_deinit and WSACleanup: these identifiers might be plain function calls, but they could also be macros or inline wrappers that expand into additional statements (including control statements) inside MHD_fini. You need their declarations/definitions to determine whether their expansion/introduction creates any controlling expressions in the caller.\n\nconfig.h / build-time macro definitions (compiler -D flags): the actual definition locations (project config headers or compiler command-line defines) are required to determine the presence/absence/value of the above preprocessor symbols for the translation unit being analysed; this decides which source lines are compiled and whether any invariant controlling expressions can appear in the compiled MHD_fini."
