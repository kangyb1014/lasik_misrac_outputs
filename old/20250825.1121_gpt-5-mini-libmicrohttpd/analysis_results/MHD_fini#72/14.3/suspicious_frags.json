  "explanation": "The provided function contains no runtime controlling expressions (no if, switch, for, while, or do-while statements) whose controlling expressions could be invariant. The only conditional constructs are preprocessor directives (#ifdef / #if defined), which are evaluated at compile time and are not subject to MISRA C Rule 14.3 (which applies to runtime controlling expressions). The body consists solely of function calls and preprocessor-gated calls; none introduce a controlling expression that could violate the rule. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 14.3."
