  "explanation": "gnutls_global_deinit \u2014 need its prototype/definition to verify whether it takes any pointer parameters (and if so whether they should be const). Even though MHD_fini calls it with no arguments, the function signature can reveal pointer usage or side-effects that affect MISRA pointer rules.\n\nWSACleanup \u2014 need its prototype/definition (or the winsock header declaration) to confirm it has no pointer parameters or, if it does in some build, whether those pointers are const-qualified. Also required to know whether the call is present in the compiled configuration.\n\nMHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish \u2014 need its prototype and definition to inspect any pointer parameters or internal pointer usage; this callee is the only non-library call unconditionally invoked and could contain pointer usage that relates to the MISRA rule.\n\nHTTPS_SUPPORT (preprocessor symbol) \u2014 need the macro/configuration to know whether gnutls_global_deinit is actually compiled into MHD_fini in the build being analyzed; conditional inclusion affects which symbols and signatures matter for the MISRA check.\n\nMHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS (preprocessor symbol) \u2014 need this macro to know whether WSACleanup is compiled into MHD_fini. Conditional compilation determines whether the winsock prototype/usage must be considered for the MISRA pointer rule."
