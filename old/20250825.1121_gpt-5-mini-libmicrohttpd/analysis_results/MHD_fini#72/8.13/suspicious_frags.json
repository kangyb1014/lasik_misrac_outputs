  "explanation": "I examined MHD_fini and the referenced MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish. There are no pointer declarations or pointer-typed function parameters/returns in these fragments: MHD_fini only calls gnutls_global_deinit, WSACleanup and MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish (no pointer arguments). In MHD_monotonic_sec_counter_finish the code compares mono_clock_service to _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV and passes mono_clock_service to mach_port_deallocate along with mach_task_self(); these are Mach port identifiers (integer/port types), not pointers. No other pointer variables or pointer usages appear in the provided code, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to const-qualified type where possible) is not applicable to any fragment shown."
