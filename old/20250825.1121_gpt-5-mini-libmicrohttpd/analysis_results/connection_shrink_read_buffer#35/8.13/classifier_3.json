  "scenario": "No violation. Assigning NULL to c->read_buffer is an assignment to the pointer itself, not to the pointed-to object. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns the declaration of pointer types (they should point to const-qualified types when the pointed-to data is not modified). In this code the buffer is reallocated and used for mutable data, so the pointer should remain non-const. It would be a violation only if read_buffer actually pointed to data that is never modified and therefore should have been declared as pointer-to-const."
