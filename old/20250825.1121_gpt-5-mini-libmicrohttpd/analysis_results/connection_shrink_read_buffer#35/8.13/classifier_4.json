  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No. Both new_buf and c->read_buffer are non-const (void *), and the buffer is intended to be mutable (read data is written into it). The assignment c->read_buffer = new_buf does not discard a const qualifier. A violation would occur if a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void *) were assigned to a non-const pointer (void *), which would discard const \u2014 but that is not the case here."
