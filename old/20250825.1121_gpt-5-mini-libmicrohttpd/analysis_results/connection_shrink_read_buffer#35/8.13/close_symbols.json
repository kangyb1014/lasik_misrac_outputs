  "explanation": "For determining whether read_buffer could/should be declared as a pointer-to-const (MISRA: use const whenever possible) we must know (1) the exact declared type of the field, (2) whether any API called here or elsewhere requires a non-const pointer, and (3) whether any other code writes through or assigns non-const memory to that field. Each listed symbol is required for those checks:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (definition): shows the declared type of read_buffer, read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset and pool. You must see the declared pointer type to judge whether it can be const-qualified and to find all field accesses.\n\n- MHD_pool_deallocate (prototype): its parameter type (void * vs const void *) matters: if the deallocator requires a non-const pointer then read_buffer cannot be const without casts.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate (prototype): reallocate\u2019s parameter and return types determine whether read_buffer must be a mutable pointer and whether const qualification would be incompatible.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (prototype): its parameter types similarly affect const-compatibility checks.\n\n- type/definition of connection->pool (the pool object type): needed to resolve the above pool function signatures (they may be methods or macros tied to the pool type) and confirm parameter expectations.\n\n- MHD_connection_handle_read (definition / uses of c->read_buffer): likely writes incoming data into read_buffer; any write-through makes const qualification invalid.\n\n- try_grow_read_buffer (definition / uses of c->read_buffer): functions named like this often reallocate or write to the buffer; their signatures and uses determine mutability requirements.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ (definition / uses of c->read_buffer): allocation routines that set/initialize read_buffer may require non-const pointer or write into the buffer.\n\n- connection_maximize_write_buffer (definition / uses of c->read_buffer): may perform writes or resizing that require mutable pointer semantics.\n\n- try_ready_chunked_body (definition / uses of c->read_buffer) and transmit_error_response_len (definition / uses of c->read_buffer): these appear in the pool reallocate/deallocate call graph; they may pass read_buffer to APIs that require non-const pointers or write through it.\n\nIn short: you need the struct field declarations and all prototypes/usages that either (a) accept read_buffer as an argument (to check const in parameter lists) or (b) dereference/write to the buffer (to prove it must remain mutable). Without those symbols you cannot conclude whether read_buffer can safely be const-qualified."
