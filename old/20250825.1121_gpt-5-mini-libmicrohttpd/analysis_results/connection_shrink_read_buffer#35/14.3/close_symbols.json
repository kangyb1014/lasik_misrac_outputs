  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C 'Controlling expressions shall not be invariant' we must know whether the boolean tests in connection_shrink_read_buffer can be compile-time or function-scope invariants. Reason each symbol is needed:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): The conditions reference c->read_buffer, c->read_buffer_size and c->read_buffer_offset. The struct definition gives the exact types, qualifiers (const/volatile), and any embedded invariants or bitfields that could make these expressions invariant.\n\n- types of read_buffer_size and read_buffer_offset: These types (e.g., size_t, unsigned, signed) affect whether comparisons against 0 are meaningful/constant and whether there are implicit promotions/undefined behaviour that could make expressions effectively invariant.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/definition): mhd_assert is used repeatedly. If it expands to code containing controlling expressions (e.g. do { if (!(expr)) abort(); } while(0)) or is compiled out, that changes whether any invariant appears in compiled control flow. We must know its expansion to ensure no hidden invariant controlling expression is introduced or removed.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (definition or macro): Used inside an mhd_assert. If this is a macro that expands to a constant (or has side effects), it could create an invariant controlling expression inside the assert expansion. Knowing its definition prevents false positives/negatives.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate (prototype and semantic guarantees): The code asserts new_buf == c->read_buffer after reallocate. To determine whether any controlling expression elsewhere becomes invariant because reallocation behavior is guaranteed (or not), we need the semantic contract (can it return a different pointer, can it change buffer contents, does it have side effects that influence subsequent tests).\n\n- MHD_pool_deallocate (prototype): While not used in any controlling expression here, its semantics can affect whether fields are changed only by this function or externally; also if it is a macro with control-flow, that could affect invariance reasoning at call sites.\n\n- connection_switch_from_recv_to_send (caller implementation / callsite): The caller may establish preconditions (for example always calling connection_shrink_read_buffer only when read_buffer_offset==0 or read_buffer==NULL). To determine whether a controlling expression inside connection_shrink_read_buffer is invariant at call time we must inspect the caller(s) that set up the connection state before this function is invoked.\n\nProviding these symbols allows a precise determination whether the if/else controlling expressions in connection_shrink_read_buffer are potentially constant/invariant, or depend on mutable state and thus comply with the MISRA rule."
