  "explanation": "For checking whether connection_shrink_read_buffer (directly or via its callees) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the following symbols are needed:\n\n- MHD_pool_deallocate: This is a direct callee. We must inspect its implementation to see if it (or code it invokes) calls memcmp on buffer contents or otherwise compares null-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: This is a direct callee. Its implementation could perform copy/compare operations (including memcmp) when resizing/reallocating buffers; we need to inspect it for any memcmp usage on string data.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: This is invoked prior to reallocation in the target function. Its implementation may examine buffer contents (and possibly call memcmp). Include it so we can determine whether it uses memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\n- mhd_assert: The macro/function used for internal checks is invoked in this function. Although unlikely, an assert macro could expand to code that performs comparisons; include its definition to rule out any memcmp usage introduced via assertions.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The type definition (fields: read_buffer, read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset, pool, etc.) is needed to understand the semantics of read_buffer (is it treated as a byte buffer or as a C string?). Knowing the intended content determines whether any memcmp found in callees would be comparing null-terminated strings (MISRA violation) or arbitrary bytes (allowed by the rule).\n\n- memcmp: Include the symbol so the analyzer can find all occurrences/usages across direct callees (and their callees, if needed). The presence/location of memcmp calls is the primary concern for the MISRA check.\n\nNote: The static call graph shows only the two pool functions as direct callees; therefore the immediate focus is on those implementations (plus is_resizable and the assert macro) and the MHD_Connection definition to determine buffer semantics. If memcmp is not present in these, the analyzer may optionally expand to other functions that allocate/use the same buffers (e.g., functions that write/read into read_buffer) but those are not required as first-level symbols."
