  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the function parameter itself; it allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter. In this function there is no assignment to the parameter variable 'connection' (no \"connection = ...\" or similar). The local alias is declared as 'struct MHD_Connection *const c = connection;' so the local pointer is const and cannot be changed; all assignments in the body (c->read_buffer = NULL, c->read_buffer_size = 0, c->read_buffer = new_buf, c->read_buffer_size = c->read_buffer_offset) modify members of the pointed-to object, which is permitted by the rule. Calls that pass those members to pool functions only pass objects by value and do not modify the parameter variable. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and no further investigation of other fragments is required for this rule."
