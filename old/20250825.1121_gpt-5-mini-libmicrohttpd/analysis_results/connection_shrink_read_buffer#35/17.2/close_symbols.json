  "explanation": "To determine whether connection_shrink_read_buffer can (directly or indirectly) call itself you must examine all functions it invokes and any functions they invoke. The following symbols are required:\n\n- MHD_pool_deallocate: direct callee (called when read_buffer_offset == 0). We must inspect its body/callees to ensure it does not call back into connection_shrink_read_buffer (or into other functions that eventually do).\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: direct callee (called when read_buffer_offset > 0). We must inspect its body/callees to ensure it does not call back into connection_shrink_read_buffer (or into other functions that eventually do).\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: called inside an assertion guard; it is a direct call in the function and must be checked in case it (or its callees) lead back to connection_shrink_read_buffer.\n- mhd_assert: the assertion wrapper/macro used around MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace and other checks \u2014 if this expands to or calls a function, its implementation and callees must be checked for possible callbacks.\n\nIf the bodies/call graphs of these symbols contain no path back to connection_shrink_read_buffer (transitively), then the MISRA rule against direct/indirect self-calls is not violated. The provided static call graph already shows MHD_pool_deallocate and MHD_pool_reallocate have no callees; however you still need the full definitions/call-graphs of the listed symbols to be certain."
