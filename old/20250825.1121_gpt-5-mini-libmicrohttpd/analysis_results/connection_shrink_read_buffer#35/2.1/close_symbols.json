  "explanation": "For deciding whether any part of connection_shrink_read_buffer is unreachable we must know the types, contracts and side effects of the symbols it uses and the functions that establish invariants on the connection fields. Brief reasons for each symbol:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: Required to know the exact fields (read_buffer, read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset, pool), their types and any documented invariants or initial/default values that could make branches always true/false.\n\n- mhd_assert: Needed to know the assert implementation/behavior (abort, side-effects, or compiled-out no-op). If assertions abort or perform non-local exits the control-flow/reachability of subsequent statements changes; if compiled out, they do not affect reachability.\n\n- MHD_pool_deallocate: Its semantics (does it longjmp/abort, can it be a no-op, does it modify other global state) affect whether the deallocate branch can be considered reachable / whether control returns after the call.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: Must know whether it can return NULL or a different pointer, whether it can fail/abort, and whether it can move memory (i.e. return a different address). These affect whether the assert comparing c->read_buffer == new_buf can ever fail and whether the else-branch is meaningful/reachable.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: Even though used only in an assert, its semantics may determine whether the reallocation-branch is ever taken or can be assumed always true/false by callers; also whether the assert can be relied on for reachability reasoning.\n\n- MHD_Pool (type and semantics): The pool object type and allocator policy (resizable-in-place guarantee, failure modes) are needed to reason about allocator calls above and whether allocation-related branches can occur.\n\n- connection_switch_from_recv_to_send: This function is a direct caller of connection_shrink_read_buffer. Its calling context and the state it passes can constrain the values of read_buffer/size/offset and render some branches unreachable; we need its contract to assess reachability.\n\n- MHD_connection_alloc_memory_, try_grow_read_buffer, connection_maximize_write_buffer, MHD_connection_handle_read, try_ready_chunked_body: These functions (listed because they call or interact with MHD_pool_reallocate or modify the connection's buffer fields) may establish invariants about read_buffer, read_buffer_size and read_buffer_offset (for example, always allocating non-NULL buffer when size>0, maintaining offset==0 in some states, or guaranteeing in-place reallocation). Their semantics and where/how they set these fields are necessary to decide if any branch in connection_shrink_read_buffer can never be reached.\n\nIn short: you need the struct definition and the runtime/contract semantics of the assert macro and the pool allocator API, plus the callers/allocators that establish or mutate the fields used in conditional tests, to determine if any code in connection_shrink_read_buffer is provably unreachable (MISRA rule)."
