  "explanation": "For analyzing whether this function can violate the MISRA rule about string.h functions you must know the memory layout, sizes, and allocator behaviour used here (even though the function itself doesn't call memcpy/etc., the pool routines it calls may). Reasons for each symbol:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function reads and writes the fields read_buffer, read_buffer_size, read_buffer_offset and pool. You need the exact field types and semantic invariants (what read_buffer_offset means: number of valid bytes, whether buffers are byte arrays) to reason about any potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses when buffer sizes are changed.\n\n- MHD_pool_reallocate: This is the key function that resizes the buffer. You need its prototype and semantics (parameters order and meaning, return value on success/failure, whether it may move the block, whether it copies data and how many bytes it copies, whether it may call memcpy/memmove internally and with what lengths). That determines whether any internal string.h calls could access beyond the source/destination ranges when shrinking to read_buffer_offset.\n\n- MHD_pool_deallocate: You need its prototype/semantics to ensure deallocation is correctly paired with the pointer and size (no lingering uses), and to know whether it touches memory in ways that could call string.h functions with invalid ranges.\n\n- MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace: The function calls this to assert in\u2011place resizability before reallocate. You must know what this predicate guarantees (if true, does reallocate guarantee to keep the same pointer and not move/copy data?) because that affects whether any internal mem* calls would copy overlapping/overrun regions.\n\n- mhd_assert: Understand whether assertions are active in the build under analysis (they may be no\u2011ops in release). If assertions are stripped out, code paths/assumptions (for example the assert that new_buf == c->read_buffer) cannot be relied on to prevent unsafe behaviour \u2014 this affects whether internal mem* calls might operate on unexpected sizes/pointers.\n\n- type of read_buffer_size/read_buffer_offset (e.g. size_t): Exact integer types are required to reason about ranges, wraparound, and comparisons (e.g. if signed/unsigned mismatch could mask an out\u2011of\u2011bounds size passed to pool routines that may then call memcpy/etc.).\n\n- type of pool (e.g. MHD_Pool): The allocator object type may determine semantics of its functions (thread safety, allocation strategy) and is needed to find the implementations of the pool functions above.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst inspect the implementations and contracts of the pool routines and the connection fields to determine whether any string.h calls (directly in this function or indirectly inside pool functions) can be invoked with pointer/length arguments that would access memory out of bounds."
