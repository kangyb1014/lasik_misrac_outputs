Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "tool_params (specifically tool_params.all_cpus) \u2014 required to determine whether the if-condition can ever be true or false (is the conditional body ever executed or is it effectively no-op). num_threads \u2014 the global/extern variable written here; you must see its declaration and all other reads/writes to decide whether assigning it is observable (i.e. whether removing the assignment would change program behaviour). get_process_cpu_core_count \u2014 to understand the returned value and any side-effects (does it update globals, cache state, or perform observable actions) so you can tell if the call is removable. detect_process_cpu_core_count \u2014 implementation detail of the above; needed if it has side-effects that make the call non-dead. get_cpu_core_count \u2014 value compared to num_threads; need its semantics/side-effects (stable value, expensive, or has observable effects) to assess removability of the comparison and subsequent call. detect_cpu_core_count \u2014 implementation detail of get_cpu_core_count; include if it performs side-effects. print_all_cores_used \u2014 called when the equality holds; must know whether this function has observable side-effects (I/O, logging, state changes) so its call is not dead. printf \u2014 the function is invoked unconditionally when tool_params.all_cpus is true; printf is an observable I/O side-effect and must be considered when deciding if the function's body is dead. get_num_threads \u2014 a likely reader/consumer of num_threads elsewhere; include to determine whether the assigned num_threads value produced here is later used. check_apply_params \u2014 caller/context where tool_params may be set and this function invoked; needed to trace call ordering and initialization so you can tell whether this function is ever executed and whether its effects are observable. main \u2014 program entrypoint/context: to establish the runtime ordering and whether this code path is reachable/executed during normal operation. check_apply_param__threads \u2014 a related caller that also interacts with the same helpers/variables; include to compare usage patterns and side-effects (helps determine if shared operations here are redundant or necessary)."
