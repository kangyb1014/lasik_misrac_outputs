  "explanation": "I flagged the assignments and related prints in check_apply_param__all_cpus and check_apply_param__threads because they interact (both set num_threads) and some of those operations can be redundant depending on the combination/order of parameters: an earlier assignment to num_threads may be overwritten before any use, and the second fetch of get_process_cpu_core_count() in the warning fprintf is potentially redundant. These are the operations most likely to be executed while having no effect on program behaviour and therefore should be investigated for possible dead code.\n\nOther fragments from the provided code are not reported because they either a) produce externally observable side-effects (printf/fprintf messages that change program behaviour if removed), b) return values that are used later in program logic, c) implement caching and lazy initialization that affect behaviour (the static caches in get_cpu_core_count / get_process_cpu_core_count), or d) are inside #if 0 blocks (disabled and not compiled). Those do not look like executed operations whose removal would be behaviourally neutral and so are not considered suspicious for Rule 2.2 based on the supplied code."
