  "explanation": "- get_process_cpu_core_count: Called directly by the target function; its implementation may invoke string.h functions (directly or via callees) that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. You must inspect it.  \n- detect_process_cpu_core_count: Callee of get_process_cpu_core_count; include it because string.h uses might occur there.  \n- get_cpu_core_count: Called directly by the target function; its implementation may use string.h functions and must be inspected.  \n- detect_cpu_core_count: Callee of get_cpu_core_count; include it to cover any string.h use reachable through get_cpu_core_count.  \n- print_all_cores_used: Called directly by the target function; its implementation could use string.h functions (formatting/concatenation, buffers) that might violate the rule.  \n- tool_params: Global object examined by the function (tool_params.all_cpus). Its type and members (sizes, any embedded strings/pointers) must be known to rule out indirect string operations or aliasing that could lead to string.h calls.  \n- num_threads: Global (or file-scope) variable assigned here and potentially used elsewhere; include to understand storage, type, and any interactions in other functions (e.g., functions that use num_threads with string buffers) that could involve string.h calls.\n\nThese symbols cover the direct call chain and relevant globals reachable from the target function; inspecting them will reveal any uses of <string.h> functions that could cause out-of-bounds accesses in code executed as part of the target's behavior."
