  "explanation": "No function in the provided code has parameters that could be modified. All shown functions use a void parameter list (check_apply_param__all_cpus, get_process_cpu_core_count, get_cpu_core_count, print_all_cores_used) and therefore cannot violate Rule 17.8. The only assignments (e.g. to num_threads, to static locals proc_num_cpu_cores and num_cpu_cores, or to fields of the global tool_params structure) modify global or local objects, not function parameters. Since Rule 17.8 concerns modification of function parameters (or pointer parameters themselves), there are no suspicious fragments to investigate in the supplied code."
