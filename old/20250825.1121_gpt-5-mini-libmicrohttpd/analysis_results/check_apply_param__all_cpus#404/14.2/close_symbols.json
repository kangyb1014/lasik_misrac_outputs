The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "tool_params / tool_params.all_cpus: to determine the type and evaluation semantics of the all_cpus flag (is it a Boolean type, does reading it have side-effects or is it a macro/function) \u2014 MISRA requires knowing whether a control flag is a Boolean and whether reading it produces side effects.\n\nnum_threads: to see its declaration/type and whether it is used elsewhere as a loop counter or modified in called functions; the rule limits loop-counter usage and forbids modification in loop body/called functions.\n\nget_process_cpu_core_count: the function is called by the target; its body must be inspected for any for-loops (their clauses and counters) because the behaviour of functions called within a statement is part of the loop body for MISRA analysis.\n\ndetect_process_cpu_core_count: callee of get_process_cpu_core_count; include to inspect for-loops or side-effects that could affect loop-counter usage or modify objects used as loop counters.\n\nget_cpu_core_count: called by the target; include to inspect its implementation for for-loops or side-effects that could violate the for-loop well-formedness rule when invoked from this function.\n\ndetect_cpu_core_count: callee of get_cpu_core_count; include for the same reason as other callees \u2014 to find any loops or modifications of shared objects.\n\nprint_all_cores_used: called by the target; include to inspect whether it contains for-loops or modifies objects that could interact with loop counters (MISRA counts called functions as part of loop body behavior).\n\nprintf: standard I/O function used here; include its declaration to confirm it has no relevant side-effects on loop counters or control flags (reading/writing global objects) that would affect the MISRA for-loop analysis.\n\nBoolean type definition (e.g. bool/_Bool/typedef): MISRA refers to a Boolean type and loop control flags; include the project boolean typedef/_Bool/bool definitions to decide whether all_cpus or other flags qualify as Boolean control flags."
