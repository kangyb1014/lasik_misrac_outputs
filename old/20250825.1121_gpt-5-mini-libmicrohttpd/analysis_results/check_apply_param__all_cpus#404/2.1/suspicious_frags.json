  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No code fragments appear to be statically unreachable. Rationale:\n\n- check_apply_param__all_cpus: the early return depends on the runtime value tool_params.all_cpus; the remaining statements are reachable when that flag is true. There is no code after a guaranteed return nor any mutually exclusive constant conditions that make branches impossible.\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count and get_cpu_core_count: the static-cache pattern (static variable initialized to 0 and set on first call) is a runtime lazy-initialization idiom; its conditional (0 == var) is true on the first call and false on subsequent calls, so both outcomes are reachable at runtime across the program lifetime.\n\n- detect_process_cpu_core_count and detect_cpu_core_count: their branches depend on runtime results from mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count() and mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count(), including fallbacks and clamps; none of the branches are unconditional or provably impossible. The #ifdef MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT block is a preprocessor conditional \u2014 code excluded by the preprocessor is not part of the compilation unit and therefore is not \u201cunreachable code\u201d in the compiled program.\n\n- print_all_cores_used and the printf calls: all are reachable depending on runtime values returned by the detection functions.\n\nGiven these points, there are no instances of code that are provably unreachable at compile time in the supplied snippets, so no fragments require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
