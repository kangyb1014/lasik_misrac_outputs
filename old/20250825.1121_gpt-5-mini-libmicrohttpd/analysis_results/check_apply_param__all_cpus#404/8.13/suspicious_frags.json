  "explanation": "No pointer declarations, pointer parameters, or pointer expressions are present in the provided code fragment. The function check_apply_param__all_cpus has no parameters and contains only scalar/enum/field accesses and calls to other functions; there are no pointer types to assess for const qualification. The additional symbol (enum MHD_AuthType type) is an enum, not a pointer. Any pointer usage that might exist inside the called functions (get_process_cpu_core_count, get_cpu_core_count, print_all_cores_used) or in other parts of the program is not present in the supplied code, so it cannot be evaluated here for Rule 8.13. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippet that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
