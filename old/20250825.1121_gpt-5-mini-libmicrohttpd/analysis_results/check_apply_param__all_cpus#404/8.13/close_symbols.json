  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function violates the MISRA rule that pointers should be const-qualified whenever possible we must know the types and signatures of every symbol used in the function so we can see whether any pointer types are present and whether they should be const.\n\n- tool_params (and its struct/type definition): The function reads tool_params.all_cpus. We must know the type of tool_params and of the all_cpus member (is it a pointer type, e.g. char * or some pointer-to-flag?) to determine if a pointer is involved and whether it ought to be const-qualified.\n\n- num_threads (declaration and type): The function assigns into num_threads. We need its declaration to confirm it is not a pointer (and therefore not subject to the pointer const rule) or to find out if it is a pointer/typedef that requires const qualification.\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count (prototype and any typedefs in its signature): The call could return or take pointer types; the function's prototype (and any typedefs it uses) is required to determine whether any pointer appears in its return type or parameters that would need const qualification.\n\n- get_cpu_core_count (prototype and any typedefs in its signature): Same rationale as for get_process_cpu_core_count \u2014 we need the exact signature/typedefs to see if pointer types are involved.\n\n- print_all_cores_used (prototype): Although called with no arguments here, its declaration confirms whether it uses any pointer parameters or global pointers that could be relevant to const qualification analysis.\n\n- printf (prototype from <stdio.h>): The format string passed to printf is a string literal; we should confirm the prototype uses const char * for the format parameter (standard printf does). Including printf's declaration verifies there is no pointer mismatch that would affect MISRA compliance.\n\nIf any of the above prototypes use typedefs or other type declarations, those typedefs/type declarations should also be provided (they are included under the noted items) so the pointer const-qualification can be checked transitively."
