  "explanation": "- tool_params (and its member all_cpus): The first controlling expression is \"if (! tool_params.all_cpus)\". You must see the definition and all writers/initializers of tool_params.all_cpus to determine whether that value can vary at runtime or is a compile-time/never-changed invariant. Include any code that parses/initializes/modifies tool_params (the structure definition and any assignment sites).\n\n- num_threads (declaration and linkage): The second controlling expression compares get_cpu_core_count() to num_threads. You need the declaration and storage class of num_threads (global vs local, volatile qualifier) and any other writers to know whether its value is invariant at the point of the if.\n\n- get_process_cpu_core_count: Its return is assigned to num_threads; you must inspect its implementation to determine whether it can return a value that changes across runs or calls (or is a compile-time constant). This affects whether subsequent comparisons can be invariant.\n\n- detect_process_cpu_core_count: get_process_cpu_core_count calls this helper (per the call graph). Its behavior (reads runtime state, caches results, constant return, use of system APIs) determines whether get_process_cpu_core_count is invariant.\n\n- get_cpu_core_count: This function is used directly in the controlling expression. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it always returns an unchanging constant, reads dynamic system state, caches values, or is otherwise invariant.\n\n- detect_cpu_core_count: get_cpu_core_count delegates to this; its behavior (runtime detection vs constant) is needed to judge invariance of get_cpu_core_count.\n\n- check_apply_params: This is the caller of check_apply_param__all_cpus. You need to understand the call context and the program initialization sequence (e.g., whether tool_params is still being modified later or has been finalized) to decide if the controlling expression can vary. Include this caller to see ordering and earlier initialization.\n\n- main: The program entry (caller of check_apply_params) helps determine overall initialization order and whether values that affect the condition can change before/after this call.\n\n- check_apply_param__threads: This sibling function (called from the same check_apply_params sequence and shown in the call graph) may also read/write num_threads or related globals; its code is required to ensure there are no interleaved modifications that would affect whether the comparisons in check_apply_param__all_cpus are invariant.\n\n(Only these symbols are required to judge whether the two controlling expressions in check_apply_param__all_cpus are invariant under MISRA C rule \u2014 inspect their definitions and any writers/initializers to conclude whether the conditions are constant.)"
