  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided function. I inspected the code for common compiler/extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin__ constructs, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), __declspec, __inline__ non-standard keywords, or other vendor-specific language keywords). None are present. The platform-specific APIs (clock_gettime, mach clock_get_time, GetTickCount64, QueryPerformanceCounter, gethrtime) and types (clockid_t, mach_timespec_t, LARGE_INTEGER, uint64_t, time_t) are library/OS APIs or standard C/C99 types, not language extensions. Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef/#if) and the casts used are standard C. Although some identifiers use leading underscores (e.g. _MHD_UNWANTED_CLOCK), and the code is platform-specific, these are not compiler language extensions per se. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
