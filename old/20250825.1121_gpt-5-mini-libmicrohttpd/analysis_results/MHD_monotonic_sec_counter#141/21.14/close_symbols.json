  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_monotonic_sec_counter (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analysis must consider all callees and externally referenced symbols that are reachable from this function and that could themselves use memcmp (or expand to calls that do). Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- clock_gettime: called directly; its implementation (or functions it calls) must be inspected for any memcmp use.\n- clock_get_time: called directly (the Mach alternative); its implementation may call into code that uses memcmp.\n- GetTickCount64: called on Windows path; ensure this wrapper/alt implementation does not hide a memcmp use.\n- QueryPerformanceCounter: called on older Windows path; its implementation or wrappers could contain memcmp.\n- gethrtime: called on HAVE_GETHRTIME path; inspect its implementation for memcmp usage.\n- time: fallback call at function end; inspect its implementation/wrappers for memcmp usage.\n\n- mono_clock_start: global used in arithmetic and return values. Although a time origin (not a string) its initializer or setter routines could be implemented in code that uses memcmp; include to track reachability.\n- mono_clock_id: controls branch into clock_gettime path; its definition (could be a macro/enum) or any accessor might hide calls that use memcmp.\n- _MHD_UNWANTED_CLOCK: macro/constant used in the conditional; include because macro expansions or related code may reference other functions.\n- mono_clock_service: used for the Mach clock branch; its definition/initializer might involve code that uses memcmp.\n- _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV: macro/constant used in the Mach branch condition; include for same reason as other macros.\n- KERN_SUCCESS: return code compared against clock_get_time result; include because related headers or wrappers could hide additional calls.\n\n- tick_start: used to compute return value on Windows; its initializer or code that updates it might contain memcmp uses and should be examined.\n- perf_freq: used to select QueryPerformanceCounter branch; include because its set-up code could use memcmp.\n- perf_start: used in the perf counter arithmetic; include to examine initialization code for memcmp.\n- hrtime_start: used in gethrtime arithmetic; include to inspect initialisation code.\n- sys_clock_start: used in fallback return time(NULL) - sys_clock_start; include to inspect initialisation code for memcmp.\n\nNotes: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings anywhere in code reachable from the target function. Practically, that means you must inspect the bodies (or linked wrappers) of all called functions above and any initialization routines or macros that can be reached from this function. The list above covers direct callees and the external globals/macros that control branches or supply return values; inspecting those symbols (their definitions and any functions they reference) is sufficient to decide whether a memcmp-on-NT-string violation is reachable from MHD_monotonic_sec_counter."
