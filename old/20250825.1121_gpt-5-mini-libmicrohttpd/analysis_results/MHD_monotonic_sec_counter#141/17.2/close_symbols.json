  "explanation": "For determining whether MHD_monotonic_sec_counter can call itself (directly or indirectly) the analyzer must know the definitions/semantics of every called symbol and the compile-time conditions that enable those calls:\n\n- clock_gettime: Called directly under HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME; its implementation (or macro wrapper) could call back into MHD_monotonic_sec_counter.\n- clock_get_time: Mach API called under HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME; must check its definition/implementation for possible indirect recursion.\n- GetTickCount64: Windows API called on newer Windows; include to ensure it does not resolve to a wrapper that calls the target.\n- QueryPerformanceCounter: Called on older Windows path; its implementation/wrapper could cause indirect recursion.\n- gethrtime: Called under HAVE_GETHRTIME; include to check for possible callbacks into the target.\n- time: Fallback call at end; standard library time() could be wrapped/overridden in the build and might call the target.\n\n- HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME, HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME, _WIN32, _WIN32_WINNT, HAVE_GETHRTIME: Conditional-compilation macros controlling which call sites are present. The analyzer needs these to know which calls are actually compiled into the function and therefore which call-edges to consider.\n\n- _MHD_UNWANTED_CLOCK, _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV: Macros/constants used in conditional tests; include them to understand which branches may be taken and whether the corresponding call sites are reachable.\n\n- mono_clock_id, mono_clock_start, mono_clock_service, tick_start, perf_freq, perf_start, hrtime_start, sys_clock_start: Global symbols read/used by the function. They must be checked to ensure none are macros or function-pointer-like entities (e.g., a macro expanding to a function call or a function pointer object that when invoked elsewhere could form an indirect recursion path).\n\n- KERN_SUCCESS: Used to test return value from clock_get_time; included to understand control flow for that branch.\n\nIn short: include every directly called function (and any symbol that might be a macro wrapper) plus the conditional macros and globals used in branch selection so the subsequent analysis can build an accurate call graph and determine if any called symbol (directly or via macro/wrapper) can lead back to MHD_monotonic_sec_counter."
