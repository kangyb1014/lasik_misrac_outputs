  "explanation": "For determining unreachable code in MHD_monotonic_sec_counter you must know which conditional compilation branches are present (compile-time macros) and the possible runtime outcomes of the run-time conditions and function calls that control early returns. Each symbol is required for the following reason:\n\n- HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME: controls whether the clock_gettime block is compiled \u2014 necessary to know if that branch exists at all.\n- HAVE_CLOCK_GET_TIME: controls whether the Mach clock_get_time block is compiled.\n- _WIN32: controls whether Windows-specific code is compiled.\n- _WIN32_WINNT: selects which Windows sub-branch (GetTickCount64 vs QueryPerformanceCounter) is compiled.\n- HAVE_GETHRTIME: controls whether the gethrtime() block is compiled.\n\n- mono_clock_id: runtime value tested against _MHD_UNWANTED_CLOCK; needed to decide if the clock_gettime branch's if condition can be true.\n- _MHD_UNWANTED_CLOCK: constant compared to mono_clock_id; needed to evaluate that condition.\n- clock_gettime: its return value (0 on success) is used in the conjunction determining whether that branch returns \u2014 needed to know if the return statement can execute.\n- mono_clock_start: used in the return expression; knowing it is not required for reachability itself but needed to ensure the return is meaningful and not optimized away.\n\n- mono_clock_service: runtime value tested against _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV for the Mach path; required to assess reachability of that return.\n- _MHD_INVALID_CLOCK_SERV: constant compared to mono_clock_service; required to evaluate the Mach-path guard.\n- clock_get_time: its return code is compared to KERN_SUCCESS to decide whether that branch returns \u2014 needed to determine reachability.\n- KERN_SUCCESS: constant compared against clock_get_time result; required to interpret that test.\n\n- tick_start: used by GetTickCount64 path; required to check whether that Windows return path is reachable and what it computes.\n- GetTickCount64: presence/semantics of this API determine whether the if-1 return under _WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0600 is reachable/valid.\n- perf_freq: tested for non-zero to enter the QueryPerformanceCounter path; its value decides whether that Windows path can run.\n- QueryPerformanceCounter: used to obtain perf_counter; its availability/semantics affect reachability and whether the return executes.\n- perf_start: used in the QueryPerformanceCounter return expression; needed to reason about the return but primarily to ensure that the branch is non-trivial.\n\n- gethrtime: presence/semantics of this API determine whether the HAVE_GETHRTIME block's if(1) return is compiled and reachable.\n- hrtime_start: used in gethrtime() return expression; required to check meaningfulness of that return.\n\n- time: fallback call used in the final return; needed because if all earlier branches are absent or cannot return, this final return is the reachable fallback.\n- sys_clock_start: used in the final return expression; needed to ensure the final return is not dead code.\n\nIn short: the compile-time macros determine which code blocks exist; the listed globals/constants/functions determine whether the if-tests and API calls inside those blocks can succeed and cause the function to return early. Without these symbols (their definitions/values/semantics) you cannot conclude whether some return statements or entire blocks are unreachable (violate the MISRA rule)."
