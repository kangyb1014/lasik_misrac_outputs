  "explanation": "- MHD_is_feature_supported: The target function calls this routine. To determine whether the call chain uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings we must inspect MHD_is_feature_supported's implementation. If memcmp is used there to compare feature names (null\u2011terminated C strings), that would be a MISRA violation relevant to this target function.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule is about use of the standard function memcmp for comparing null\u2011terminated strings. The presence/use of the memcmp symbol in the implementation(s) reachable from the target function is what we are checking for; include it so the next agent searches for its usage and call patterns.\n- MHD_FEATURE_POLL: This symbol is the feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported. We need to know its type (e.g. a const char * string or an enum/integer). If it is a null\u2011terminated string, comparing it with memcmp would be a violation; if it is an enum/integer, memcmp would not be applicable.\n- feature name table / feature strings used by MHD_is_feature_supported: If MHD_is_feature_supported compares the queried feature against an internal table of feature names, we must inspect those string definitions and how comparisons are implemented (strcmp/strncmp/memcmp/etc.). This helps determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n- MHD_NO: Included to understand return value semantics of MHD_is_feature_supported (how success/failure is signaled). Not directly about memcmp, but needed to fully interpret the target function's logic when tracing into MHD_is_feature_supported."
