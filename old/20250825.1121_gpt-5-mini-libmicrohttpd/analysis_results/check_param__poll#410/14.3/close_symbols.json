  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to assess MISRA C rule (invariant controlling expressions):\n\n- tool_params\n  - You must see the declaration/definition of the global (or file-scope) tool_params object to determine whether it is mutable at runtime, declared const, or otherwise invariant. The MISRA rule is concerned with whether the controlling expression can vary; knowing the variable\u2019s storage class, qualifiers (const/volatile) and where it is defined is required.\n\n- tool_params.poll\n  - The controlling expression in the first if is \"! tool_params.poll\". You need the exact type and declaration of the poll member (type, signed/unsigned/boolean, const/volatile) and any initialization or assignments to that member to decide if the expression is invariant. If poll is a compile-time constant or never modified, the if would be an invariant condition.\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported\n  - The second if uses the return value of this function. You must examine its prototype/implementation to know whether it can produce different results at runtime (has side effects, reads runtime state) or is implemented as a compile-time constant/macro/inline that always returns the same value for MHD_FEATURE_POLL. If it is effectively constant, the controlling expression could be invariant.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_POLL\n  - This identifier may be a macro/enum that affects MHD_is_feature_supported\u2019s behavior. If MHD_FEATURE_POLL is conditionally defined or alters the function into a no-op, the comparison could reduce to a constant. You need its definition to decide invariance.\n\n- MHD_NO\n  - This constant (macro/enum) is used in the comparison. Knowing its definition and type is necessary to determine if the equality test can be resolved at compile time (e.g., if MHD_is_feature_supported is a macro that expands to a constant) or if the comparison is genuinely dynamic.\n\n(Other symbols such as fprintf and stderr do not affect whether the controlling expressions are invariant; they only affect side effects inside the guarded block.)"
