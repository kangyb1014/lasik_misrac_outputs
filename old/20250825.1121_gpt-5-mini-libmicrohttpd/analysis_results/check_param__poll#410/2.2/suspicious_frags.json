Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function (the signature, braces, the fprintf call and the feature-check condition) are not flagged because they are structural or have observable side effects or control-flow effects: the fprintf emits output (observable behaviour) and the conditional checks determine whether that output occurs. There is no unreachable code in the snippet (all branches can be taken depending on runtime state), and initialization/assignment distinctions do not apply. Therefore only the return expressions/lines shown above are identified as suspicious and warrant investigation for potential dead/redundant behaviour."
