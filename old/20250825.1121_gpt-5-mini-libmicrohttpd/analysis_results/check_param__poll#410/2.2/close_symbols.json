  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n\n- tool_params (definition and initialization sites, especially where .poll is assigned): check_param__poll branches on tool_params.poll. To determine whether any branch (and therefore the body of the function) is ever executed or is redundant, you must know how and when .poll can be set or cleared. If .poll is never set to true in the project, the branch that tests MHD_is_feature_supported (and the fprintf inside it) may be dead.\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported (implementation): the function call determines whether the unsupported-path (fprintf + return 0) can be reached. If its implementation (or build-time configuration) guarantees a constant return (e.g. always supported or always unsupported), the reachable code paths in check_param__poll could be constant and thus may render parts of the function dead.\n\n- MHD_NO (macro/enum value): the comparison uses MHD_NO. You need the exact value/semantics of MHD_NO to interpret the test MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported(...). It may be an enum or macro whose meaning affects reachability.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_POLL (macro/enum value): the feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported. Its presence/definition and any compile-time configuration that affects support must be known to determine whether the unsupported branch can occur.\n\n- check_apply_params (caller and its use of check_param__poll return): dead-code analysis for a function must include how its results affect program behaviour. If the caller ignores the return value or treats it in a way that makes the function\u2019s effects irrelevant, then parts of the function could be dead. Inspecting check_apply_params (how it calls and handles check_param__poll) is necessary to decide whether removing the function or parts of it would change behaviour.\n\n- main (to see how check_apply_params result influences program behaviour): to complete the call chain you must know whether the value/side-effects from check_apply_params (and therefore from check_param__poll) affect program control flow or output (for example, aborting startup). If they do, removal would change behaviour; if they do not, the function may be dead.\n\n- fprintf / stderr (declarations/semantics): printing to stderr is a visible side-effect. To decide if the fprintf call is dead you must confirm it has observable effect in the target environment (and is not compiled out or redirected); removing a visible print is a behavioural change, so it must be treated as live unless shown otherwise.\n\n- build configuration macros that control MHD_FEATURE_POLL availability: many feature-support decisions are resolved at build time by macros. Knowing those macros (and any conditional compilation that affects MHD_is_feature_supported or FEATURE_POLL) is necessary to determine whether the unsupported branch can ever be true in the built program.\n\nThese symbols together let the next analyst determine (1) whether the conditional branches in check_param__poll can be reached, (2) whether their side-effects (fprintf/return value) influence program behaviour, and thus (3) whether any operations in the function constitute dead code under the MISRA rule."
