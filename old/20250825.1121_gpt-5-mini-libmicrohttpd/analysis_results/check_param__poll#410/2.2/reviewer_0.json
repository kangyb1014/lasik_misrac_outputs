Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of check_param__poll.\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_param__poll (void)\n{\n  if (! tool_params.poll)\n    return ! 0;\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_POLL))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"poll() was requested, but this MHD build does not \"\n             \"support polling by poll().\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false). True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe operation '!' applied to the constant 0 in the statement 'return ! 0;' is redundant. The logical negation of constant 0 always yields 1, so the '!' operation is executed but its removal (e.g. replacing with 'return 1;') would not affect program behavior. This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids dead code \u2014 operations/statements that are executed but whose removal (i.e. removing that statement entirely so the program no longer does that action) would not change program behaviour. In this function the return statements are required for control flow; the uses of !0 are simply a way to produce the constant value 1. Replacing \"return !0;\" with the semantically equivalent \"return 1;\" is a source-level simplification/refactor, not removal of an executed statement that would leave behaviour unchanged. In other words nothing in the function is an executed statement that can be deleted without changing the program's behaviour. (Compiler constant folding or micro-optimizations do not turn this into a Rule 2.2 violation.)\n\nRecommendation: if the style is a concern, prefer an explicit literal or a named boolean constant (e.g. return 1; or return true; / a defined macro) for clarity, but this is a readability/style issue, not a Rule 2.2 dead-code violation."
