  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of check_param__poll:\n```c\nstatic int\ncheck_param__poll (void)\n{\n  if (! tool_params.poll)\n    return ! 0;\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_POLL))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"poll() was requested, but this MHD build does not \"\n             \"support polling by poll().\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_POLL))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"poll() was requested, but this MHD build does not \"\n             \"support polling by poll().\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is conditional and observable (it prints an error and returns 0 when MHD_is_feature_supported(MHD_FEATURE_POLL) == MHD_NO). Removing it would change program behaviour when polling is requested but not supported, so it is not dead code."
