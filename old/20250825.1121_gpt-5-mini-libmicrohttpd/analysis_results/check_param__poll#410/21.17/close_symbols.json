  "explanation": "MHD_is_feature_supported: The target function calls this function. Its implementation must be inspected to see whether it calls any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strlen, strcmp, etc.) or otherwise performs string/ buffer operations that could violate the MISRA string-bounds rule.\n\ntool_params: The member tool_params.poll is read in the function. The definition of tool_params (its type and members) must be checked to ensure that accessing .poll does not involve any hidden string-pointer or buffer operations and to confirm .poll is a simple scalar rather than an alias to some string/buffer object.\n\nMHD_NO: The constant used in the comparison with MHD_is_feature_supported\u2019s return value must be known (macro/enum/type) to verify the comparison is well-typed and does not involve pointer-to-string semantics that could hide string operations.\n\nMHD_FEATURE_POLL: The feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported must be inspected (macro/enum/type) to ensure it is not a pointer to or derived from a string buffer; if it were, the called function might perform string operations on it.\n\nfprintf: The function uses fprintf to print an error message. While fprintf is from <stdio.h>, its use must be considered to rule out any indirect use of <string.h> routines in project wrappers or local replacements; also check that the format string and arguments do not involve any project-defined formatting helpers that use string.h functions.\n\nstderr: The stderr symbol (stream passed to fprintf) should be confirmed to be the standard stream (not shadowed by a project symbol) so that printing does not route through project code that might invoke string.h functions.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal additional items needed to determine whether the target function or anything it directly invokes performs operations from <string.h> that could access out-of-bounds memory."
