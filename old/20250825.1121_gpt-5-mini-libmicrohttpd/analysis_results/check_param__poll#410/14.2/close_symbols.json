The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is required for a complete MISRA for-loop analysis of check_param__poll:\n\n- tool_params (definition of the object/struct): need the type/definition of the global tool_params object to determine the type and semantics of any members; if tool_params were implemented via macros or accessor functions that expand to for-loops or side-effecting expressions, that could affect compliance.\n\n- tool_params.poll (declaration/type of the poll member): the second-clause of a for-loop must not use objects that are modified by the loop body; knowing whether poll is a simple scalar/boolean, macro, or accessor is required to decide whether its use has side-effects or is modified elsewhere.\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported (prototype and implementation): the function is called from the target. If the target had a for loop that invoked this function in one of its clauses or body, the behaviour of that for loop includes behaviour of called functions. To conclude whether any for-loop usage would violate the rule (e.g. by causing persistent side-effects or modifying loop control objects), the implementation/prototype of this function must be examined.\n\n- MHD_NO (macro/enum definition): it participates in the comparison; if MHD_NO is a macro or expression with side-effects (unlikely but possible via macro expansion) it could affect whether any for-loop clause is side-effect free.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_POLL (macro/enum definition): same rationale as MHD_NO \u2014 need to know it is a simple constant and not a macro that expands to code with side-effects.\n\n- fprintf (declaration/implementation or linkage to stdio): fprintf is called in the function body. If a for loop in this function were to call fprintf (directly in a clause or body), fprintf's behaviour would be part of the loop body behaviour; its signature/behaviour must be known to reason about side-effects. At minimum, confirm it is a standard library function with side-effects (I/O) so it cannot be used in a for-clause that must be side-effect free.\n\n- stderr (definition/extern object): used as an argument to fprintf. If macros or definitions alter stderr or if it is a macro expanding to function calls, that could introduce side-effects. Verifying it is a simple extern FILE* lets you conclude about side-effects.\n\nNote: The target function as given contains no for-loops. The listed symbols are the minimal set to inspect to be certain that none of the referenced identifiers/macros/functions expand or behave in a way that would create or affect for-loop well-formedness (for example via macro expansions or inline definitions)."
