  "explanation": "Provide these symbols so the next analyst can determine whether any pointer in check_param__poll should be const-qualified:\n\n- tool_params: the declaration/type of the global structure (or variable) containing .poll is needed to know whether poll is a pointer type and, if so, whether it should be declared as pointing-to-const. If poll is not a pointer, the MISRA pointer rule is irrelevant for it.\n- tool_params.poll: the specific member type is required to decide if it is a pointer and whether it already points to a const-qualified type or should be changed.\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: the function prototype is needed to see whether it takes or returns any pointer types; if it accepts pointer arguments they must be checked for const-qualification where appropriate.\n- MHD_NO: the definition/type (macro or enum) is needed to confirm the comparison MHD_NO == MHD_is_feature_supported(...) does not involve pointer types (and so is irrelevant for the pointer const rule) or to see if it is a pointer-like token in this build.\n- MHD_FEATURE_POLL: its type/definition is required to know whether it is an integer/enum or a pointer, so the call argument to MHD_is_feature_supported can be evaluated for pointer constness.\n- fprintf: the prototype (from the C library) is required because it takes a format string (const char *) and a FILE *; the analysis needs to know whether the parameters used here conform to const-correctness (string literal -> const char *), and whether passing stderr (a FILE *) raises any const-pointer concerns.\n- stderr: the declaration/type of stderr (FILE *) is needed because it is a pointer; the MISRA rule may require checking whether that pointer should be to a const-qualified FILE type in this usage.\n- FILE: the FILE type definition/representation may be needed to determine whether any pointer to FILE used here should be const-qualified under the rule.\n\nIncluding these symbols (and their headers/declarations) lets the analyzer determine whether any pointer usage inside check_param__poll violates the MISRA rule about preferring pointers-to-const wherever possible."
