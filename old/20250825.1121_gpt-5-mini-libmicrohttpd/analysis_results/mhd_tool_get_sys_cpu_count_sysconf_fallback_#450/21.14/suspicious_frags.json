  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 prohibits using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp (nor any other memory comparison of char buffers). It only uses integer types and sysconf, with comparisons and casts on long/int values. There are no char* or string literal comparisons, no uses of memcmp/memcmp-like patterns, and the feature-test macros (HAVE_SYSCONF, HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) only control which sysconf constants are used. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
