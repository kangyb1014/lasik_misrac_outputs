  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule (memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings):\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule is about use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. To determine if the target function (or anything it invokes) violates the rule you must know whether memcmp is referenced directly or indirectly. Include memcmp so the analyser can check for any direct call or indirect usage (e.g. via wrapper macros or inlined helpers).\n\n- sysconf: The target calls sysconf (depending on configuration). Although sysconf typically does not operate on strings, its implementation or a platform-specific wrapper could conceivably call library routines that use memcmp. The analyser needs the sysconf symbol (declaration/definition or wrapper macro) to inspect whether it leads to memcmp usage.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF: This compile-time macro controls whether the sysconf-based code path is compiled in. The analyser must know its value to decide if the conditional code that might reference sysconf (and thereby any indirect memcmp usage) is active.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU and HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These macros control which _SC_* constants are used and therefore which sysconf calls are compiled. Their values determine which calls are present in the compiled function and therefore whether the sysconf symbol (or any wrapper that might use memcmp) is actually invoked.\n\n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU and _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These constants are arguments to sysconf; on some platforms they may be defined via macros that expand to expressions or may be tied to platform-specific headers that introduce wrappers. The analyser should inspect their definitions to ensure they are plain integer constants and do not hide any string comparisons (or macros that expand to code invoking string routines).\n\nRationale summary: The target function itself contains no obvious use of memcmp or string operations. To be certain it does not violate the MISRA memcmp rule you must (1) check for any direct use of memcmp in the function, and (2) check any function or macro it invokes (notably sysconf or platform-specific wrappers) for indirect memcmp usage. The listed symbols are the minimal set required to perform that check and to decide which conditional branches are actually compiled."
