  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs and standard/preprocessor macros: conditional compilation (#if defined / #ifdef / #endif), integer types (int, long), ordinary casts ((int) value), standard function call (sysconf), and C comments. There are no GCC/Clang-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __typeof__, statement-expressions ({: ... :}), nested functions, inline assembly (asm), __builtin_* usage, or other compiler-specific keywords. The POSIX sysconf and _SC_* macros are library/OS interfaces rather than compiler language extensions, so they do not trigger Rule 1.2 reporting. Therefore no fragments require investigation for use of language extensions."
