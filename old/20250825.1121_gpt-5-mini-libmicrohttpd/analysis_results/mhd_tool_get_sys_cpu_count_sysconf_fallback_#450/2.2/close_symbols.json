  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA dead-code analysis of mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_:\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF: Controls whether the entire sysconf-based block is compiled. If undefined the whole block is removed by the preprocessor; to decide whether code is present (and thus potentially dead) we must know this macro.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU: Controls inclusion of the branch that calls sysconf(_SC_CRAY_NCPU). Knowing whether this macro is defined determines whether that call and the surrounding conditional are present and possibly dead.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: Controls inclusion of the branch that calls sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF). Same rationale as above for the other branch.\n\n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU: The constant passed to sysconf; its presence/definition is tied to whether that sysconf call is valid. Also platform-specific meanings could affect whether sysconf returns meaningful values (affects whether removal would change behaviour).\n\n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: Same as above for the other sysconf argument.\n\n- sysconf: The function called by the target. To judge whether removing the sysconf calls (or the whole function) would affect program behaviour we must know sysconf's prototype, return semantics (when it returns -1 vs valid results), and whether it has side effects (e.g. modifies errno or other global state). If sysconf has side effects, calls are not dead even if their return value is unused elsewhere.\n\n- errno: sysconf may set errno on failure. Knowledge of whether errno is observed elsewhere (or whether sysconf modifies errno as a side-effect) is needed to determine whether the call's removal would change observable program behaviour.\n\n- INT_MAX, INT_MIN, LONG_MAX, LONG_MIN: Limits on int and long are required to determine if the overflow check (if ((long) ret != value)) can ever be true. If the ranges make that check impossible (or always true) then that check (and its return) may be dead or essential. These macros let us decide whether that code is redundant (dead) or required.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count: The immediate caller shown in the call graph. To decide if this function is ever executed in the program (i.e. whether it is reachable at runtime) and whether removing it would affect behaviour, the caller's usage and build-time decisions must be inspected.\n\n- detect_cpu_core_count: Shown as the upstream caller of mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count in the call graph. Including it (or the calling chain) helps assess the runtime reachability and importance of the target function in the overall program behaviour; if the whole call chain is never used under product configuration, the function may be unreachable or effectively dead.\n\nNotes: The listed preprocessor macros and platform constants determine which source lines exist in the compiled binary; sysconf/errno semantics and integer limits determine whether executed operations have observable side effects or are redundant. Those are the necessary symbols to decide if any executed operation in the function is removable without changing program behaviour (MISRA dead-code)."
