  "explanation": "No pointer objects or pointer types appear in the provided function, so there are no places where a pointer could/should point to a const-qualified type. Specifically:\n- Function signature: returns int, no pointer parameters.\n- Local variables: \"int ret\" and \"long value\" \u2014 both non-pointer scalar types.\n- Calls and casts: sysconf() returns a long (not a pointer) and there are only integer casts (long to int), no pointer casts.\n- No pointer arithmetic, no pointer dereferences, no pointer-to-function usage, and no conversions between pointer and non-const pointer types.\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in this function relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 that require investigation."
