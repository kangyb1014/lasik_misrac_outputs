  "explanation": "- sysconf: The function calls sysconf; to check the MISRA pointer rule we must know its declaration/signature (typically long sysconf(int)). If sysconf had a pointer parameter or returned a pointer (or were a macro wrapping pointer-typed code) that could trigger the rule. Confirming its prototype ensures no pointer usage is hidden in the call.  \n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU and _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These macros are passed to sysconf. Knowing their types (integer constants) confirms that no pointer is being passed. If they were defined as expressions involving pointers, that would matter for the pointer/const analysis.  \n- HAVE_SYSCONF, HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU, HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These configuration macros control whether the sysconf-related block is compiled. To analyze whether any pointer-related code is present in the compiled function we must know which of these are defined; otherwise we cannot be certain whether sysconf calls (or any other code involving pointers) are part of the build.  \n- <unistd.h>: This header normally declares sysconf and the _SC_* constants. Examining the actual header used on the target platform ensures there is no unexpected redefinition of sysconf or the constants that would introduce pointer usage.  \nTogether these symbols let an analyst verify that the function performs only integer/long operations and does not use pointers (or hide pointer usage via macros), which is necessary to determine compliance with the MISRA rule about const-qualified pointer types."
