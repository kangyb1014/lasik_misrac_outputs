  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for invariant controlling expressions\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF\n  - Determines whether the whole block that declares `value` and contains the runtime `if` checks is compiled at all. If this macro is not defined the runtime conditionals do not exist, so the MISRA analysis outcome changes.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU and HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF\n  - Control which of the two `if (0 >= value) value = sysconf(...);` branches are present. Different combinations change whether the `if` tests are present and whether they are evaluated in sequence, which affects whether a controlling expression is effectively invariant at the point it appears.\n\n- sysconf\n  - The `if` conditions guard calls to `sysconf` and depend on whether those calls update `value`. To decide if `if (0 >= value)` is invariant you must know whether `sysconf(...)` is a normal function returning a non-constant value, or could be a macro/constant (or behave in a way that makes `value` effectively constant). Also `sysconf` may have side-effects or error returns that influence subsequent evaluations of the same controlling expression; this affects whether the expression is invariant across executions.\n\n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU and _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF\n  - These constants are the arguments passed to `sysconf`. Their definitions can affect how `sysconf` behaves (and in some environments they might be undefined or mapped to different values). Knowing their presence/definitions helps determine whether the `sysconf` call can change `value`, and therefore whether the surrounding `if` tests are invariant.\n\nIn short: the MISRA concern is whether the controlling expressions (notably the repeated `if (0 >= value)` checks and the `if ((long) ret != value)` overflow test) are constant at runtime. That determination depends on which blocks are compiled (the three preprocessor macros) and on the semantics/definition of `sysconf` and the `_SC_*` constants (whether the call can change `value` or is effectively constant). These symbols are therefore required for an accurate MISRA C invariant-control check."
