  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. At the point each if(0 >= value) is evaluated, value has just been initialised to the constant -1 and has not been modified, so the controlling expression is effectively constant true at that evaluation. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 prohibits invariant controlling expressions (no applicable exception applies here), so this is a violation.\n\nPractical fixes include restructuring so the first sysconf call is performed without testing a freshly initialised sentinel (e.g. use #elif to select which sysconf to call, or call sysconf directly in the guarded branches and only test value after a call), or use an explicit flag to indicate whether value has been set, thus avoiding a controlling expression that is provably invariant at the point of evaluation."
