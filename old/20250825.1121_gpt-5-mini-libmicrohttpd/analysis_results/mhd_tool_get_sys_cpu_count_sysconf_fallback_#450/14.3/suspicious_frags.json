  "explanation": "Other controlling expressions in the function do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: the preprocessor conditionals (#if / #ifdef) are compile-time directives, not runtime controlling expressions governed by this rule; the check if ((long) ret != value) depends on runtime-converted values and can legitimately vary (it detects overflow) and is not an invariant; return statements, assignments and the variable declarations/initializations themselves are not controlling expressions. Therefore only the three occurrences of the if (0 >= value) controlling expressions are potential invariants that should be investigated."
