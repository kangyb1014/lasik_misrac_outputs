  "explanation": "Given the provided macro definitions, the remainder of the function is part of the compiled translation unit and its execution paths depend on the runtime return value of sysconf(), so those statements are not statically unreachable: the if-guards before each sysconf call depend on the mutable variable 'value' (initialized to -1) and thus can evaluate either way at runtime; the subsequent check for non-positive value and the overflow check depend on the sysconf result and are therefore reachable. No other code fragments in the function are obviously unreachable under the current build configuration and realistic runtime outcomes, so they do not require investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1."
