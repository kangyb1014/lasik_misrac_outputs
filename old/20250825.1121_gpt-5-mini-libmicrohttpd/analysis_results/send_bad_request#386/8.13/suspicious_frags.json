  "explanation": "The MISRA 8.13 concern is about pointers that could/should point to const-qualified types. The only places in the provided code where a pointer to static string data is used are the macro BAD_REQUEST_PAGE (which expands to a string literal) and the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static that passes that data (with an explicit cast). These fragments should be investigated to confirm whether the API being called expects a const-qualified pointer or a non-const pointer and whether the macro should be a const-qualified object instead of a plain string literal macro. Other lines in send_bad_request (local variable declarations, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response, return) do not involve passing this static string data or changing pointer constness and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 based on the supplied code."
