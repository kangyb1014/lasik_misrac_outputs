  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The function parameter 'con' is only passed to other functions (MHD_queue_response) and is not assigned to or otherwise changed. The pointer itself is not altered; only local variables 'res' and 'ret' are used. The object pointed to by 'con' is not directly modified here either. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
