  "explanation": "No direct use of the standard library function memcmp is present in the supplied code, so there are no explicit memcmp calls to report. However, the call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ is a binary string comparison helper that may internally use memcmp; therefore it must be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Also the call site in MHD_lookup_connection_value computes the length with strlen(key) and passes that length to the comparison path \u2014 this use of strlen together with a binary comparison could still result in memcmp being applied to null-terminated strings and should be reviewed. Other code fragments (NULL checks, pointer equality tests (key == pos->header), header_size comparisons, assignments and the return paths) do not perform string comparisons themselves and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.14."
