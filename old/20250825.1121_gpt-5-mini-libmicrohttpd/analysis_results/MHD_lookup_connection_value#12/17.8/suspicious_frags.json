  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning: \n- There are three parameters: connection, kind, and key. None of these parameters is assigned to anywhere in the function (no statements like connection = ..., kind = ..., or key = ...). \n- The only operation involving key is the guarded strlen call ((NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen (key)), which does not modify the pointer parameter and avoids calling strlen when key is NULL. \n- The call to MHD_lookup_connection_value_n passes connection and key but does not itself modify this function\u2019s parameter variables; modifications inside the callee are outside the scope of this function\u2019s parameter modification check. \n- The local variable value is passed by address (&value) to the callee; value is a local variable, not a parameter, so writing to it via the callee is permitted. \nBecause no parameter variables are assigned to or otherwise altered in this function, there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 17.8."
