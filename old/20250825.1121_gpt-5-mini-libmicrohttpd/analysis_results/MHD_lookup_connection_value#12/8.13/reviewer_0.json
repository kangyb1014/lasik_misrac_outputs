If MHD_lookup_connection_value_n does not modify the connection object, then the pointer should be const-qualified. To comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, change the prototype to 'const struct MHD_Connection *connection' and propagate const to called functions as needed.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone. The wrapper itself does not modify *connection, but it passes connection to MHD_lookup_connection_value_n. Whether the pointer can be const depends on the called function(s) and the wider API: if MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (or other callees) have non-const parameter types or actually modify the connection, then the wrapper cannot legitimately change its parameter to 'const struct MHD_Connection *' without changing those callees or breaking the API. MISRA C 2023 R8.13 indeed recommends qualifying pointers as pointing-to-const where possible, but you must verify the entire call chain and whether any modifications occur. Without inspecting the signature and behavior of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (and any other usages), you cannot conclude a definite violation. Therefore the report is not demonstrably correct from the provided code alone."
