  "explanation": "I did not flag other fragments because they do not present obvious potential violations of Rule 8.13: the 'key' parameter is already declared as 'const char *', the local variable 'const char *value;' and the function return type 'const char *' are const-qualified, and the strlen(key) call takes a const char * as expected. The remaining simple assignments (value = NULL;) and the (void) cast to ignore the return value do not affect pointer const-qualification. The two fragments reported cover places where pointer-to-non-const might be used (the connection parameter and the call that passes both 'connection' and '&value') and thus should be investigated to ensure pointers are const-qualified where possible."
