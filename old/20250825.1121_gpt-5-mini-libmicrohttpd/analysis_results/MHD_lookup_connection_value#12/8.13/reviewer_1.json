True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe local variable is declared as 'const char * value;' so '&value' has type 'const char **'. If the function MHD_lookup_connection_value_n is prototyped to take a non-const output pointer (e.g. a parameter of type 'char **value_out' or 'char * *'), then passing '&value' implicitly attempts to convert 'const char **' to 'char **', which violates const-correctness and therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, MHD_lookup_connection_value_n's prototype expects 'const char **' or 'const char * const *', then no violation occurs.)\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s reasoning is correct in principle but incomplete on the facts. The snippet itself does not prove a violation: the call passes &value where value is declared const char *. Whether this violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 depends on the prototype of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n.\n\n- If MHD_lookup_connection_value_n expects a non-const pointer (e.g. char ** or char * *), then passing &value (type const char **) discards the const qualifier and is a const-correctness mismatch. That would be a violation (and also an incompatible pointer type in ISO C), so Agent A\u2019s claim would be correct in that case. \n\n- If MHD_lookup_connection_value_n is declared to accept const char ** or const char * const *, then no qualifier is discarded and there is no violation of Rule 8.13.\n\nConclusion: the report is not definitively correct from the code shown \u2014 it is only correct if the callee\u2019s prototype uses a non-const output pointer. Verify the declaration of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n; if it takes a non-const char **, change the prototype to use const char ** (or otherwise fix the types) to satisfy MISRA 8.13."
