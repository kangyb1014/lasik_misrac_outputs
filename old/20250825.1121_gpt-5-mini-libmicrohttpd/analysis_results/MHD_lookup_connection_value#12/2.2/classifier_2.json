  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_lookup_connection_value:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN const char *\nMHD_lookup_connection_value (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                             enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                             const char *key)\n{\n  const char *value;\n\n  value = NULL;\n  (void) MHD_lookup_connection_value_n (connection,\n                                        kind,\n                                        key,\n                                        (NULL == key) ? 0 : strlen (key),\n                                        &value,\n                                        NULL);\n  return value;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_lookup_connection_value:\n_MHD_EXTERN enum MHD_Result\nMHD_lookup_connection_value_n (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                               enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                               const char *key,\n                               size_t key_size,\n                               const char **value_ptr,\n                               size_t *value_size_ptr)\n{\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if (NULL == connection)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  if (NULL == key)\n  {\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    {\n      if ( (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) &&\n           (NULL == pos->header) )\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    {\n      if ( (0 != (kind & pos->kind)) &&\n           (key_size == pos->header_size) &&\n           ( (key == pos->header) ||\n             (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (key,\n                                             pos->header,\n                                             key_size) ) ) )\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (NULL == pos)\n    return MHD_NO;\n\n  if (NULL != value_ptr)\n    *value_ptr = pos->value;\n\n  if (NULL != value_size_ptr)\n    *value_size_ptr = pos->value_size;\n\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (NULL != value_size_ptr)\n    *value_size_ptr = pos->value_size;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general: the assignment *value_size_ptr = pos->value_size; is guarded by a runtime check (NULL != value_size_ptr) and therefore can affect program behaviour when a caller supplies a non-NULL value_size_ptr. However, it would be a violation if, across the entire project, no caller ever passes a non-NULL value_size_ptr (for example if the only caller is MHD_lookup_connection_value which passes NULL); in that case the assignment would be executed in no execution path and could be considered dead code."
