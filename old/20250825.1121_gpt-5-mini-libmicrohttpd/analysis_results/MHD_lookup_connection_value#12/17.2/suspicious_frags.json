  "explanation": "I examined the provided functions MHD_lookup_connection_value and MHD_lookup_connection_value_n. MHD_lookup_connection_value calls MHD_lookup_connection_value_n, but MHD_lookup_connection_value_n does not call MHD_lookup_connection_value or itself, nor does it invoke any function pointer or callback that could lead to an indirect call back to MHD_lookup_connection_value. The loop bodies contain no function calls that could cause recursion, and the only other function referenced (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_) is not shown to call back into either function. Therefore, there is no evidence in the supplied code of direct or indirect self-calls; no fragments require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 based on the provided code."
