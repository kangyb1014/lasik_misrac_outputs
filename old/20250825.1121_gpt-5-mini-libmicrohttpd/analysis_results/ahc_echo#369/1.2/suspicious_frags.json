  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and related snippets for usage of compiler-specific language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (examples: __attribute__ ((...)), __declspec(...), inline assembler (asm), statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, typeof, nested functions, GCC builtins used as language extensions, Microsoft-specific keywords, etc.). I found none of these explicit extension tokens in the shown code. The code uses only standard C constructs: enums, pointers, casts, struct accesses, standard library functions (strcmp, strlen, memcmp), preprocessor conditionals (#if, #define) and macros. \n\nNotes on items that are not flagged: \n- The identifier _MHD_EXTERN appears in the additional snippet but is a macro name; its expansion is not shown. Without the macro definition showing a compiler-specific extension (for example expanding to __declspec(dllexport) or __attribute__((...))), it cannot be considered an explicit use of a language extension and so is not reported. If the expansion of such macros contains compiler-specific extensions, those expanded forms would need investigation. \n- Leading underscores in identifiers and internal helper names (e.g., MHD_calloc_, MHD_mutex_init_) are naming conventions and not per se compiler extensions. \n- Preprocessor conditionals and macros (SIZEOF_SIZE_T, MHD_USE_THREADS) are standard C preprocessing usage, not language extensions. \n\nIf you can provide the definitions/expansions of any macros such as _MHD_EXTERN or other macros that might expand to compiler-specific keywords, I can re-check and report any explicit compiler extensions found."
