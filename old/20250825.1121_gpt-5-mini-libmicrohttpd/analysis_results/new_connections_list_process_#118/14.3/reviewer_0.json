That function contains a do { ... } while (NULL != local_tail); \u2014 the controlling expression is NULL != local_tail and local_tail is modified by the DLL_remove call inside the loop, so the expression is not invariant and does not violate Rule 14.3.\n\nThe always-true if (1) you refer to comes from the code in new_connection_process_ (the #else /* ! MHD_USE_THREADS */ branch which expands to if (1) { ... }). That if (1) would indeed be an invariant controlling expression in the translation unit when MHD_USE_THREADS is not defined and (if present after preprocessing) would not match the Rule 14.3 exceptions (it is neither an infinite loop nor the permitted do-while(0) pattern). However, that invariant controlling expression is in new_connection_process_, not in new_connections_list_process_, so agent A has misattributed the violation to the wrong function. Therefore the report about new_connections_list_process_ is incorrect."
