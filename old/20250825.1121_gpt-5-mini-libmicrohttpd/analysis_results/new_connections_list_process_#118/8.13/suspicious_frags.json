  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either (a) perform explicit modifications that prevent const-qualification (e.g. assignments to daemon->new_connections_head, daemon->new_connections_tail, daemon->have_new), (b) are assertions or logging macros that do not affect pointer constness semantics (mhd_assert, MHD_DLOG, HAVE_MESSAGES blocks), (c) are control-flow or void casts used solely to suppress compiler warnings ((void) local_head; loop/if/do/while constructs), or (d) involve API calls/macros whose parameters are being used in a mutating way (the code visibly acquires/releases the mutex), so making those pointer types const would be inappropriate. The listed fragments cover all pointer declarations and pointer-valued expressions in the function that should be checked to determine whether a const-qualified pointee type is feasible."
