  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragments. The function and enum use only standard C constructs: static storage, enum constants, standard library call (fprintf), logical-not (!), array indexing, and the standard conditional (?:) operator. The comment style (/* ... */ with Doxygen-like markup) is standard C comment syntax, not a language extension. The initialization of tool_params with integer zeros is standard aggregate initialization. Although the function name contains a double underscore (process_param__epoll), and identifiers with leading underscores or double underscores are reserved by the implementation, that is a portability/reserved-identifier concern from the C standard rather than a compiler language extension; Rule 1.2 concerns compiler-documented language extensions only. Therefore there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
