The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' analysis:\n\n- tool_params (definition and struct/type): The function reads and writes members of this global. MISRA's rule refers to loop control flags (objects with Boolean type used in a loop's second clause) and forbids modifying loop counters or other objects in the loop body. To determine whether accesses/modifications here could be considered loop-control flags or otherwise affect a for loop in this translation unit (or if the same object is used as a loop counter elsewhere), you must know the exact declaration and scope of tool_params.\n\n- type declarations of poll/select/epoll: The MISRA text specifically defines a loop control flag as an object with Boolean type. To decide if any of these members qualify as a loop control flag (and thus whether writes here would violate constraints if a for loop used them), you must know whether these members are of Boolean type or another integer type.\n\n- fprintf and stderr: MISRA requires the second clause to have no persistent side effects and defines that the behaviour of a for-loop body includes behaviour of any functions called within it. If this function (which calls fprintf) were placed inside a for loop or if fprintf-like calls were moved into loop clauses, you must consider their side effects. Knowing the declaration/semantics of fprintf and stderr is therefore necessary to reason about side effects relevant to the rule.\n\n- enum PerfRepl_param_result and constants: These define the function's return values. While they do not directly affect for-loop formation, their definitions are required to fully understand the function's observable behaviour and to confirm that no implicit side-effects relevant to loop semantics are hidden in macros or enum-related constructs.\n\n- param_name parameter type/contract (const char *): The function indexes param_name[1]. To reason about potential undefined behaviour or side effects that could affect compliance with MISRA rules (for example, if param_name access has side-effects via a custom accessor macro), you should confirm its type and usage constraints.\n\nNote: The target function contains no for loop itself. The above symbols are the minimal additional declarations needed to be certain that no hidden interactions (e.g., via globals, side-effecting calls, or mis-typed loop-control flags) would affect a MISRA for-loop well-formedness determination if this function is involved in or moved into loop constructs."
