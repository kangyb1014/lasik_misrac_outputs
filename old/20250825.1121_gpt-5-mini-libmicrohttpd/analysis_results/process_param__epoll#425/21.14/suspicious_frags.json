  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in this function. The only string-related expression is param_name[1] compared to the character '-'; this is a single-character (char) comparison, not a comparison of null-terminated strings via memcmp. The fprintf calls use the %s specifier but do not perform string comparisons. Other statements (flag checks, assignments, ternary return) do not invoke memcmp either. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
