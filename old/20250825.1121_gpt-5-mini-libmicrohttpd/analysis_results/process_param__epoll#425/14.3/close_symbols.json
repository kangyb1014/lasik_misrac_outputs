  "explanation": "- tool_params (definition/type and declaration): The two if conditions test members of this global (tool_params.poll and tool_params.select). To determine whether those controlling expressions can be invariant you must know the variable's declaration, storage class (e.g. static/global), initial value, and whether it can be modified elsewhere (or declared volatile).\n\n- tool_params.poll (field): The expression if (tool_params.poll) is one of the controlling expressions under scrutiny. Knowledge of this field's type (signed/unsigned/integer/boolean), possible constant initialiser, and any constraints on modification is required to decide if the expression can be an invariant.\n\n- tool_params.select (field): Same reasoning as tool_params.poll: the second if uses this field; you must know its definition/type and whether any code can change it.\n\n- tool_params.epoll (field): process_param__epoll assigns to this field (tool_params.epoll = !0). To know whether the earlier tests could be invariant across calls (and whether this assignment affects future behaviour), you need the field's definition and other places that read/write it.\n\n- process_param__poll: This function (and any other code that sets tool_params.poll) is required to determine whether tool_params.poll is ever modified (i.e. that the controlling expression is not a compile-time or run-time invariant).\n\n- process_param__select: Same as above for tool_params.select \u2014 include the routine(s) that modify that field to determine mutability.\n\n- process_short_param: This caller passes param_name for short options. To determine whether the ternary controlling expression ('-' == param_name[1]) is invariant you must inspect how param_name is constructed/passed for short options (e.g. pointers into argv, single-character option strings).\n\n- process_long_param: Same as process_short_param but for long-option callers; it is needed to see what form of string is passed as param_name for long options and whether param_name[1] is fixed.\n\nNotes: The MISRA rule applies to each controlling expression in this function: if (tool_params.poll), if (tool_params.select) and the ternary '-' == param_name[1]. The listed symbols are the minimal additional program elements required to determine whether those expressions can be invariant (e.g. constants, never-modified globals, or always the same string). Other symbols like error/result constants or fprintf/stderr are irrelevant to the invariance analysis and were omitted for conciseness."
