  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code was found in the function. The two return statements are inside conditional blocks (if (tool_params.poll) and if (tool_params.select)) and are therefore reachable when those runtime conditions are true. The assignment tool_params.epoll = ! 0 and the final return statement are reachable when both conditions are false. The ternary expression in the final return has both outcomes reachable depending on the runtime value of param_name[1]. There are no unconditional returns, gotos, infinite loops, or constant conditions that would make any subsequent statement unreachable at compile time. (Potential runtime issues such as dereferencing param_name when it is NULL are not related to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 and thus are not flagged here.)"
