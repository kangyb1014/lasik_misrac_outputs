  "explanation": "No other pointer declarations or pointer parameters appear in the provided code; the struct Sha256Ctx contains only array and scalar members (uint32_t arrays and a uint64_t), not pointer members. The body contains direct assignments to ctx->H[...] and ctx->count, indicating the function modifies the context object; therefore there are no additional pointer usages in this fragment that could be const-qualified. Other parts of the code do not present pointer-to-non-const occurrences to be investigated for Rule 8.13."
