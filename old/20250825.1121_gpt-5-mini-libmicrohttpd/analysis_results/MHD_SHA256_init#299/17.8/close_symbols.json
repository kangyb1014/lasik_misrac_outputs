  "explanation": "1) struct Sha256Ctx (full definition): Needed to confirm that ctx is a pointer to a structure and to inspect the members H and count. The MISRA rule permits modification of the object pointed to (members of *ctx) but forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself. Knowing whether H and count are structure members (and their types) shows that the statements ctx->H[...] = ... and ctx->count = 0 modify the pointee, not the parameter variable ctx. Also the struct definition rules out any unusual macro-based member access that might alter the pointer.\n\n2) UINT32_C macro definition: This macro is used in each assignment. While typically it only produces an integer constant, a local project redefinition could conceivably expand to something with side effects or an assignment. Inspecting its definition verifies it cannot modify the parameter variable (ctx) or perform hidden assignments to it.\n\n3) Relevant stdint typedefs (e.g. uint32_t): These are needed to understand the types produced by UINT32_C and by the H member (e.g. array of uint32_t). This confirms the expressions are simple constant-to-member assignments (pointee modification) rather than any construct that might rebind or assign to the pointer parameter itself."
