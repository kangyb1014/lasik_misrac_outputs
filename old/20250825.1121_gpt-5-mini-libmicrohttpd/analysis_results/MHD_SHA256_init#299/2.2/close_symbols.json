  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to determine whether MHD_SHA256_init is dead code:\n\n- digest_init_one_time\n  Reason: It is a direct caller of MHD_SHA256_init per the static call graph. You must inspect this function to determine under what conditions it calls MHD_SHA256_init (always, conditionally, or never) and whether digest_init_one_time itself is reachable.\n\n- digest_reset\n  Reason: Also a direct caller. Same as above: analyze its call conditions and reachability to decide if MHD_SHA256_init can ever be executed via this path.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest\n  Reason: It is a caller of digest_init_one_time in the call graph. To prove MHD_SHA256_init is reachable you must trace from higher-level callers down to the init function; if this caller (or others) is never invoked at runtime, the init may be dead.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash\n  Reason: Another higher-level caller of digest_init_one_time; needed to establish runtime reachability of the chain that leads to MHD_SHA256_init.\n\n- digest_auth_check_all_inner\n  Reason: It calls both digest_init_one_time and digest_reset. Its reachability and call conditions determine whether either caller (and thus MHD_SHA256_init) is executed at runtime.\n\n- queue_auth_required_response3_inner\n  Reason: It calls digest_init_one_time. As a likely request/response handler, it may be an important program entry point; inspect it to see if it is invoked in normal operation.\n\n- calculate_add_nonce_with_retry\n  Reason: It calls digest_reset. Its execution path (and whether it calls digest_reset in practice) matters to decide if the reset\u2192init chain is reachable.\n\n- MHD_MD5_init and MHD_SHA512_256_init\n  Reason: These are sibling initializers invoked by digest_init_one_time/digest_reset. Include them to (a) check for possible indirect calls back into MHD_SHA256_init (cycles), and (b) compare side effects: if other initializers are used but SHA\u2011256 init is not, that helps determine whether the SHA256 init is redundant.\n\n- struct Sha256Ctx (type definition)\n  Reason: The function operates on struct Sha256Ctx members (H[] and count). To decide whether the writes performed by MHD_SHA256_init are semantically meaningful (i.e. have observable effect) you must know the layout, whether members are volatile, and whether initialization is required by other code.\n\n- all functions that read or overwrite Sha256Ctx->H or Sha256Ctx->count (i.e. SHA\u2011256 consumers)\n  Reason: Even if MHD_SHA256_init is called, its assignments are only meaningful if later code reads those members (or relies on their initialized values). You must inspect every consumer (update/transform/finish functions, or any code that reinitializes/overwrites the struct) to decide whether the assignments are necessary or redundant (dead).\n\n- UINT32_C macro / stdint constants\n  Reason: To confirm the constants used are compile-time constants and that the writes are not performing observable runtime work beyond simple assignment. This is minor but helps rule out side effects from the constants or macro usage.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let you trace reachability from program entry points to MHD_SHA256_init, detect any conditional paths that prevent invocation, detect cycles or indirect calls, and determine whether the assignments made by the function produce observable effects later (so they are not dead)."
