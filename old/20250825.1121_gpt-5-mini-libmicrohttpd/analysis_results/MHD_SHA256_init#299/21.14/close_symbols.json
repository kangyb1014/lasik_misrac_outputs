  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_SHA256_init violates the MISRA rule (no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) we need the following symbols and why:\n\n- UINT32_C: This macro is used in the function body. Ensure it is a simple integer constant macro and not implemented as or expanded to a function or expression that could call memcmp (very unlikely but must be ruled out).\n\n- struct Sha256Ctx: The full definition is needed to confirm that assignments in MHD_SHA256_init are plain constant stores and do not invoke any overloaded operator/function-like macros or inline functions that could call memcmp.\n\n- Sha256Ctx::H: The array member being assigned; check its element type and whether assignment semantics are direct stores (no hidden function calls that might use memcmp).\n\n- Sha256Ctx::count: The field being set to 0; verify type and that the write is a plain store.\n\n- memcmp: The symbol itself must be considered to check whether it is used anywhere impacting this function (directly or via macros). Also needed to check for project-specific redefinitions or macro wrappers that map to memcmp.\n\n- any project wrapper macros or functions that expand/alias to memcmp (e.g. MHD_memcmp if present): Some codebases wrap standard functions; ensure no macro used in this file expands into memcmp usage affecting the init function.\n\n- digest_init_one_time and digest_reset: These are callers of MHD_SHA256_init in the static call graph. Include them to verify there is no inlining, macro trickery, or compilation-unit level constructs that would merge code (or cause memcmp usage to be considered part of initialization). Also to confirm that no indirect usage of memcmp is introduced when initialization is orchestrated.\n\n- MHD_MD5_init and MHD_SHA512_256_init: These sibling init functions are called by the same callers as MHD_SHA256_init. Inspecting them helps rule out project-wide init macros/constructs that might hide memcmp usage affecting how initializers are implemented or invoked.\n\nIn short: inspect the macro UINT32_C and the concrete structure/fields used by MHD_SHA256_init to ensure the function contains only direct constant stores; and scan for memcmp (and any wrappers) in the same translation unit and in caller/callee functions to ensure there is no hidden or inlined use of memcmp related to initialization. If the above symbols show only direct stores and no memcmp (or wrappers) usage, MHD_SHA256_init does not violate the MISRA rule."
