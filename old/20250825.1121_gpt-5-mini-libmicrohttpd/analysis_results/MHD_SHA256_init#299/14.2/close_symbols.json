Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_SHA256_init could violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule we must be sure there are no hidden for-loops or side-effects in the function body or in anything the body expands to. The required symbols are:\n\n- struct Sha256Ctx (full definition): The function assigns into ctx->H[...] and ctx->count. The struct definition is needed to confirm these are plain data members and not implemented in a way that could invoke side effects (for example, via macros, function-like accessors, or unusual types). It also reveals whether the struct or its members are volatile or have other qualifiers that change semantics.\n\n- Sha256Ctx::H (declaration: type, dimensions, qualifiers): Specifically know H's element type (e.g., uint32_t), its array size and any qualifiers. If H or its elements are of a type that has assignment side effects (volatile, atomic, or mapped to accessor macros), that could imply hidden behaviour executed in the function body (which would matter for the MISRA rule about modifications inside loop bodies and side-effects in loop clauses).\n\n- Sha256Ctx::count (declaration: type, qualifiers): Confirm the type and qualifiers of count. If count is volatile, an accessor, or its assignment triggers side effects, that may affect whether loop clauses use objects modified in the body or whether side effects exist.\n\n- UINT32_C (macro definition): The constants are written using UINT32_C(...). We must inspect the macro expansion to ensure it is a simple integer-constant/type-cast macro and does not expand to code with side-effects or control flow (e.g., function calls, loops). Any such expansion could introduce behaviour relevant to MISRA loop rules when used inside loops.\n\n- uint32_t (typedef / underlying type used by UINT32_C): Knowing the underlying integer type and any platform-specific qualifiers ensures that assignments are simple scalar stores and not mapped to complex types that could have side effects.\n\n- Any preprocessor macros that rename/expand identifiers used in the function (MHD_SHA256_init, ctx, H, count): A macro could redefine or hide identifiers (for example, making ctx expand to an expression with side effects). Checking for such macros guarantees the apparent simple assignments are actually simple and contain no hidden loops or side-effects.\n\nNo callees are invoked by MHD_SHA256_init, so no other function definitions are required. Once the above symbols are inspected and shown to be simple data types/macros without hidden control-flow or side-effects, you can conclude that MHD_SHA256_init does not contain or invoke any for-loops and thus cannot violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule."
