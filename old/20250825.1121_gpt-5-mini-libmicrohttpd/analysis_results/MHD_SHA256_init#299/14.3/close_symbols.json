  "explanation": "struct Sha256Ctx: You must see the complete type/definition to know the exact member names, types and qualifiers (e.g. whether members are volatile, macros that expand to control-flow, or indexed through accessor macros). If the structure definition contained macros or inline functions that introduce control-flow, that could create a controlling expression inside MHD_SHA256_init.\n\nSha256Ctx::H: The function assigns to H[0]..H[7]. You need the declaration of H (element type, array length and any qualifiers) to verify that these are plain integer stores and to rule out any hidden control expressions (e.g. if H is a property accessor macro or a type with overloaded/side-effecting assignment via macros). Also confirms the indexing is within bounds (H length >= 8) though bounds is a different rule.\n\nSha256Ctx::count: The function sets ctx->count = 0; you need the exact type and qualifiers of count (signed/unsigned width, volatile, or if count is a macro/inline accessor) to ensure that the assignment or any underlying expansion doesn't contain a controlling expression or hidden loop/branch.\n\nUINT32_C: This macro supplies the constants used for H[]. You must inspect its definition to confirm it is a simple integer constant expression (as expected from <stdint.h>) and not a macro that expands to code containing control-flow or invariant-controlling expressions.\n\nuint32_t: The macro UINT32_C expands to a literal of type uint32_t; knowing the precise integer type semantics (width, signedness) assures these are compile-time constants and not expressions that could introduce control-flow. This helps demonstrate there are no loop/conditional controlling expressions inside the function.\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule in question concerns invariant controlling expressions (loops/conditionals). MHD_SHA256_init contains no explicit loops or conditionals; to be certain the function does not obtain control-flow via macro expansions or via structure member accessors, the above symbols (structure and the macro used for constants and the integer type) must be checked. No caller symbols are required because callers cannot change whether this function contains an invariant controlling expression unless the function body is modified by macros/types listed above."
