  "explanation": "- struct Sha256Ctx (full definition): Needed to determine the actual layout and sizes of members, to check that ctx->H and ctx->count reference valid storage and to ensure the H array has at least 8 elements. The MISRA rule concerns out-of-bounds accesses; the struct definition is primary evidence.\n- definition of H member (element type and array length): Although part of the struct, call out the H member specifically so the analyzer can verify the assignment to H[0]..H[7] is within bounds and that the element type matches the assigned constants.\n- definition/type of count member: Required to confirm that ctx->count = 0 writes to a suitably sized object and does not involve any hidden manipulation (bitfields, padding, or macros) that could invoke string.h functions or out-of-bounds behavior.\n- UINT32_C macro definition: To confirm it expands to a plain integer constant (from <stdint.h>) and does not hide any function-like behavior that could call string.h routines or perform unexpected memory operations.\n- uint32_t (and related stdint types) typedefs/widths on the target platform: To ensure the assigned constants fit the target type and to rule out any platform-specific typedefs that might be macros or wrappers with side effects.\n- full definitions (source or prototypes) of callers: digest_init_one_time and digest_reset: The target function is called by these functions; to prove no string.h functions are invoked indirectly (for example, by passing an invalid pointer or by callers performing prior memory operations), the callers\u2019 code and how they obtain/pass the ctx pointer must be inspected.\n- any structures/variables that the callers use/derive when they obtain the Sha256Ctx pointer passed to MHD_SHA256_init: If the callers pass a pointer into a larger object, or into a buffer/stack area, we must inspect those container definitions and allocation sites to ensure the pointer actually references a full Sha256Ctx (so ctx->H[0..7] and ctx->count accesses are in-bounds) and that no string.h calls modify the memory in a way that could cause out-of-bounds access.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst verify (a) that MHD_SHA256_init itself contains no calls to string.h functions, (b) that the writes it performs are within the bounds of the referenced object, and (c) that callers do not pass invalid or undersized pointers or perform intervening string.h operations that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses."
