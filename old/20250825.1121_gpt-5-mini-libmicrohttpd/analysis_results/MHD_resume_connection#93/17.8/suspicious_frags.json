  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies the parameter variable 'connection' itself. The only operations involving the parameter are: reading connection->daemon into a local pointer (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;), and modifying members of the object pointed to by the parameter (connection->resuming = true;). MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter; it only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself (e.g., assigning to 'connection'). There are no assignments to 'connection' in the function. Other uses (mhd_assert, MHD_PANIC, mutex calls, MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_DLOG) do not assign to the parameter variable either. Therefore no fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
