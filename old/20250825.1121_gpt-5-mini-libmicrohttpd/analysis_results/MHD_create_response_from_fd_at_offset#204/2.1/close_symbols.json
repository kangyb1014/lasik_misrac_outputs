  "explanation": "Why each is required to decide if there is unreachable code\n\n1) MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64\n   - You must inspect the callee's prototype/definition to know whether the call is actually reachable (e.g. if it is a macro that expands differently, is inlined away, or carries attributes that affect control flow). If the callee were marked noreturn (or its body unconditionally does not return), that could make code after the call unreachable in other contexts; conversely its behavior may affect whether the casted offset path is meaningful.\n\n2) off_t (typedef / definition)\n   - The if (0 > offset) test depends on the signedness and range of off_t. To determine whether the negative-branch (return NULL) can ever be taken you need to know the exact type definition of off_t on the target platform (signedness, width, any typedefs/macro aliases).\n\n3) uint64_t (typedef)\n   - The function casts offset to uint64_t before calling the 64-bit API. Understanding the cast semantics (and actual width of uint64_t on the platform) is required to reason whether some values (e.g. negative off_t) become large positive integers and whether that affects reachability/meaning of the call.\n\n4) _MHD_EXTERN / MHD_EXTERN macro\n   - This linkage/attribute macro can expand to compiler attributes (visibility, calling convention, or even noreturn in unusual cases). You must examine its definition to rule out attributes that affect reachability or control flow analysis.\n\n5) struct MHD_Response (definition)\n   - The function returns a pointer to this type (or NULL). Knowing its definition is useful to confirm there are no hidden semantic constraints (e.g. special return requirements) that could indicate dead code or force different control-flow reasoning in the surrounding API usage.\n\n6) Callers of MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset (whole-program call sites / symbol-table references)\n   - To prove whether any branch inside this function is unreachable you must know whether the function itself is ever invoked and with what argument ranges. A function that is never called makes its entire body unreachable in the final program; conversely if it is called only with non-negative offsets the negative-branch may be unreachable. Thus you need the program-wide callers (or the link-time symbol reference list) that pass offset values.\n\n7) Definition/prototype attributes for MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64 (e.g. __attribute__((noreturn)), inline)\n   - Separate from the callee body, the prototype/attributes can change control-flow assumptions (noreturn makes code after a call unreachable; inline/static may alter visibility for reachability analysis). These attributes must be checked to correctly determine reachable vs unreachable code.\n\n(Collecting the above symbols/definitions and inspecting the program-wide call sites/symbol table is sufficient to decide whether either branch in this function \u2014 the negative-offset return or the call path \u2014 is provably unreachable under the MISRA rule.)"
