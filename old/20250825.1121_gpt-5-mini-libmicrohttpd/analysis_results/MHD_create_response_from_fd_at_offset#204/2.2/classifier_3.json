  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset (size_t size,\n                                       int fd,\n                                       off_t offset)\n{\n  if (0 > offset)\n    return NULL;\n  return MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64 (size,\n                                                  fd,\n                                                  (uint64_t) offset);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset (size_t size,\n                                       int fd,\n                                       off_t offset)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The provided fragment is only the function signature (no executed statements). By itself this does not constitute dead code and cannot demonstrate a Rule 2.2 violation. A concrete violation would require an executed operation whose removal does not affect program behaviour \u2014 for example, if the (not shown) function body only forwarded to MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64 with no side effects and every call could be replaced by a direct call to the 64\u2011bit function without changing behaviour, then the wrapper\u2019s executed operations would be dead code."
