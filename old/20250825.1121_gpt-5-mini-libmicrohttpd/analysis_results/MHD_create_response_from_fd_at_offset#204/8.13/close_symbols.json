  "explanation": "1) MHD_create_response_from_fd_at_offset64: the target simply forwards to this function and returns its result. To determine whether any pointer should be const-qualified (MISRA rule), you must see the callee's prototype/declaration to know the exact return type (e.g. struct MHD_Response * vs const struct MHD_Response *) and parameter types that might involve pointers.\n\n2) struct MHD_Response: the return type is a pointer to this structure. Knowing the full type/definition (or at least whether the API intends immutable response objects) is necessary to decide whether the returned pointer should be to a const-qualified target.\n\n3) uint64_t: the target casts offset to uint64_t. The exact typedef is needed to ensure the cast does not hide pointer/const issues and to confirm no pointer types are involved in the conversion.\n\n4) off_t: the function parameter type; its definition/typedef is required to check whether it could be or contain pointer types or const qualifiers that affect the const-pointer rule (and to verify the cast semantics).\n\n5) size_t: the size parameter type is used in the forwarded call; its typedef is needed to fully understand signatures and to detect any pointer-related or const-qualified typedefs in the chain.\n\n(These symbols provide the minimal type and prototype information required to decide if any pointer in the target's signature/return should be const-qualified. Other callers/callees in the call graph are not necessary unless the callee's declaration references them.)"
