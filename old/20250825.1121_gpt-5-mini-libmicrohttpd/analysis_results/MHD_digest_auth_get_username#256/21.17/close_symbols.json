  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C string-bounds analysis:\n\n- get_rq_uname\n  Reason: This function writes the username into the buffer (username, buf_size) and returns the number of bytes used. To determine whether any string.h calls (e.g. memcpy/memmove/strlen inside it) may write beyond the provided buffer you must inspect its implementation and contract (maximum bytes written, null-termination behavior, and any internal uses of memcpy/str*).\n\n- get_rq_unames_size\n  Reason: Supplies buf_size used for allocation and passed to get_rq_uname. You must verify that the returned size is sufficient for the worst-case number of bytes get_rq_uname will write (and that no off-by-one/overflow occurs when used for allocation).\n\n- get_rq_uname_type\n  Reason: The code branches on the username type; get_rq_uname behavior and required buffer layout may differ by type. Knowing how the type is determined affects which code paths and string operations in get_rq_uname are exercised.\n\n- struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo\n  Reason: The automatic uname_strct is memset()'ed and later inspected (uname_strct.uname_type). Its fields (their sizes and meanings) influence how get_rq_uname populates it and whether memset(sizeof(uname_strct)) is correct; also fields may determine lengths used when copying into the output buffer.\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuth\n  Reason: The params pointer content drives get_rq_unames_size, get_rq_uname_type, and get_rq_uname. The layout and semantic meaning of its fields (lengths, pointers to header fragments, encoding flags) are needed to reason about sizes and whether downstream string operations can overrun buffers.\n\n- enum MHD_DigestAuthUsernameType\n  Reason: The code accepts only STANDARD or EXTENDED; explicit integer values and any additional enum variants or aliasing could affect control flow and whether extended-encoding-specific copy routines (with different size rules) are used.\n\n- MHD_calloc_\n  Reason: Allocation function used to obtain username buffer. Need its semantics: does it allocate exactly (count * size) bytes, does it zero memory, and does it detect/handle multiplication overflow. If MHD_calloc_ can allocate fewer bytes than requested or overflow, buffer writes can exceed allocation.\n\n- free\n  Reason: Standard deallocation; included for completeness to review correct ownership/cleanup. (Not directly a string.h issue but relevant to lifetime checks if static analysis tracks freed memory.)\n\n- memset\n  Reason: The target calls memset(&uname_strct, 0, sizeof(uname_strct)); MISRA checks require ensuring the size argument matches the object size and that memset will not write beyond the object. The actual definition/semantics are standard but you must verify sizeof(uname_strct) is correct given the struct definition.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  Reason: The code uses mhd_assert(buf_size != 0). You must inspect its definition because assertions may be compiled out. If the assert is the only check preventing zero or invalid sizes, its absence in non-debug builds could change whether a string-lib operation is safe.\n\n- MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_\n  Reason: Provides the params pointer. You need to verify it returns a valid, fully populated MHD_RqDAuth structure derived from request input; malformed or truncated params could lead to size mismatches and out-of-bounds access during subsequent string operations.\n\n- get_rq_param_unquoted_copy_z\n  Reason: Called (indirectly) by get_rq_uname per the call graph; likely performs copying/unquoting using string functions. Its implementation and copy limits must be reviewed for potential memcpy/strcpy/strlen misuse or off-by-one writes.\n\n- get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z\n  Reason: Called for extended username encoding paths; may perform different decoding that writes to the output buffer (username). You must inspect its bounds checking and any internal string.h calls to ensure it does not exceed the provided buf_size.\n\n- MHD_hex_to_bin\n  Reason: Called by get_rq_uname (per call graph) to convert hex sequences into binary; its implementation may write variable amounts into the destination buffer and must be verified to honor the provided destination size and not use unsafe string.h calls that can overrun.\n\nIn summary: to decide if any string.h call can access beyond object bounds you must inspect the implementations/contracts of get_rq_uname and get_rq_unames_size (and the helper functions they call), the structure definitions (so that sizeof and field-driven lengths are correct), the allocator semantics (MHD_calloc_), and the assert implementation (mhd_assert) because runtime and compile-time behaviors affect whether the bounds checks that prevent overruns are present."
