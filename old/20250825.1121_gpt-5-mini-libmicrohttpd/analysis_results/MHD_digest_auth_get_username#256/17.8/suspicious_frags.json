  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided functions: MHD_digest_auth_get_username, MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_, get_rq_uname_type, get_rq_unames_size, and get_rq_uname. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying a function parameter (the pointer variable itself); modifying the object pointed to is allowed. In the shown code: - No function reassigns any of its parameter variables (there are no statements like \"connection = ...\", \"params = ...\", \"uname_info = ...\", \"buf = ...\", or similar). - The code does modify members of objects reached via pointer parameters (e.g., connection->rq.dauth_tried, connection->rq.dauth, and fields of *uname_info) and writes into buffers pointed to by pointer parameters; these are permitted by the rule because the pointer itself is not reassigned. - Local variables (e.g., params in MHD_digest_auth_get_username) are assigned, but they are not function parameters. - Macros and casts (MHD_calloc_, casts to char*/uint8_t*) do not reassign parameter variables. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that appear to violate Rule 17.8; no further investigation of parameter reassignment is necessary for these fragments."
