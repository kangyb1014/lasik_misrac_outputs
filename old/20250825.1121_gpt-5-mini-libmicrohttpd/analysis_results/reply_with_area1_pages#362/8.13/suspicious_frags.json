  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const where appropriate or clearly require mutable pointers:\n\n- The page data is declared as static const char page_content[] and its length as static const size_t page_content_len \u2014 these already satisfy the intent of Rule 8.13.\n- The function parameter const char *url is already const-qualified and therefore not a concern.\n- The explicitly disabled code (#if 0 ... #endif) is inactive and need not be inspected here.\n- Calls that destroy or queue responses (e.g. MHD_destroy_response(resp) and the expected use of MHD_queue_response) operate on objects that are typically modified by the API; those pointers are expected to be non-const and therefore are not candidates for conversion to pointers-to-const without checking the external API semantics.\n\nThe selected fragments should be investigated because they involve pointers/arguments whose const-qualification may be unclear from this local code (pointer parameter to the function, local response pointer, and calls that pass a const buffer or string literal to external API functions)."
