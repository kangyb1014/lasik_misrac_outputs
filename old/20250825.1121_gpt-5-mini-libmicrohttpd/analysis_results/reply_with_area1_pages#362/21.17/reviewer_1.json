The string literal operand is safe (compile\u2011time NUL terminated), but there is no evident guarantee in the shown code that url is NUL\u2011terminated, so strcmp may access beyond the bounds and thus violates Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function reply_with_area1_pages:\n#define SEC_AREA1_URL \"/secret_page/\"\n...\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nhandle_sec_areas_req (struct MHD_Connection *c, const char *url, unsigned int\n                      sec_area_num)\n{\n  struct MHD_DigestAuthUsernameInfo *username_info;\n  struct UserEntry *user_entry;\n  void *userdigest;\n  size_t userdigest_size;\n  enum MHD_DigestAuthResult auth_res;\n\n  username_info = MHD_digest_auth_get_username3 (c);\n\n  if (NULL == username_info)\n    return reply_with_auth_required (c, 0, 0);\n\n  user_entry = find_entry_by_userinfo (username_info);\n\n  if (NULL == user_entry)\n    return reply_with_auth_required (c, 0, 1);\n\n  switch (username_info->algo3)\n  {\n  case MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_MD5:\n    userdigest = user_entry->userdigest_md5;\n    userdigest_size = sizeof(user_entry->userdigest_md5);\n    break;\n  case MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA256:\n    userdigest = user_entry->userdigest_sha256;\n    userdigest_size = sizeof(user_entry->userdigest_sha256);\n    break;\n  case MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA512_256:\n    userdigest = user_entry->userdigest_sha512_256;\n    userdigest_size = sizeof(user_entry->userdigest_sha512_256);\n    break;\n  case MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_MD5_SESSION:\n  case MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA256_SESSION:\n  case MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA512_256_SESSION:\n    /* Not supported currently and not used by MHD.\n       The client incorrectly used algorithm not advertised by the server. */\n    return reply_with_auth_required (c, 0, 1);\n  case MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_INVALID: /* Mute compiler warning */\n  default:\n    return MHD_NO; /* Should be unreachable */\n  }\n\n  auth_res = MHD_digest_auth_check_digest3 (\n    c,\n    REALM, /* Make sure to use the proper realm, not the realm provided by the client and returned by \"user_entry\" */\n    user_entry->username,\n    userdigest,\n    userdigest_size,\n    0, /* Use daemon's default value for nonce_timeout*/\n    0, /* Use daemon's default value for max_nc */\n    get_m_QOP (),\n    (enum MHD_DigestAuthMultiAlgo3) username_info->algo3 /* Direct cast from \"single algorithm\" to \"multi-algorithm\" is allowed */\n    );\n\n  if (MHD_DAUTH_OK != auth_res)\n  {\n    int need_just_refresh_nonce;\n    /* Actually MHD_DAUTH_NONCE_OTHER_COND should not be returned as\n       MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_NONCE_BIND_TYPE is not used for the daemon.\n       To keep the code universal the MHD_DAUTH_NONCE_OTHER_COND is\n       still checked here. */\n    need_just_refresh_nonce =\n      (MHD_DAUTH_NONCE_STALE == auth_res)\n      || (MHD_DAUTH_NONCE_OTHER_COND == auth_res);\n    return reply_with_auth_required (c,\n                                     need_just_refresh_nonce,\n                                     ! need_just_refresh_nonce);\n  }\n\n  /* The user successfully authenticated */\n\n  /* Check whether access to the request area is allowed for the user */\n  if (1 == sec_area_num)\n  {\n    if (user_entry->allow_area_1)\n      return reply_with_area1_pages (c, url);\n    else\n      return reply_with_forbidden (c);\n  }\n  else if (2 == sec_area_num)\n  {\n    if (user_entry->allow_area_2)\n      return reply_with_area2_pages (c, url);\n    else\n      return reply_with_forbidden (c);\n  }\n\n  return MHD_NO; /* Should be unreachable */\n}\n</additional code>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct in the scenario as presented. strcmp scans the memory pointed to by its pointer arguments until it finds a NUL byte. In the shown code there is no local check or visible contract in the snippet that guarantees the incoming url pointer refers to a NUL\u2011terminated character array. If url were not NUL\u2011terminated (e.g. a length/ buffer pair or a truncated/nonterminated buffer), strcmp(url, ...) could read past the bounds of the url object and thus would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n\nNote: this is a potential/use-site violation \u2014 it only actually violates the rule if the caller of reply_with_area1_pages (or the library that provides url) does not guarantee NUL termination. If the surrounding framework / API (the MHD library) documents and enforces that url is always a properly NUL\u2011terminated C string, then the use of strcmp is acceptable. To be MISRA\u2011safe in absence of an explicit documented guarantee, the code should either validate/ensure NUL termination before calling strcmp, or use a bounded comparison approach (e.g. compare up to a known length of the literal with strncmp/memcmp using the literal length), or otherwise rely on a verified API contract."
