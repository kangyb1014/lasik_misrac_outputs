  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard C constructs: static function scope, standard types (size_t, bool), pointer/struct member access, ordinary conditional and return statements, (void) cast to silence an unused-parameter warning, and preprocessor conditional compilation (#ifdef/#endif). There are no uses of known vendor/compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __declspec, __builtin_..., __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, asm goto, or other documented compiler-specific keywords. The identifiers and macros seen (e.g. MHD_... names and the _(...) translation macro) are ordinary identifiers or project macros, not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
