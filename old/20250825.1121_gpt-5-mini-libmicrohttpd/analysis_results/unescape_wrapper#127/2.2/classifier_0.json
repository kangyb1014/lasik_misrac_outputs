  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of unescape_wrapper:\n```c\nstatic size_t\nunescape_wrapper (void *cls,\n                  struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  char *val)\n{\n  bool broken;\n  size_t res;\n  (void) cls; /* Mute compiler warning. */\n\n  /* TODO: add individual parameter */\n  if (0 <= connection->daemon->client_discipline)\n    return MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_strict_ (val);\n\n  res = MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_ (val, &broken);\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (broken)\n  {\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"The URL encoding is broken.\\n\"));\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n  return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function unescape_wrapper:\nenum MHD_AuthType type\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (broken)\n  {\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"The URL encoding is broken.\\n\"));\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the conditional logging block is only compiled when HAVE_MESSAGES is defined, and when executed (broken true) it performs logging (affects observable behaviour such as output/timing). Therefore it is not dead code. (Note: it would be a violation if the logging macro MHD_DLOG expanded to a no\u2011op or if the block could never be compiled/executed in the project configuration, in which case the operations would be removable without changing behaviour.)"
