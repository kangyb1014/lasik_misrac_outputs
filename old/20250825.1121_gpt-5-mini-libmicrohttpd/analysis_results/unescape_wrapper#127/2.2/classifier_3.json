The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of unescape_wrapper:\n```c\nstatic size_t\nunescape_wrapper (void *cls,\n                  struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                  char *val)\n{\n  bool broken;\n  size_t res;\n  (void) cls; /* Mute compiler warning. */\n\n  /* TODO: add individual parameter */\n  if (0 <= connection->daemon->client_discipline)\n    return MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_strict_ (val);\n\n  res = MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_ (val, &broken);\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (broken)\n  {\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"The URL encoding is broken.\\n\"));\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_MESSAGES */\n  return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function unescape_wrapper:\nenum MHD_AuthType type\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n(void) cls; /* Mute compiler warning. */\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
