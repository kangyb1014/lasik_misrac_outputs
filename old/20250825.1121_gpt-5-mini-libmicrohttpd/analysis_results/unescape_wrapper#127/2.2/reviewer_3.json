  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The cast-to-void expression (void) cls; is an expression statement that is executed but has no effect on program behaviour; removing it would not change the function's semantics. That matches the rule's definition of dead code, so the agent's characterization is correct. (Practically this idiom is commonly used to suppress compiler warnings and is often accepted by projects via an explicit deviation or a dedicated annotation, but strictly speaking under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 the statement is dead code.)"
