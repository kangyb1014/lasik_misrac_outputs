  "explanation": "The only pointer objects in this function that may be eligible for const-qualification and therefore warrant investigation are the unused/opaque context pointer (cls) and the connection pointer (and accesses to connection->daemon). The parameter val is passed to in-place decode functions that modify the buffer, so it must remain a pointer to non-const and does not need investigation. Local scalar variables (res, broken) and non-pointer expressions (return statements, preprocessor blocks) are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and therefore need not be inspected."
