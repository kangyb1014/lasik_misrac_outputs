  "scenario": "From the fragment alone it cannot be determined whether Rule 8.13 is violated. The expression accesses connection->daemon->client_discipline but the declaration of the pointer member 'daemon' is not shown. If 'daemon' is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;') and the code only reads from it, then Rule 8.13 would be violated because the pointer could (and should) point to a const-qualified type (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon;'). Conversely, if 'daemon' is already declared with a const-qualified target or the pointee must be modified elsewhere, there is no violation."
