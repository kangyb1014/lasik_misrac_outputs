  "explanation": "I inspected unescape_wrapper and the related functions. Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the parameter variable itself (reassigning the pointer), but allows modifying the object pointed to. In the provided code there are no assignments to the parameter variables (no statements like \"cls = ...\", \"connection = ...\", \"val = ...\" or \"str = ...\"). The only use of cls is (void) cls to silence a warning. unescape_wrapper passes val to decoder functions, which modify the pointed-to buffer (str[w] = 0, str[...] = ... ) and set *broken_encoding \u2014 these modify the pointees, which is permitted. No function reassigns pointer parameters or non-pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate or need investigation for Rule 17.8."
