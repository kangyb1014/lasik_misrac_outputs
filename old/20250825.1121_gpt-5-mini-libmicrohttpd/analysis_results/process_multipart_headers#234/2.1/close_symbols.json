  "explanation": "For a sound determination whether any branch or statement in process_multipart_headers is unreachable you must know the types, invariants and behaviors that affect control flow and loop termination:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: The function reads and writes multiple fields (buffer_pos, buffer_size, state, skip_rn, content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding) and uses pointer arithmetic (char *buf = (char *)&pp[1]) that depends on the struct layout or flexible-array/adjacent allocation. The struct definition and any trailing buffer layout are required to know which indexes/values are possible and whether accesses/assignments are meaningful or inherently impossible.\n\n- enum PP_State (PP_Error etc.): The code assigns pp->state = PP_Error and pp->state = next_state; knowing the enum values and possible next_state domain is necessary to see whether assignments or subsequent states can make code unreachable (or whether some state values are impossible).\n\n- RN_* (RN_Full, RN_OptN): pp->skip_rn is set to RN_Full or RN_OptN; the type and constants are needed to understand whether those assignments could have implications for later control flow or invariants the analysis must respect.\n\n- MHD_YES / MHD_NO: The function returns these macros. Their definitions (values and any special semantics) are needed to understand the function exit behavior for reachability analysis.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (prototype and semantics): This call controls the main if/else branch that leads to different call sequences (try_get_value vs try_match_header). You need its prototype and matching semantics (when it can return true/false, whether it can longjmp/abort) to decide whether either branch is potentially taken or one branch is impossible (i.e., unreachable).\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (macro): Used to compute offsets passed into try_get_value; you need its expansion/value to reason about the pointer arithmetic/indices and whether the calls are well-formed or dead (e.g., offset beyond buffer length making branch impossible).\n\n- try_get_value (prototype, return type, side-effects): Called in the Content-disposition branch. You must know whether it can affect control flow (return, longjmp, abort) or has preconditions that make that branch impossible; its side-effects (setting pp->content_name/filename) are less relevant to reachability but its control-flow behavior is required.\n\n- try_match_header (prototype, return type, side-effects): Called in the else branch; same rationale as try_get_value \u2014 its behavior could affect whether that branch is reachable or terminates unexpectedly.\n\n- post_process_multipart: This caller/producer sets up the MHD_PostProcessor buffer contents, buffer_pos and buffer_size and likely enforces invariants (e.g., buffer_pos <= buffer_size, how pp is allocated and how &pp[1] is used). To determine whether conditions such as (newline == pp->buffer_size) or (newline == pp->buffer_pos) or (0 == newline) are possible or impossible (and thus whether subsequent code is unreachable), you need the code/contract in post_process_multipart (or other producers) that initialize and maintain those fields.\n\nTogether these symbols provide the necessary type/layout information, the producer-side invariants for buffer_pos/buffer_size and the callee behaviors that determine which branches and returns are actually reachable."
