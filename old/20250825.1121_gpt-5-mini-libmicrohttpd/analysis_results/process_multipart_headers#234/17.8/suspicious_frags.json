  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify the function parameters themselves (pp, ioffptr, next_state) or otherwise violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Specific points inspected:\n\n- char *buf = (char *) &pp[1]; \u2014 This computes an address based on the pointer parameter pp but does not assign to or modify the pp parameter itself (no pp = ...). This is pointer arithmetic/reading only.\n\n- buf[newline] = '\\0'; \u2014 This writes to the memory pointed to by buf. Modifying objects addressed by pointer parameters is permitted by Rule 17.8; the rule only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself. There is no assignment to pp here.\n\n- pp->skip_rn = RN_Full; pp->state = next_state; pp->skip_rn = RN_OptN; try_get_value(..., &pp->content_name); try_get_value(..., &pp->content_filename); try_match_header(..., &pp->content_type); try_match_header(..., &pp->content_transfer_encoding); \u2014 All of these modify members of the structure pointed to by pp. Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule; the pointer variable pp is not reassigned.\n\n- (*ioffptr) += newline + 1; \u2014 This updates the object pointed to by ioffptr. The rule permits modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter; what would be forbidden is assigning to the pointer variable ioffptr itself (e.g., ioffptr = ...), which does not occur.\n\n- next_state is used but not assigned to; there is no modification of the by-value parameter next_state.\n\nNo occurrences of assignments such as pp = ..., ioffptr = ..., or next_state = ... were found. Therefore there are no fragments that should be investigated for violation of Rule 17.8."
