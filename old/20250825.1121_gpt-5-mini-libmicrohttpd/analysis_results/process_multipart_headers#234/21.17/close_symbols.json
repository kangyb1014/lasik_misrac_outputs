  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (definition)\n  Reason: process_multipart_headers indexes into the buffer via buf = (char *) &pp[1]; and uses fields pp->buffer_pos, pp->buffer_size, pp->skip_rn, pp->state and several content_* fields. To prove no out-of-bounds access you must know the layout and sizes of the struct, the meaning and types of those fields, and how the in-memory buffer is arranged relative to the struct.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (macro)\n  Reason: This macro supplies the constant length passed to MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ and used as an index into buf. Its exact expansion determines the number of bytes compared/skipped and therefore whether accesses like &buf[MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(...)] are in bounds.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (function)\n  Reason: The code uses this function to compare the header prefix. To determine if it may read past buf (or the static string) you must inspect its implementation (how many bytes it reads, whether it reads beyond the n parameter, whether it calls other string functions unsafely).\n\n- charsequalcaseless (function)\n  Reason: static call graph shows MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ calls this helper. Its implementation may perform byte accesses or call string.h routines; it must be inspected to ensure no out-of-bounds reads of buf.\n\n- try_get_value (function)\n  Reason: Invoked with &buf[offset] and a target pointer to write into pp->content_name/filename. Its implementation may read further into buf (e.g. strstr/strchr/strlen) or write into destinations. To check compliance with the string-bounds rule you must see whether try_get_value reads past the provided buffer slice or writes using string.h routines in an unsafe way.\n\n- try_match_header (function)\n  Reason: Called with the whole buf and a length macro for header prefix. It will parse the header and may call MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ and other string functions; its code is necessary to see what string.h calls are made and whether any read/write exceeds the buf bounds.\n\n- MHD_create_post_processor (or allocator that allocates MHD_PostProcessor + buffer)\n  Reason: process_multipart_headers assumes the character buffer resides immediately after the struct (buf = &pp[1]) and that pp->buffer_size bytes are available. The allocator/creator establishes how much memory was allocated and how buffer_size/buffer_pos are initialized; you must confirm the allocation matches the assumed layout and that indexing buf[newline] up to buffer_size-1 is valid.\n\n- enum PP_State (definition)\n  Reason: process_multipart_headers assigns pp->state and uses next_state; understanding state transitions is not directly about string.h, but required to see whether other callers may call this function with inconsistent buffer fields.\n\n- RN_Full, RN_OptN (definitions)\n  Reason: These control skip_rn values used later to skip newline characters; knowing their semantics helps trace subsequent parsing and ensures no extra reads/writes are deferred that could cause out-of-bounds usage.\n\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO (definitions)\n  Reason: Return values influence caller behavior (e.g. whether more data will be read). To reason about possible sequences of calls that affect buffer_pos/buffer_size and thus future string accesses you need to know what callers do on these return codes.\n\n- Any string.h functions called by the above implementations (e.g. strlen, strchr, memcpy/memmove, strncpy, strnlen, memcmp)\n  Reason: MISRA rule applies specifically to string.h functions. If MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_, charsequalcaseless, try_get_value, try_match_header or the allocator call any standard string functions, you must inspect how those functions are called (arguments and lengths) to ensure they cannot access beyond the referenced objects. Listing/inspecting the exact calls (and their argument values) is necessary to verify compliance.\n\nSummary: To determine whether process_multipart_headers itself (and the helpers it invokes) can cause string.h calls to read/write beyond buffer bounds you need the structure layout and buffer allocation, the exact length macro used, the implementations of the header-parsing helpers (and their callees such as charsequalcaseless), return/enum constants that affect control flow, and the actual string.h calls used inside those helpers. Inspecting those symbols will allow a concrete bounds proof for every string/memory operation originating from process_multipart_headers."
