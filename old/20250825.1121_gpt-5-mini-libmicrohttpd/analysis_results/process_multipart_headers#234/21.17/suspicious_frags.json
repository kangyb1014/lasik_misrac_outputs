  "explanation": "I flagged every site that either invokes (or likely invokes via helper macros) string-handling operations or produces pointers/indices into the buffer that such functions will read from or write to. These fragments must be investigated because they can lead to reads/writes beyond the bounds of the buffer passed to string routines: the buf pointer derived from &pp[1], the loop that scans buf[], the null-termination write buf[newline] = '\\0', the case-insensitive comparison macro MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (which compares a fixed length), the subsequent calls that pass &buf[offset] into try_get_value, and the try_match_header calls that pass buf and a static length. All of those are potential sites where string.h functions (or mem* style operations hidden behind macros/helpers) could access beyond the actual available bytes and therefore must be checked for correct length/terminator handling and bounds. Other lines in the function (state assignments, simple returns, skip_rn updates, and control-flow logic not listed above) do not invoke string handling nor create new pointers into the buffer and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.17."
