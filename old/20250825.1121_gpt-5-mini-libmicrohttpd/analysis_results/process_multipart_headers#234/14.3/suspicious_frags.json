  "explanation": "I focused on loop controlling expressions because MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 prohibits invariant controlling expressions (infinite or constant loops) unless explicitly allowed by the rule (infinite loops used deliberately or the specific do-while exception). The listed fragments are all loop controls present in the provided code and thus are the primary candidates for being invariant at compile time or becoming infinite due to incorrect assumptions about the data they iterate over; they should be inspected to ensure they are not constant/invariant or intentionally infinite per the exceptions.\n\nOther conditional expressions (if statements, returns, simple comparisons) were reviewed and are not reported because they depend on runtime state or function results (e.g., checks against pp->buffer_pos, pp->buffer_size, string-comparison function results, pointer NULL checks). Those expressions are not syntactically constant or constant-foldable in the shown context and modify/are modified by loop iterations or by function inputs, so they do not appear to violate Rule 14.3. No do-while constructs or obvious literal-constant loop conditions (such as while(1) or while(0)) were found in the supplied code. If additional surrounding code or macro definitions (not provided) define any of the loop bounds/macros as compile-time constants that would make these controls invariant, those cases should be re-examined."
