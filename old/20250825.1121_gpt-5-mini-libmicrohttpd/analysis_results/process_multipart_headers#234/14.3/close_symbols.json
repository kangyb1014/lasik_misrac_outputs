  "explanation": "For MISRA rule checking we need the minimal set of related declarations/definitions to decide whether any controlling expression in process_multipart_headers is in fact invariant at runtime or depends on values that can change: \n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: required to know types and semantics of fields referenced in controlling expressions (buffer_pos, buffer_size, state, skip_rn, content_*). Determining whether expressions like (newline < pp->buffer_pos), (newline == pp->buffer_size), or (newline == pp->buffer_pos) can vary depends on these field types, their valid ranges, and whether they may be modified elsewhere.\n\n- enum PP_State (PP_Error etc.): gives meaning/type of pp->state assignments and whether any compiler/enum-related invariants apply (not strictly a controlling expression here, but needed to understand full context of pp fields).\n\n- RN_Full and RN_OptN: values assigned to pp->skip_rn; needed to ensure assignments do not interact with controlling expressions or represent special sentinel values that could make later tests invariant.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: return-value macros/constants used throughout; needed to determine whether returns encode special/constant behavior relevant to MISRA analysis (e.g. constant-return branches).\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: the call appears in a controlling if. To decide if that controlling expression can be invariant we must know the function prototype/semantics (does it depend only on its arguments, is it pure, could it be a macro/inline that always returns a constant, or have side-effects that change program state?). Knowing whether it can be evaluated to a constant or relies on mutable data is essential.\n\n- charsequalcaseless: static call graph shows this as a callee of MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_. Its behaviour may determine if comparisons are pure/predictable and thus whether the if-condition is invariant.\n\n- try_get_value and try_match_header: these functions are invoked after the header-parsing decisions. Although they are not in the loop condition, their prototypes/semantics are necessary to confirm they do not mutate pp->buffer_pos, pp->buffer_size, or the buffer memory in a way that would affect the validity of earlier/later controlling expressions (and to reason about side effects that could lead to invariance elsewhere).\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ macro: used for indexing into buf in the comparisons and subsequent calls. Knowing its expansion (constant value) is needed to reason about the pointer arithmetic and whether the buffers/offsets used in the controlling checks are fixed constants.\n\n- post_process_multipart (caller): needed to see how pp (and specifically pp->buffer_pos and pp->buffer_size and the memory layout where buf = (char *)&pp[1]) is initialized and updated before calling process_multipart_headers. That caller-level information is essential to determine whether the controlling expressions in this function could be invariant given the guaranteed preconditions (e.g., invariants such as buffer_pos <= buffer_size, or fixed buffer_size values).\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine (a) which operands of each controlling expression can change during execution of the construct (loop or if), (b) whether any called function used in a controlling expression is guaranteed to return a constant, and (c) whether any program-level invariants (from the struct or caller) make a condition effectively invariant. Without these, one cannot soundly conclude MISRA compliance for the rule on invariant controlling expressions."
