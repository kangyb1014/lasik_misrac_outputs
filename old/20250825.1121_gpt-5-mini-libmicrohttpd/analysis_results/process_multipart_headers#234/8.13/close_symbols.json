  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer in process_multipart_headers should be const-qualified, the analyzer must know exact types and constness of the data and function parameters that interact with those pointers: \n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): The function reads and writes many members of pp and derives buf from &pp[1]. The struct definition reveals the types of members (so we can see whether members themselves are pointer types that could/should be const-qualified) and whether the trailing memory layout makes &pp[1] point to modifiable data.\n\n- types of all MHD_PostProcessor members used (buffer_pos, buffer_size, skip_rn, state, content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding): Knowing exact member types (e.g. whether content_name is char * or const char *) is essential to check if they should be declared const and whether passing &pp->content_name to helpers respects const correctness.\n\n- enum PP_State and values (PP_Error etc.): Needed because pp->state is written; if PP_State or related APIs expect const-qualified pointers or immutable state, that could affect whether pp should be const.\n\n- type/definition of skip_rn and RN_Full, RN_OptN: skip_rn is assigned RN_Full/ RN_OptN; its type (enum or integer) and definition must be known to confirm mutability and whether skip_rn is correctly non-const.\n\n- prototype/definition of try_get_value: Called with &buf[...] and &pp->content_name / content_filename. We must know the parameter types (e.g. const char *hdr, const char *key, char **dest?) to determine whether the buffer argument could be const and whether content_name members should be const-qualified.\n\n- prototype/definition of try_match_header: Called with string literal, length, buf, &pp->content_type / content_transfer_encoding. Parameter constness tells if buf must be mutable or may be const, and whether the destination members should be const-qualified.\n\n- prototype/definition of MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (including const qualifications of its parameters): Used to compare a literal to buf. If its signature takes const char * for the buffer, buf could be const; if it takes non-const char *, buf must remain non-const. Also affects whether callers should pass const pointers.\n\n- definition of MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ (macro or inline function): Its expansion is used when forming buffer offsets (&buf[MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(...)]). While not directly about constness, it is used in calls to helpers and confirming types/overloads matters for const qualification.\n\n- definitions of MHD_YES and MHD_NO: Return macros/constants indicate function return type expectations but also help determine whether the function is intended to mutate pp (side effects consistent with non-const pp).\n\n- definition / implementation of MHD_create_post_processor (allocation/layout of MHD_PostProcessor and the trailing buffer) (optional but useful): process_multipart_headers computes buf as (char *)&pp[1]; to decide whether buf could be const, we must know how the post-processor and its trailing buffer are allocated and whether that buffer is intended to be mutable. The allocator/creator code shows if the buffer is writable memory (so buf must be non-const) or if any const qualifiers are expected upstream.\n\nProviding these symbols lets the analyzer determine whether pointers (buf, pp, and the struct's string members) could legally and sensibly be declared const (or whether function signatures require non-const), which is required to assess compliance with the MISRA rule about qualifying pointers with const whenever possible."
