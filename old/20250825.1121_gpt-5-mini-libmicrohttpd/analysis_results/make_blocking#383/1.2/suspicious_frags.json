  "explanation": "I examined the entire make_blocking function and the related symbol definitions. I found no uses of compiler language extensions explicitly documented as extensions (for example: __attribute__ / __declspec, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline asm, label-as-value, zero-length/unnamed bit-fields as compiler extensions, or other vendor-specific keywords). The code uses standard C constructs: preprocessor conditionals (#if defined), typedef int MHD_socket, standard function calls (fcntl, ioctlsocket, abort), integer casts ((int) FIONBIO), and normal bitwise/assignment expressions. The MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS macro and the typedef for MHD_socket are standard preprocessor/type usages, not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
