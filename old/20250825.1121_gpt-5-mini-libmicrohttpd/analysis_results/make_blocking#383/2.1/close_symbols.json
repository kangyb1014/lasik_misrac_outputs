  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if any code in make_blocking is unreachable per MISRA C:\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS: preprocessor selector that controls whether the POSIX branch is compiled. Whether this macro is defined determines if the POSIX code is present or absent (unreachable by build configuration).\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: preprocessor selector for the Windows branch. Its definition status determines whether the WinSock code is compiled. Knowing these two macros is necessary to decide which portions of the function are actually present in the compiled binary.\n- O_NONBLOCK: compile-time macro used in the conditional expression ((flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags). If O_NONBLOCK had a constant value (for example 0) that makes the condition always false/true at compile time, that could render the inner block unreachable. Its value affects reachability of the second conditional branch.\n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL: constants passed to fcntl; knowing them isn\u2019t strictly about runtime reachability but is necessary if you want to reason about whether fcntl can fail or what it returns in a given environment; they identify the fcntl operations being invoked.\n- FIONBIO: constant used with ioctlsocket on Windows. Its presence/meaning is needed to reason about whether that ioctl invocation is meaningful and if the condition may be trivially true/false in a given build/port.\n- fcntl: runtime function whose return values (and whether it is available for the target platform) determine whether the error checks/branches inside the POSIX block are actually reachable. If fcntl is not present on the target or is known to never return -1 in the build context, some branches could be considered unreachable.\n- ioctlsocket: runtime function for the Windows branch; its behavior/availability determines whether the Windows abort path can ever be taken (reachability of that branch).\n- abort: called on error paths. Knowing abort is not required to decide compile-time reachability, but necessary to understand that those branches are error-handling termination paths (and that they are not no-op dead code).\n- MHD_socket: the typedef/underlying type of fd. On some platforms this maps to an int, on Windows to SOCKET; the type can affect which API calls are valid and thus whether a branch is ever reached/compiled.\n- send_all: a direct caller of make_blocking. To decide whether make_blocking is reachable in the whole program you must know if send_all is reachable/used.\n- run_usock: a direct caller (and an entry-point in the given call graph). You must inspect run_usock (and whether it is reachable from program entrypoints) to determine whether make_blocking is ever invoked.\n- ws_send_frame, ws_receive_frame, MHD_upgrade_action: functions that appear in the same call graph as callers/callees around run_usock/send_all. Their reachability or their calls into send_all/run_usock can affect whether make_blocking is ever invoked. \n\nIn short: the preprocessor symbols determine which portions of the function are present in the binary; the macros and system calls used inside determine whether any conditional inside the compiled branch can be proven always true/false; and the callers (and their reachability) determine whether the function itself is ever reachable from program entrypoints. All are needed to decide if any code in make_blocking is unreachable under MISRA C criteria."
