  "explanation": "I flagged platform- or configuration-specific conditional-compilation branches that are likely excluded (and therefore potentially unreachable) under the provided project configuration (#define MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS 1 and no windows/HTTPS/large-size macros shown). These branches are the primary source of unreachable code for Rule 2.1 in this file and should be investigated to confirm they are intentionally excluded or removed.\n\nOther code fragments were not flagged because they are either within the active POSIX branch (e.g. the POSIX make_blocking implementation), are runtime-dependent branches (e.g. ws_receive_frame's runtime opcode handling and the normal-length branches in ws_send_frame), or are simple control-flow constructs that are reachable depending on runtime data (loops, error checks, mutex operations, and the switch cases in MHD_upgrade_action). Those remaining fragments therefore do not present obvious unreachable-code issues based on the provided definitions and so do not require investigation for Rule 2.1."
