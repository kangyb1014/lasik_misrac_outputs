  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code fragment. The parameter fd is only used as an argument to system calls (fcntl and ioctlsocket) and is never assigned to or otherwise altered within make_blocking. The only pointers in use are to local variables (e.g., &flags passed to ioctlsocket), not to the fd parameter. Therefore no code in this function appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and there are no suspicious fragments to investigate further."
