  "explanation": "- MHD_socket: Must know the underlying type of the parameter fd (integer file-descriptor type vs pointer type or macro) to determine whether assigning to or passing it by value would violate the MISRA rule about modifying a function parameter.\\n- fcntl prototype: Needed to confirm that fcntl takes fd by value (int) and does not modify the fd parameter itself (ensures make_blocking only passes fd and does not change the parameter).\\n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK: These macros/constants affect the expressions using fd and flags; also check whether any macro expansion could syntactically modify fd (rare but possible). Knowing they are simple integer constants ensures no hidden modification of the parameter.\\n- ioctlsocket prototype: Needed to confirm that ioctlsocket takes the socket by value (not by pointer) and that the third argument is a pointer to flags (so only the referent is modified), therefore the fd parameter is not modified by that call.\\n- FIONBIO: Needed to verify it is a constant/command macro and does not expand to code that could modify fd.\\n- abort prototype: Included to confirm that error-handling calls do not alter fd (abort just terminates).\\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS and MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: The active branch depends on these compile-time macros; to determine which code path is compiled and thus which callees/macros to inspect, the configuration must be known.\\nThese symbols collectively let an analyst determine whether make_blocking performs any assignment to the parameter fd or invokes callees/macros that could modify the fd parameter itself (as opposed to modifying the object referred to by fd if it were a pointer)."
