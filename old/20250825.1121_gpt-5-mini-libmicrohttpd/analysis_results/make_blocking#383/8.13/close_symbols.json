  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule about const-qualified pointer targets:\n\n- MHD_socket (typedef): The function parameter fd has type MHD_socket. To decide whether fd is a pointer type (and thus whether it should be a pointer-to-const) we must know the typedef; on POSIX it may be an int, on Windows it may alias SOCKET. Knowing the exact type is essential to determine whether the MISRA pointer-to-const rule applies to the parameter.\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS / MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS (preprocessor symbols): Those macros determine which branch of the function is compiled. The pointer-related analysis differs by branch (POSIX branch uses fcntl with no pointer args; Winsock branch calls ioctlsocket with an address-of operator). The active branch must be known to decide which pointer usages to inspect.\n\n- fcntl (function prototype): On POSIX the code calls fcntl(fd, F_GETFL) and fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, ...). The prototype determines whether any of these calls take pointer arguments (e.g. variadic third argument could be a pointer in other uses) and thus whether pointer-to-const qualification is relevant for arguments passed here.\n\n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK (macros): These macros determine the types and bitwise operations performed on flags variables. Confirming their definitions verifies that no pointer is being passed indirectly (e.g., via macros or cast) and that the flags variables are plain integer types (so MISRA pointer-to-const is not applicable to them).\n\n- ioctlsocket (function prototype): In the Winsock branch the code calls ioctlsocket(fd, (int) FIONBIO, &flags). The prototype (particularly the type and const-qualification of the third parameter) is necessary to determine whether taking &flags violates the \u2018pointer-to-const when possible\u2019 rule or whether the API requires a non-const pointer because it writes to the pointed object.\n\n- FIONBIO (macro): The command value passed to ioctlsocket; knowing its definition helps confirm the intended semantics (whether the third argument is an input or output parameter) and thus whether the pointer passed should/should not be const.\n\n- u_long / unsigned long (typedef): The Winsock prototype typically uses u_long * or unsigned long *. Knowing the exact typedef used by ioctlsocket ensures correct comparison of const-qualification (e.g. u_long * vs const u_long *).\n\nCollectively these symbols let an analyzer determine (1) which code path is compiled, (2) which expressions are pointers or produce pointers, and (3) whether the called APIs expect writable (non-const) pointers or could accept pointers-to-const \u2014 which is necessary to decide compliance with the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointee types."
