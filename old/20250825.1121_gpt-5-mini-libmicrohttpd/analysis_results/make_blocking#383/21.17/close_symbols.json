  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking MISRA C rule (string.h bounds):\n\n- fcntl: make_blocking calls fcntl; to prove the function does not invoke any string.h routine (directly or indirectly) you must inspect fcntl's prototype/implementation or platform wrapper to ensure it does not call string functions or perform buffer accesses.\n\n- ioctlsocket: the Windows branch calls ioctlsocket with a pointer; inspect its prototype/implementation to ensure it does not call string.h functions or cause out-of-bounds accesses of memory passed as arguments.\n\n- abort: called on error paths; examine its declaration/implementation only to confirm it is the standard abort (which does not use string.h functions). This rules out hidden string usage in error handling.\n\n- O_NONBLOCK, F_GETFL, F_SETFL, FIONBIO: these macros/constants determine the behavior and the arguments passed to fcntl/ioctlsocket. Knowing their definitions ensures the flags/argument types are as expected (integers vs pointers) so you can rule out accidental pointer/array usage that would trigger string.h operations or buffer accesses.\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS and MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: the conditional compilation macros decide which branch is compiled; you must know which symbol is defined in the build to know whether the POSIX (fcntl) or Winsock (ioctlsocket) path is used for analysis.\n\n- MHD_socket: the type of fd (socket descriptor) must be known (integer type versus pointer-like wrapper) to confirm that passing fd to fcntl/ioctlsocket does not imply any string/array pointer that could be misused and cause out-of-bounds string operations.\n\n- <fcntl.h> and <winsock2.h>: the relevant headers contain the prototypes and macro definitions for fcntl, flags and ioctlsocket; inspect them to confirm argument types and that no hidden string.h usage exists in inline/wrapper implementations.\n\nNote: make_blocking contains no calls to any string.h functions itself. The symbols above are sufficient to verify that neither the chosen platform branch nor the called system/wrapper functions can introduce string.h calls or buffer accesses that would violate the MISRA rule."
