  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of string-handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The provided make_blocking implementation does not call any of these functions (or any other <string.h> routine). It uses fcntl, bitwise operations on an int, ioctlsocket with an unsigned long pointer, and abort \u2014 none of which are string.h calls that could cause out-of-bounds accesses described by Rule 21.17. The MHD_socket typedef is an int, and the only pointer-like usage is &flags passed to ioctlsocket, which is not a string library function. Conditional compilation branches (POSIX vs WINSOCK) likewise contain no string.h usage. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
