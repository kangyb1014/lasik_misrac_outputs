  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to judge whether any controlling expression in make_blocking is an invariant:\n\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS\n  Reason: The #if/#elif compile-time condition selects which branch of code is compiled. To decide if a controlling expression is invariant you must consider which branch is active; this macro determines that.\n\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS\n  Reason: See above \u2014 this macro is the alternative compile-time selector for the Winsock branch. Both configuration possibilities should be considered when assessing invariance.\n\n- MHD_socket\n  Reason: The type of fd (MHD_socket) can affect how calls such as fcntl() or ioctlsocket() are declared/used and whether conversions could make expressions constant. Knowing the typedef/alias clarifies whether the calls are runtime calls on a runtime descriptor.\n\n- fcntl\n  Reason: make_blocking calls fcntl(fd, F_GETFL) and fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, ...). To determine whether the if conditions that compare fcntl return values are invariant we must know that fcntl is an external/runtime function (not a compile-time constant) and understand its possible return values (e.g. returns -1 on error, and runtime-dependent file status flags). This establishes that the controlling expressions using fcntl are not compile-time invariants.\n\n- F_GETFL\n  Reason: This constant is passed to fcntl to request the file status flags. Knowing its intended use confirms that fcntl(fd, F_GETFL) returns runtime-dependent flags rather than a compile-time constant.\n\n- F_SETFL\n  Reason: This constant is passed to fcntl to set file status flags. Understanding its role is necessary to reason about the runtime effect of the fcntl call used inside a controlling expression.\n\n- O_NONBLOCK\n  Reason: O_NONBLOCK is used in the bitwise expression (flags & ~O_NONBLOCK) != flags and in the value passed to fcntl(F_SETFL,...). To show the expression is not invariant you must know that O_NONBLOCK is a compile-time mask constant applied to a runtime flags value returned by fcntl; the expression depends on the runtime flags value.\n\n- ioctlsocket\n  Reason: In the Winsock branch the controlling expression is 0 != ioctlsocket(...). To decide if that expression is invariant you must know ioctlsocket is a runtime call (not a compile-time constant) and its runtime return values (0 on success, non-zero/SOCKET_ERROR on failure). This demonstrates the expression is not an invariant constant.\n\n- FIONBIO\n  Reason: This constant is passed to ioctlsocket. Knowing its purpose (set/clear non-blocking mode) shows that the call is an operation on runtime socket state rather than a compile-time constant, supporting the conclusion that the controlling expression depends on runtime behavior.\n\n(Notes: abort() is invoked inside the branches but is not part of any controlling expression that might be invariant, so its declaration is not required to decide this MISRA rule. The rationale focuses on whether each controlling expression can be resolved to a compile-time invariant: showing that fcntl/ioctlsocket are runtime functions and that O_NONBLOCK/F_* constants are masks/commands applied to runtime-returned values is sufficient.)"
