  "explanation": "- fcntl: make_blocking calls fcntl (F_GETFL / F_SETFL). To prove absence of direct or indirect self-calls we must verify that fcntl does not (directly or via other project functions) call back into make_blocking.\n- ioctlsocket: on Windows make_blocking calls ioctlsocket. Same rationale as fcntl \u2014 ensure no call chain from ioctlsocket returns into make_blocking.\n- abort: make_blocking calls abort on error paths. Abort could invoke signal handlers or runtime routines; include it to verify no application call path from abort leads back to make_blocking.\n- send_all: send_all is an immediate caller of make_blocking. To determine whether make_blocking participates in any indirect recursion you must examine its callers (and their callees) for cycles involving make_blocking.\n- run_usock: run_usock is another immediate caller and also calls send_all (and other functions). run_usock must be inspected because its call graph could form a cycle that includes make_blocking (mutual/indirect recursion)."
