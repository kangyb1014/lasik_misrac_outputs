  "explanation": "I have flagged the function definitions and call sites that invoke functions whose implementations are not shown in the provided code (ws_receive_frame, ws_send_frame, MHD_upgrade_action) and the surrounding run_usock/send_all bodies that exercise them. Those locations require inspection to ensure there is no direct or indirect recursion involving the shown functions.\n\nFragments that I did not mark as suspicious include calls to well-known system/library APIs and simple local operations: fcntl, ioctlsocket, abort, send, recv, pthread_mutex_lock/unlock, malloc/free, snprintf, basic loop/control statements and simple array/index operations. These are standard/system functions or basic language constructs and \u2014 as presented here \u2014 do not contain user-defined calls that could introduce direct or indirect recursion back into the static functions shown. Therefore they do not require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 based on the provided code."
