  "explanation": "For deciding whether make_blocking is dead code we must know (A) whether it can be reached/executed and (B) whether its effects matter to program behaviour. The listed symbols are needed for those determinations:\n\n- send_all: direct caller of make_blocking (static call graph). Needed to see call-site conditions and whether the call is reachable/used.  \n- run_usock: direct caller of make_blocking and a higher-level routine in the call graph. Needed to determine reachability from program entry points and runtime paths.  \n- ws_send_frame: appears in the static call graph as a caller/callee of routines that call make_blocking; needed to trace call chains and to check whether socket semantics in that path depend on blocking state.  \n- ws_receive_frame: same reason as ws_send_frame \u2014 it participates in the same execution paths and may set/expect socket modes.  \n- MHD_upgrade_action: present in run_usock callees; needed to examine alternate control flows that might make make_blocking relevant or irrelevant.  \n- fcntl: POSIX API used by make_blocking to read/set file flags; its semantics (return values, error cases) determine whether the code path and abort() can be reached and whether removing make_blocking changes behaviour.  \n- ioctlsocket: Windows API used by make_blocking; needed for equivalent reasons on WinSock builds.  \n- abort: used for error handling in make_blocking \u2014 removing the call or the whole function could change program termination behaviour, so its use must be examined.  \n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS / MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: compile-time configuration macros that decide which branch (POSIX or WinSock) is compiled. Required to know which code is actually present in a given build.  \n- F_GETFL, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK, FIONBIO: constants/macros used to manipulate socket/file flags; needed to reason whether the flag operations actually change state (masking logic) and whether they are redundant given other code.  \n- MHD_socket: typedef/alias for the socket descriptor type (e.g., int vs SOCKET). Needed to know which API (fcntl vs ioctlsocket) is correct and whether calls are no-ops on the platform.  \n- socket (socket/accept/connect) and any socket-creation sites: to determine default blocking mode of sockets and whether other code already sets/clears non-blocking, which affects whether make_blocking changes behaviour.  \n- any functions or sites that set/clear O_NONBLOCK elsewhere in the codebase: to detect redundancy\u2014if all code that touches the socket mode already sets it to blocking or never sets non-blocking, then make_blocking could be dead; conversely if other code depends on the transition performed here, make_blocking is not dead.\n\nIn short: you need the callers and surrounding control-flow (send_all, run_usock, ws_* and upgrade action), the platform/build macros to know which branch exists, the system APIs and constants used to change socket mode (fcntl/ioctlsocket, flags/macros), the abort semantics, the socket type/creation sites and any other code that modifies socket blocking state. These symbols let an analyst determine reachability and whether removing make_blocking would change observable program behaviour (termination, I/O semantics, timing)."
