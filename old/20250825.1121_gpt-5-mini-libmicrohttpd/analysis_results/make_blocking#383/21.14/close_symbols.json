  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to determine whether make_blocking violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp for null-terminated strings:\n\n- fcntl: make_blocking calls fcntl. We must inspect its usage sites (and any wrappers) to ensure no hidden memcmp use or macros expand to memcmp. Also to confirm arguments are not strings being compared via memcmp in macros.\n- ioctlsocket: called under the Windows branch; include to check its implementation/wrappers or macros for any memcmp usage that could be attributed to make_blocking.\n- abort: called on error paths; include to ensure no indirect macro or wrapper replaces it with code that uses memcmp (very unlikely but part of close-symbol inspection).\n- O_NONBLOCK: macro tested/manipulated in make_blocking. Include to ensure it does not expand to something that involves memcmp (for completeness when expanding macros).\n- F_GETFL: macro/constant passed to fcntl; include to allow full macro/constant resolution when inspecting the function.\n- F_SETFL: same reason as F_GETFL \u2014 needed to fully understand the fcntl call and macro expansions.\n- FIONBIO: used with ioctlsocket on Windows branch; include for full macro resolution.\n- MHD_POSIX_SOCKETS: conditional compilation symbol \u2014 needed to know which branch is compiled and therefore which calls to inspect for memcmp usage.\n- MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS: conditional compilation symbol \u2014 same as above for the Windows branch.\n- MHD_socket: the typedef/type of the fd parameter \u2014 include to resolve type-based macros or wrappers that might introduce memcmp usage.\n- send_all: a direct caller of make_blocking (from the static call graph). Include callers so the close-symbol set covers nearby functions that might be inlined or otherwise relevant when analyzing whether any use of memcmp should be attributed to this area of the code.\n- run_usock: another caller listed in the call graph; include for the same reason as send_all.\n- memcmp: the standard-library function that the MISRA rule forbids for comparing null-terminated strings. This is the primary symbol to search for in make_blocking, its macros, and its close-symbols (callees/callers/macros) to determine whether the rule is violated.\n\nThis set is the minimal close-symbol neighborhood needed to (1) expand conditionals/macros used in make_blocking, (2) inspect all direct calls and their possible inlined/macro-expanded code, and (3) search for any use of memcmp that would cause make_blocking to violate the MISRA rule."
