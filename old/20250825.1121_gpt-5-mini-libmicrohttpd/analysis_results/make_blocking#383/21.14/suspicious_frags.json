  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I examined all provided code fragments (make_blocking, send_all, run_usock and related snippets). There are no calls to memcmp, and no occurrences of memcmp-like usage for comparing null-terminated strings. The code uses send/recv, snprintf, malloc/free, pthread_mutex functions and custom ws_* helpers, but none invoke the C standard library memcmp to compare C strings. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If memcmp is used elsewhere in the codebase, those locations would need to be supplied for review.)"
