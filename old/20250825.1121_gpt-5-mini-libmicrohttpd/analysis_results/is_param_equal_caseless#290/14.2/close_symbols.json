Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- mhd_assert\n  Reason: mhd_assert is a macro or function used in the target function. Its expansion/implementation could contain code with loops or side-effects (e.g. logging, diagnostics) that would be relevant when checking whether any for-loop behaviour is present in the function body or in functions it calls. The exact macro expansion is required to be sure no for-loops or persistent side-effects are introduced.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n\n  Reason: This function is called from the conditional branch. Its implementation (and any functions it calls) must be inspected because the MISRA for-loop rule treats behaviour of functions called inside loop bodies as part of the loop body. Even though the target function has no for loop itself, callers may call this function inside for loops; to determine whether is_param_equal_caseless can contribute loop-counter modifications or other violations, the callee\u2019s code must be known (it may contain loops or modify objects passed by pointer).\n\n- memcmp\n  Reason: memcmp is used in the non-quoted branch. The implementation of memcmp (or confirmation that the used library implementation is conformant) must be known because it typically contains loops; to judge whether its behaviour can affect loop counters or has persistent side-effects relevant to MISRA rule analysis, the actual implementation or an assurance of its behaviour is required.\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuthParam\n  Reason: The layout and types of the struct (and nested sub-objects) are needed to verify types of members being accessed (value, quoted). In particular, to confirm whether members are ordinary objects, volatile, bitfields, or have side-effecting accessors\u2014factors that affect whether objects used in potential for-loop control expressions could be modified elsewhere.\n\n- MHD_RqDAuthParam.value (fields: str, len)\n  Reason: The code reads value.str and value.len. You must know the exact types and any custom access semantics (e.g. property-like macros, getter functions, volatile qualifiers) to determine whether reading them has side-effects or whether they alias objects modified in loop bodies (relevant for clause 2 and 3 of the MISRA rule).\n\n- MHD_RqDAuthParam.quoted\n  Reason: The boolean flag controls branching. Its definition (type, possible volatile/side-effecting semantics) must be known to ensure reads do not have hidden side-effects and to reason about use of flags as loop-control variables in callers.\n\n- size_t\n  Reason: The type of str_len and value.len. Knowing whether size_t is a plain unsigned integer type in the compilation environment (and not a typedef to a more complex type) is necessary to reason about whether it can serve (or be modified as) a loop counter and to check for potential side-effects.\n\n- bool\n  Reason: The type of param->quoted. The MISRA rule refers to a loop control flag as an object with Boolean type; confirming that quoted is a proper Boolean type (and not a macro with side-effects) is necessary when reasoning about usage in loop control expressions.\n\nNote: The target function contains no for loop itself, but the MISRA phrasing requires examining the behaviour of functions called from within loop bodies. Therefore the implementations/definitions of the above symbols (especially MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n, memcmp and mhd_assert, and the struct/type definitions) are required to fully assess any possible violation when this function is used inside for-loops."
