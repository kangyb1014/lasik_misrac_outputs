  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The only code that can potentially violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (well-formed for loops) is inside MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n; therefore those fragments are reported. Other parts of the provided code do not contain for statements or loop-control constructs and so do not need investigation for Rule 14.2: \n- The function is_param_equal_caseless contains no for loop (it performs assertions, a conditional call to MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n, and a memcmp). These operations do not relate to the for-loop well-formedness rule.\n- The struct definition and the mhd_assert macro are declarations/no-ops and are not relevant to Rule 14.2.\n- Other statements (size_t declarations outside the reported fragments, return statements, the call to memcmp, and the preliminary checks) do not involve for-loop clauses and therefore do not need to be investigated for this rule."
