  "explanation": "The only tokens in the provided code that appear to rely on a compiler-specific language extension are the macro that embeds the GCC-style __attribute__((always_inline)) and the use of that macro in the function declaration. The __attribute__ syntax (and attributes such as always_inline) is a documented compiler extension (e.g. GCC/Clang) and must be checked against the compiler documentation to determine whether it is allowed. All other constructs in the supplied code are standard C (use of bool/size_t, memcmp, literal for-loop, macro mhd_assert((void)0), struct definitions, and the implementation of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n) and do not use compiler-specific extension syntax. Therefore no other fragments need to be investigated for Rule 1.2."
