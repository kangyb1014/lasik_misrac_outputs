  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. is_param_equal_caseless only calls MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n or memcmp. The provided implementation of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n is non-recursive and contains no calls to is_param_equal_caseless or other functions that could call it back. The mhd_assert macro is defined as a no-op ((void)0), so it cannot introduce recursion. There are no function pointers, callbacks, or indirect call mechanisms in the shown code that could create indirect recursion. The use of memcmp is a standard library call and does not call user functions. Therefore there are no direct or indirect self-calls in the provided fragments that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2."
