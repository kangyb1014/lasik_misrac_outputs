  "scenario": "The assert statement itself does not use any <string.h> function and does not perform any memory access; therefore this line alone does not introduce an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. It only checks (at runtime in debug builds) that param->value.len != 0. However, a potential compliance problem could arise if the code relies solely on this assert to guarantee a non\u2011zero/valid length and the assert is compiled out (so no check in production) while subsequent calls to string functions (e.g. memcmp with a non\u2011zero length) can be invoked with an invalid pointer/length \u2014 that would violate Rule 21.17."
