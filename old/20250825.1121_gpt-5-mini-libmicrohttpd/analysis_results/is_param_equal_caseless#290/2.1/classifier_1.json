  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the provided fragment: at run time both the true branch (return MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n(...)) and the fall-through branch (the subsequent return using memcmp) can be reached depending on param->quoted. A violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 would occur only if one branch were provably unreachable at compile time \u2014 for example if param->quoted were a compile-time constant (always true or always false), or if the compiler/linker eliminated code so that the fall-through return could never be executed for any possible inputs. In the given code as shown, that is not the case."
