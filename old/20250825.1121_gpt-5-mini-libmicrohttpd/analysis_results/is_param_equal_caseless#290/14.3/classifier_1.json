  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The controlling expression is 'param->quoted', a runtime struct member that can vary; it is not a compile-time or invariant expression. Therefore Rule 14.3 is not violated. (A violation would occur if the condition were a compile-time constant or provably always true/false.)"
