  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Reasons: \n- None of the function parameters are assigned to or otherwise modified in the body. There are no statements like param = ..., str = ..., or str_len = ....\n- The parameter declarations enforce constness: 'const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param' makes the pointed-to struct const (so the function cannot modify the object referred to), and 'const char *const str' makes both the pointee and the pointer itself const. 'size_t str_len' is a by-value parameter and is not modified in the function.\n- All uses of the parameters are reads only (assertions, member accesses, comparisons, and passing them to MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n or memcmp). Passing parameters to other functions does not count as modifying this function's parameters \u2014 those functions receive copies of the values or pointers.\n- The memcmp and MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n calls do not modify the local parameter variables; at most they may read the memory pointed to, which is allowed by the rule (the rule permits modifying the object pointed to, though here the pointed objects are const anyway).\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
