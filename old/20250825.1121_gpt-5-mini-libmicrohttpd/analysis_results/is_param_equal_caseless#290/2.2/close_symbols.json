  "explanation": "For determining whether any executed operation in is_param_equal_caseless is dead code you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - Reason: The function calls mhd_assert twice. To decide if those assert calls are removable without changing program behaviour (i.e. dead), you must know whether mhd_assert is a no-op in production builds or whether it has observable side effects (logging, aborting, memory accesses). If it has side effects then removal would change behaviour and the asserts are not dead code.\n\n- struct MHD_RqDAuthParam (definition)\n  - Reason: The function reads param->value.str, param->value.len and param->quoted. You must know the declared types, valid value ranges, and any invariants (e.g. whether value.len can be zero, whether value.str can be NULL, or whether quoted is ever set) to decide if any branch or expression is unreachable or removable without affecting behaviour.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n (implementation / specification)\n  - Reason: The quoted-branch delegates to this function. To know whether that branch is necessary (or whether it duplicates the non-quoted comparison), and whether the call has side effects, you need the implementation or contract of MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n. If it is pure and always returns the same result as the non-quoted path for the caller's inputs, the call might be dead; if it has side effects, it is not removable.\n\n- memcmp (stdlib)\n  - Reason: The non-quoted branch uses memcmp. To reason whether that call is removable or has side effects you must rely on memcmp's semantics (it is a pure comparison with no side effects). Explicitly listing memcmp clarifies that its removal would change behaviour (it produces the comparison result), so it is not dead.\n\n- MHD_get_rq_dauth_params_\n  - Reason: This is the likely producer/initializer of MHD_RqDAuthParam instances. To determine whether certain fields (quoted, value.str, value.len) can take values that make branches in is_param_equal_caseless unreachable or redundant, you must inspect where and how params are constructed/initialized.\n\n- digest_auth_check_all_inner\n  - Reason: It is the direct caller shown in the static call graph. You must inspect the call-sites to see typical/guaranteed argument values (str, str_len) and any preconditions on param passed to is_param_equal_caseless. Invariants established by the caller can make parts of is_param_equal_caseless dead (or conversely prove they are live).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine: (a) whether the asserts have side effects (affecting dead-code status), (b) whether the quoted branch can ever be taken or is redundant given call-site invariants, and (c) whether removing any of the function's operations would or would not change program behaviour (the MISRA dead-code criterion)."
