  "explanation": "The only potentially relevant MISRA Rule 8.13 issue here is whether the struct member param->value.str is declared to point to a const-qualified type. The three fragments above are all usages of param->value.str and should be investigated because the declaration of that member is not provided. All other pointer usages in the shown code are already const-qualified: the function parameter is 'const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param', the 'str' parameter is 'const char *const str', and MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n declares its string parameters as 'const char *'. memcmp accepts const void * arguments. Non-pointer members (param->value.len) and boolean flags (param->quoted) are not relevant to Rule 8.13. Therefore no other fragments require investigation for this rule."
