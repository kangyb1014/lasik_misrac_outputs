  "explanation": "The only use of memcmp in this function is in the final return expression; that call must be investigated because MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Other fragments do not need investigation for this rule: the mhd_assert lines only check for non-NULL and non-zero length (no string comparison); the branch that calls MHD_str_equal_quoted_bin_n handles the quoted case via a dedicated helper (not memcmp); the explicit length equality check (str_len == param->value.len) is a numeric comparison, not a string comparison. No other memcmp calls or obvious string-comparison operations appear in the provided code, so no additional fragments are relevant to Rule 21.14."
