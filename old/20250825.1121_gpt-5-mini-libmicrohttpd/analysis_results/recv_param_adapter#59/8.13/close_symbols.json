  "explanation": "- MHD_recv_: The function passes the parameter \"other\" directly to MHD_recv_. To decide whether \"other\" could be declared as a pointer-to-const, the analyzer must know MHD_recv_\u2019s prototype and semantics (does it write into the buffer or only read it?). If MHD_recv_ writes into the buffer, \"other\" must be non-const. Include the declaration and documentation/semantics.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The target function dereferences the connection pointer (connection->socket_fd, connection->state) and (conditionally) modifies connection->epoll_state. To determine whether the incoming pointer could be const, the analyzer needs the struct definition (at least the types of socket_fd, state and the epoll_state field) to see whether any members are modified.\n\n- enum MHD_EpollState: The code clears a bit from connection->epoll_state using this enum type. The exact type/definition is needed to confirm that epoll_state is actually modified (which prevents making the connection pointer const) and to understand the operation performed.\n\n- MHD_EPOLL_STATE_READ_READY: The bitmask/ enumerator used in the epoll_state modification. Knowing this symbol confirms that the code performs a write to connection->epoll_state (bit clear), so connection cannot be const when EPOLL_SUPPORT is enabled.\n\n- EPOLL_SUPPORT: The modification of connection->epoll_state is guarded by #ifdef EPOLL_SUPPORT. To decide whether connection must be non-const in all build configurations (MISRA requires considering feasible builds), the analyzer must know whether EPOLL_SUPPORT may be defined. If EPOLL_SUPPORT is never defined, the function does not modify connection and a const-qualified pointer might be possible; if it can be defined, the pointer must remain non-const.\n\n(Other symbols in the function such as the error-check macros and MHD_SCKT_SEND_MAX_SIZE_ affect control flow or limits, but do not affect whether the pointer parameters could be const, so they are not necessary for the pointer-constness analysis.)"
