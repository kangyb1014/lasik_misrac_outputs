  "explanation": "No use of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is present in the provided code. The only data-copy/receive operation is via the macro MHD_recv_, which expands to a call to the socket function recv(...) \u2014 this is not one of the standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) covered by Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments invoking the named string-handling functions that need investigation under Rule 21.17. Note: while boundary/overflow concerns could exist for the recv() use (caller must ensure the buffer pointed to by 'other' is at least 'i' bytes), such concerns are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 because recv is not a <string.h> function."
