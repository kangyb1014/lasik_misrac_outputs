This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n\n- MHD_recv_: This function is the direct callee that writes into the pointer parameter \"other\". To determine whether any string.h functions are invoked (and whether writes respect the provided length), you must inspect MHD_recv_ prototype and implementation (how many bytes it writes, whether it uses memcpy/memmove/strncpy/etc., and whether it can write more than the supplied length i).\n\n- MHD_SCKT_SEND_MAX_SIZE_: recv_param_adapter clamps i to this macro. The numeric value and semantics of this macro are required to reason about the maximum number of bytes that may be requested from MHD_recv_, and therefore to check buffer-overflow risk relative to the actual buffer size of \"other\".\n\n- All callers of recv_param_adapter (from the static call graph): recv_param_adapter receives the void *other from its caller(s). To determine if any string.h functions could cause out-of-bounds accesses you need to know what actual object is passed as \"other\" (its declared type and allocated size). That information lives in the caller(s).\n\n- For each caller: the buffer allocation/definition and its size variable(s) used when passing the \"other\" pointer: For MISRA's string-bounds rule you must compare the maximum number of bytes that may be written into \"other\" (determined by i after clamping and by MHD_recv_ behavior) against the actual allocated size of the object pointed to by \"other\". Therefore you need the exact allocation sites or buffer declarations and any length variables used by the caller when calling recv_param_adapter.\n\n- Any functions that MHD_recv_ calls (transitively) that perform string.h operations: If MHD_recv_ itself calls helper functions (or system APIs) that internally use memcpy/memmove/strncpy/etc., those callees may be the site of an out-of-bounds write. You must inspect those functions (or list them) to determine whether they respect the provided length argument or could copy more bytes than allowed.\n\nNotes: The socket-error helpers and epoll-state macros in recv_param_adapter are not relevant to detecting misuse of string.h functions. The focus for the MISRA rule is (1) what MHD_recv_ actually writes into the buffer and whether it (or its callees) use string.h routines, and (2) the exact allocated size of the \"other\" object(s) passed in by the callers."
