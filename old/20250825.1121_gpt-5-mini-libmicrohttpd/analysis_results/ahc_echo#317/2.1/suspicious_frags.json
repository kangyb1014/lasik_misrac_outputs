  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Rationale: \n- All return statements are conditional (based on method or *req_cls) so none produce code that is unconditionally unreachable. Each branch can be taken at runtime (e.g. non-GET methods trigger the first return; first invocation triggers the &aptr != *req_cls branch; subsequent invocation can reach the response creation). \n- There is no code placed after an unconditional return that would be unreachable. The (void) casts are executed no-op expressions to suppress warnings and are reachable. \n- The response creation, queuing, destruction and final return are reachable when method equals \"GET\" and *req_cls equals &aptr. \n- There are no unused labels, dead loops, or statement sequences that are syntactically unreachable. \nGiven the control flow and the use of the static sentinel aptr, every statement in the function can be executed under some runtime condition, so no fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
