True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe code assigns the address of the static int aptr to *req_cls (a void *). aptr is not const-qualified yet it is only used as an immutable sentinel (its address is stored and compared, never modified through that pointer). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible (e.g. make aptr const or use a pointer-to-const), so this assignment violates the rule.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations: a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. In this function the pointer that holds the sentinel is provided by the external API (req_cls has type void **), so the function cannot change that parameter type. The object aptr itself is not a pointer; making it const would change its type to const int and therefore produce an assignment of a const-qualified pointer to a plain void * (dropping const), which would itself be problematic under the rules. In short: the rule governs pointer declarations under the control of the author; here the pointer type is imposed by the API, and changing aptr to const would introduce a qualifier-discard when storing its address in a void *. Therefore the reported violation is not correct."
