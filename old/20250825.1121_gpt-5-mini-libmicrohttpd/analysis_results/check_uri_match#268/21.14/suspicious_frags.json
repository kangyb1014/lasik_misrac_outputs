  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.14 concern is the use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The fragments selected include the memcmp call and the surrounding lines that establish or may affect null termination and the length used for comparison (the memchr that locates '?' and the explicit null writes, plus the unescape callback that returns the new uri_len). Other code in the function (logging, arguments handling, the call to check_argument_match, returns, variable declarations) does not perform comparisons with memcmp on null-terminated strings and thus is not relevant to Rule 21.14 and does not need investigation for this specific rule."
