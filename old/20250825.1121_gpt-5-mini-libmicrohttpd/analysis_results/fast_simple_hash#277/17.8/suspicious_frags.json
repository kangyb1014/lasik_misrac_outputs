  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Specifically:\n- 'data' is only used for read-only indexing (data[0], data[i]) and is declared as pointer-to-const, so the pointee is not written and the pointer itself is not reassigned or incremented.\n- 'data_size' is only compared and used as the loop upper bound; it is not assigned to or modified.\n- The loop uses a local variable 'i' for iteration; no parameter is used as the loop index.\n- The macro _MHD_ROTL32 operates on local variables (hash and a constant 7) and does not modify any function parameter.\nBecause none of the parameters are assigned to or altered, there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
