  "explanation": "_MHD_ROTL32: This identifier is used directly in the target function. It is likely a macro or wrapper; macros can expand to code that assigns to parameters or evaluate arguments multiple times (causing side effects). You must see its definition to confirm it does not modify the formal parameters (data, data_size) or otherwise perform assignments to them.\n\n__builtin_rotateleft32: The static call graph shows the macro/wrapper resolves to this builtin (or an inline function). Inspecting its definition/behavior is needed to ensure it has no side effects that could modify the function parameters (or perform hidden assignments). Although the builtin operates on the local variable 'hash', you must confirm it does not expand to code that writes through any of the function parameters.\n\n(Other symbols such as uint8_t/uint32_t/size_t types or callers are not required to decide whether this function itself assigns to its formal parameters.)"
