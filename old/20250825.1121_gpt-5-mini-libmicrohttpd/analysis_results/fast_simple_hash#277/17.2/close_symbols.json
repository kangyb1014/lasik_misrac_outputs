  "explanation": "To determine whether fast_simple_hash participates in direct or indirect recursion you must inspect the functions that it calls and the functions that call it (and their callers/callees) to see if any path leads back to fast_simple_hash. Each listed symbol is required for that reachability check:\n\n- __builtin_rotateleft32: fast_simple_hash calls this (via _MHD_ROTL32). Confirm it does not call back into fast_simple_hash or into a chain that does.\n- get_nonce_nc_idx: is a direct caller of fast_simple_hash. Inspect its body to see whether it (or any functions it calls) can lead back to fast_simple_hash.\n- check_nonce_nc: is a caller of get_nonce_nc_idx. Needed to trace upward caller paths for indirect recursion.\n- calculate_add_nonce: is another caller of get_nonce_nc_idx. Needed to trace upward caller paths for indirect recursion.\n- calculate_add_nonce_with_retry: listed as a caller of __builtin_rotateleft32. Inspect to ensure it does not call (directly or indirectly) fast_simple_hash, which could create an indirect cycle.\n- md5_transform: also calls __builtin_rotateleft32. Inspect to ensure it does not call (directly or indirectly) fast_simple_hash.\n\nAnalyzing these symbols (their call targets and callers) lets you build the call graph around fast_simple_hash and determine whether any path returns to it, thereby violating the MISRA rule against direct or indirect self-calls."
