  "explanation": "To determine whether fast_simple_hash can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses of objects referenced by pointer parameters to C string functions, the following additional symbols are needed:\n\n- __builtin_rotateleft32 (alias/_MHD_ROTL32): confirm this implemention is a pure bit rotation that does not perform any memory accesses or modify pointer/size state. If it had hidden memory side effects it could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses; in practice the builtin is purely arithmetic but the definition must be known to rule that out.\n\n- uint8_t, uint32_t (typedefs from <stdint.h>): know the sizes and signedness of the element and return types so you can reason about indexing, value ranges and any implicit promotions that might affect loop/control behaviour.\n\n- size_t (typedef from <stddef.h> or <stdint.h>): know the width and unsigned semantics of data_size and loop index i to reason about the loop bounds (i < data_size) and to ensure no signed/unsigned comparison or wraparound issues could lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds indexing.\n\n- get_nonce_nc_idx (direct caller): fast_simple_hash uses the data pointer and data_size parameters; to determine whether accesses data[i] are within bounds you must inspect the caller(s) that construct and pass those arguments. get_nonce_nc_idx is the direct caller and must be examined to see what buffer/data_size it passes.\n\n- check_nonce_nc and calculate_add_nonce (callers of get_nonce_nc_idx): to fully establish the provenance and valid bounds of the buffer and its size you may need to trace further up the call chain. These callers may allocate/derive the buffer or compute data_size; inspecting them is necessary to prove the pointer/size pair are valid for the indexed accesses.\n\nNote: fast_simple_hash itself does not call any functions from <string.h>. The MISRA rule cited targets use of standard string.h functions (memcpy, strlen, etc.). Therefore the primary concern is whether data/data_size passed into fast_simple_hash can cause data[i] to index out of the supplied object \u2014 that requires the type definitions above and examination of the caller(s). No additional string.h symbols are required for analysis of this function body."
