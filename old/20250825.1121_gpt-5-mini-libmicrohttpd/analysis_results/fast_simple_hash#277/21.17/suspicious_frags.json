  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which targets use of those functions) does not apply. The only pointer access is data[i] and data[0]; these accesses are guarded by the data_size check (data[0] and the loop starting at i=1 are only executed when data_size != 0, and the loop iterates i from 1 up to data_size-1), so there is no out-of-bounds access relative to data_size. Therefore there are no code fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.17."
