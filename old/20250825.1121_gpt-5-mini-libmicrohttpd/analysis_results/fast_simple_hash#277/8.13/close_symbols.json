  "explanation": "You need the listed symbols to conclusively check the MISRA rule about pointer const-qualification for fast_simple_hash:\n\n- uint8_t: confirm the actual typedef (typically unsigned char). Knowing the concrete type is necessary to ensure the const qualifier applies to the pointer target type as written and that no unusual typedef obscures mutability semantics.\n\n- size_t: confirm the typedef (typically from <stddef.h>) to rule out any project-specific typedefs/macros that might affect the function signature or introduce side effects.\n\n- _MHD_ROTL32 / __builtin_rotateleft32: examine the macro or wrapper implementation (and the builtin it uses) to ensure it does not access or mutate the data buffer via hidden side-effects. If the rotation macro were to reference or modify 'data' through some expression or side-effect, that could affect whether 'data' should be non-const. Verifying this ensures the function only reads from the const uint8_t *data parameter.\n\n- get_nonce_nc_idx (caller): inspect at least this caller to see how fast_simple_hash is used (e.g., whether callers cast away const, pass non-const pointers, or rely on modifications). While callers passing non-const pointers to a function accepting const is allowed, detecting casts or other patterns in callers can reveal whether the const qualification in the callee is actually viable in the overall codebase.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether fast_simple_hash itself respects the intent of the MISRA rule (the parameter is read-only) and whether any hidden definitions or usage patterns undermine the const qualification."
