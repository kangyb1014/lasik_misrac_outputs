  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for Rule 8.13 were found. The only pointer in the function is the parameter declared as const uint8_t *data, so the pointer already points to a const-qualified type. There are no other pointer declarations, no casts that remove const qualification, no assignments of data to non-const pointer variables, and no returns of pointers. The macro _MHD_ROTL32 operates on an integer type (hash) and does not involve pointer conversion in this snippet. Therefore nothing in this function requires further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
