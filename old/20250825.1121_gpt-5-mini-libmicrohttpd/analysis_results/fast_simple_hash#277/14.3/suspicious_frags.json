  "explanation": "No controlling expressions in the provided function are invariant. The only conditional is if (0 != data_size) which depends on the function parameter data_size, and the for loop for (i = 1; i < data_size; i++) uses i as the loop variable that is incremented each iteration so the controlling expression changes during the loop. There are no do-while loops or explicit constant controlling expressions (e.g. for(;;) or while(1)) that would trigger Rule 14.3. The macro invocation _MHD_ROTL32(hash, 7) uses a constant shift amount but is not a controlling expression. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
