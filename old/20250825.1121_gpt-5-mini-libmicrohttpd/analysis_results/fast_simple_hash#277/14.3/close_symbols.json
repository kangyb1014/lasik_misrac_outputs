  "explanation": "1) _MHD_ROTL32: The loop body calls this macro/function. To prove the loop's controlling expression (i < data_size) is not invariant you must ensure the macro does not modify i or data_size (for example via side effects, aliasing, or hidden global state). Inspect the macro expansion.  \n2) __builtin_rotateleft32: The static call graph shows the macro maps to this builtin. The builtin implementation must be inspected (or the mapping proven side-effect-free) to ensure it cannot alter loop control variables or make the controlling expression effectively invariant.  \n3) size_t, uint8_t, uint32_t: The exact typedefs/qualifiers of these types are needed to confirm properties of i, data and data_size (signedness, width, and whether any platform-specific qualifiers like volatile/const are present that could affect mutability or evaluation of the loop condition).  \n4) data, data_size, i: Although these are local parameters/locals, include them so the analyzer explicitly checks their declarations/qualifiers: data is a pointer-to-const (so accessing data[i] should not alter data_size or i), data_size is passed by value (so cannot be modified externally), and i is incremented in the for header (confirming the loop controlling expression depends on a changing i)."
