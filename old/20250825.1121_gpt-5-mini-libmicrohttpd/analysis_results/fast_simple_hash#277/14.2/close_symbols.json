The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "_MHD_ROTL32: This identifier appears directly in the for-loop body. MISRA requires that the behaviour of the loop body (including any called functions/macros) must not produce side\u2011effects that modify the loop counter or any other object used in the loop header. You must inspect the definition/expansion of _MHD_ROTL32 to ensure it is a pure expression (no assignments, no writes to memory, no uses of the comma operator that produce side effects, and it does not modify i or data_size or any other object referenced in the for header).\n\n__builtin_rotateleft32: The static call graph indicates _MHD_ROTL32 expands/calls this intrinsic. Inspecting __builtin_rotateleft32 (or its mapping in the build) is required to confirm the intrinsic has no side effects (it should be a pure value-returning operation) and thus does not violate the second/third\u2011clause restrictions of a well\u2011formed for loop."
