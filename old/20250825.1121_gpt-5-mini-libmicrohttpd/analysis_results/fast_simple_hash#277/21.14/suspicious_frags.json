  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target function fast_simple_hash and the related get_nonce_nc_idx. Neither contains any call to the Standard Library function memcmp, nor any other direct comparison of null-terminated C-strings using memory-comparison functions. fast_simple_hash operates on a byte buffer with an explicit data_size parameter (not a NUL-terminated string), and get_nonce_nc_idx passes an explicit length (noncelen) when calling the hash. There are no memcmp calls or implicit string comparisons in the supplied code fragments, so there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this input."
