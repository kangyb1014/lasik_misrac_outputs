  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer parameters that should be const-qualified when possible. The only locations in this function that involve pointer-like arguments are the calls to add_new_user_entry (string literals and the REALM argument). There are no pointer declarations, address-of operations, pointer arithmetic, or pointer casts in the rest of this function (the function signature, return statements, and integer boolean expressions like !0 are not pointer-related). Therefore no other fragments in this function are relevant to Rule 8.13 and do not need investigation."
