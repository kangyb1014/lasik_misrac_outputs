  "explanation": "Only the calls to add_new_user_entry are relevant to MISRA C Rule 17.8 because they pass arguments (including pointer-to-char literals) into another function; any modification of those function parameters would occur inside add_new_user_entry and thus those call sites should be investigated. The rest of the code in add_new_users contains no assignments to its own parameters (it has no parameters) and no operations that modify arguments here (the return statements and use of the ! operator on constants do not modify function parameters), so they do not need investigation for Rule 17.8."
