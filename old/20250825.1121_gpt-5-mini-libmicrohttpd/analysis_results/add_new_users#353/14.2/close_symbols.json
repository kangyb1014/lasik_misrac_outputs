The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To apply MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must inspect the bodies of any functions called from add_new_users because the behaviour of the for\u2011loop body includes called functions. Specifically:\n\n- add_new_user_entry: required to see whether it contains any for loops, what loop counters/flags it uses, and whether it calls other functions that affect loop behaviour.\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash: required because it is called by add_new_user_entry; it may contain for loops or modify objects used as loop counters/flags in callers.\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest: same reason as above.\n- REALM (macro/constant): the literal passed from add_new_users may expand to an object or expression referenced in loops; its definition is needed to ensure it is not used improperly as a loop counter/flag.\n- Boolean type definitions used by the above functions (e.g. bool/_Bool/Boolean): MISRA treats loop control flags specially (must be a single identifier of Boolean type). You need the exact typedefs/macros to decide whether any flag in the for clauses is a compliant Boolean type.\n- Any global variables referenced or modified by add_new_user_entry and its callees: the rule forbids using objects in the second/third clause that are modified in the loop body. Global objects accessed/modified by these functions must be known to determine compliance.\n\nProvide the source (bodies) or precise declarations for these symbols so the next analyzer can check the three clauses, loop counters, loop control flags, and side effects inside called functions."
