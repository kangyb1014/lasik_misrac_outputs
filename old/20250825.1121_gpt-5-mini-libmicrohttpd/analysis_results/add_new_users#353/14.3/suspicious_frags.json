  "explanation": "Only the two if statements contain controlling expressions and therefore must be checked for invariance per MISRA C:14.3. Other code fragments in the function (the use of constant expressions like '! 0' as arguments, the final 'return ! 0;', the function signature, and the REALM macro) are not controlling expressions themselves and so are not directly relevant to Rule 14.3; they may influence the value returned by add_new_user_entry but do not by themselves constitute controlling expressions that the rule addresses."
