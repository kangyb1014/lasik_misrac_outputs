  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the supplied function. Reasoning: the function contains two conditional returns that depend on the runtime result of add_new_user_entry; these are not compile-time constant false/true branches that would make subsequent code unreachable. The use of the expressions \"! 0\" (which evaluates to 1) and \"0\" are constant arguments passed to add_new_user_entry but do not introduce unreachable code in this function. The final \"return ! 0;\" is reachable when both prior calls succeed. There are no constructs such as if (0) { ... }, while (0) { ... }, for(;;) with no break, code after unconditional return, or labels/statements that are provably never executed in this fragment, so no parts require investigation for Rule 2.1."
