  "explanation": "I found no controlling expressions that are invariant (constant) and therefore no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3.

Preprocessor conditionals are handled at compile time and are not considered C controlling expressions for Rule 14.3; returns of enum constants are not controlling expressions. No do-while loops or other loop constructs with constant controlling expressions were found. Consequently, there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 14.3."
