  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the void* cls is cast to a mutable struct MHD_Connection* and the connection is passed to functions (MHD_set_connection_value_n, transmit_error_response_static) that may modify the connection state (and connection->daemon is accessed). Since the pointed-to object is not necessarily immutable, using a non-const pointer is appropriate. (If the function never modified the object, then casting to a const-qualified pointer would be required by Rule 8.13.)"
