  "explanation": "I found no uses of language/compiler-specific extensions in the provided code fragment. Specifically checked and not present: \u2022 No compiler attributes or pragmas like __attribute__((...)) or __declspec(...) \u2022 No built-in extensions such as __typeof__, __builtin_*, or __extension__ \u2022 No statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression (GCC extension) \u2022 No nested functions (GCC extension) \u2022 No inline assembly (__asm__, asm) \u2022 No zero-length array or other non-standard array constructs \u2022 No compiler-specific keywords or storage-class extensions \u2022 No use of Microsoft-specific extensions (e.g. __fastcall) or Clang/GCC-only builtins The code uses only standard C constructs: a static function, enum return type and parameter, size_t, a void* cast to a struct pointer, conditional compilation (#ifdef), and macros (e.g. MHD_NO, MHD_set_connection_value_n, _()). These are not compiler language extensions per se. Therefore there are no fragments to report for Rule 1.2."
