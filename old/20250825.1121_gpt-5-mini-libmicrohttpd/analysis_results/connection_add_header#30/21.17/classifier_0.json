  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "True violation: when kind != MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND and either key or value is non-NULL but not NUL-terminated within the provided key_size/value_size, the code calls strlen(key)/strlen(value) which may scan past the end of the referenced object looking for a NUL. Example: caller supplies a buffer of length key_size that contains no terminating '\\0'; strlen(key) will read beyond that buffer and can access out-of-bounds memory, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
