  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided code fragment. The snippet only uses va_list/va_start/va_end and forwards the va_list to parse_options_va; these constructs do not themselves implicate Rule 21.17. The only possible concern would be the implementation of parse_options_va (not provided here) \u2014 if that function uses string.h routines it should be inspected, but that code is outside the given snippet. Therefore there are no code fragments in the shown code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
