True means there is a violation.\n</response format>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:\nThe parameter params is declared as a non-const pointer (struct MHD_InterimParams_ *params). If neither parse_options nor the called parse_options_va modify the object pointed to by params (i.e. they only read its members), then the pointer should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (const struct MHD_InterimParams_ *params). In that case Rule 8.13 is violated. Example specific violation scenario: parse_options simply forwards params to parse_options_va and both functions only read fields of *params; neither writes to the pointee \u2014 yet params is not const-qualified.\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer be to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is not modified. In the snippet shown, parse_options itself does not modify *params \u2014 it simply forwards params to parse_options_va. Whether a Rule 8.13 violation actually exists depends on whether the pointee is modified by parse_options_va (or by other callers that require a non-const parameter). If parse_options_va (and all callers) only read the object, then params should indeed be declared as const struct MHD_InterimParams_ *params and the agent A report would be correct. However, based only on the provided code you cannot determine that: if parse_options_va modifies *params (or other code relies on a non-const parameter), leaving params non-const is required and not a violation. Therefore the agent's claim is speculative and cannot be confirmed from the excerpt alone. To decide definitively you must inspect parse_options_va and any other uses of that parameter type."
