If neither parse_options nor parse_options_va modify the MHD_Daemon object, the parameter should be 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon'. Leaving off const in that situation violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible).\n</scenario>\n\n<instruction>\nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not definitively correct as presented. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 indeed says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible \u2014 i.e. when the pointed-to object is not modified. In the shown parse_options body the pointer is only forwarded to parse_options_va, so whether parse_options should take a const pointer depends on the callee and whether the object is ever modified. If parse_options_va (or any other use) modifies the MHD_Daemon object (or requires a non-const pointer in its prototype), then parse_options cannot be changed to accept a const pointer and there is no violation. If, however, parse_options_va does not modify the object and its prototype could be made const, then both prototypes should be updated and the current code would be a violation of 8.13. Because the code snippet does not show parse_options_va's signature or whether modification occurs, the claim as stated is not provably correct. Recommended action: inspect/change parse_options_va (and any other callers) so that the parameter is const-qualified if the object is not modified."
