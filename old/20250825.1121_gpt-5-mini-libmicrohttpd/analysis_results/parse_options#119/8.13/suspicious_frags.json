  "explanation": "The only potential MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 issues in this function are the non-const pointer parameters and their use when calling parse_options_va; these should be investigated to determine whether the pointers could/should point to const-qualified types. Other fragments in the function are not relevant to Rule 8.13: va_list ap and enum MHD_Result ret are non-pointer locals; va_start(ap, params) / va_end(ap) are correct varargs handling and do not by themselves indicate a missing const qualification; the return statement and the static/function-scope declaration are not related to pointer const-qualification. Therefore no other code fragments need investigation for Rule 8.13 in this function."
