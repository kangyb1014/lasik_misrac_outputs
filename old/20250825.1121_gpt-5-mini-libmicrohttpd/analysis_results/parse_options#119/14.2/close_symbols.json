The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) parse_options_va \u2014 parse_options immediately delegates to parse_options_va. To determine whether parse_options participates in or violates the MISRA for\u2011loop rule you must examine parse_options_va because it may contain for loops that call back into parse_options (the static call graph shows parse_options_va calls parse_options). The MISRA text treats the behaviour of a for loop body as including the behaviour of any functions called from that loop body, so you must see where parse_options is invoked in parse_options_va and whether any enclosing for loops are well\u2011formed and whether parse_options (or what it does) affects loop counters or control flags.\n\n2) MHD_DLOG \u2014 parse_options_va calls MHD_DLOG. If that call appears inside any for loop in parse_options_va, the side effects of MHD_DLOG (macro or function) are part of the loop body behaviour for MISRA analysis. You need the definition/expansion of MHD_DLOG to check for persistent side effects, modifications of loop counters or other objects modified in the loop body, and to verify the second/third clause restrictions."
