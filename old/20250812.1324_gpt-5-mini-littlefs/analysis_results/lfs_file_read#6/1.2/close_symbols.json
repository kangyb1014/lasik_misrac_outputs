  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions of these symbols to determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule). Rationale for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: Macro or function used for locking; if it is a macro it can hide compiler extensions (statement-expressions '({ ... })', GNU typeof, inline asm, __attribute__, __extension__, etc.). Need the definition to verify it is standard C.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its implementation may be a macro that uses extensions.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Almost certainly a macro wrapping formatted tracing. Variadic macro usage, token-pasting, or use of GNU extensions (statement-expression, __builtin_*, inline asm, attributes) may be hidden here. Verify expansion is standard C.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro can use unusual constructs (statement-expression, do/while(0) is fine but other patterns may use extensions). Check definition for nonstandard constructs.\n\n- PRIu32 and PRId32: Format-specifier macros (normally from <inttypes.h>). Confirm they are standard string macros and not redefined using compiler-specific extensions.\n\n- lfs_ssize_t and lfs_size_t: typedefs for sizes/return values. Their underlying types might use nonstandard types or compiler-specific typedefs (e.g., __int128, compiler-specific sized types). Need to check the typedefs to ensure no extensions are used.\n\n- lfs_t and lfs_file_t: opaque types used by the API. Their definitions/typedefs/structs may contain compiler-specific attributes or extensions (packed, aligned, bitfields with implementation-defined widths, zero-length arrays, flexible array members used incorrectly, or compiler-specific keywords). Inspect their declarations.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: The cast to (struct lfs_mlist*) is used; the struct definition could use extensions (anonymous structs/unions, attributes, zero-length arrays, etc.). Verify it is standard C.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: The predicate is passed into LFS_ASSERT; its declaration/definition should be checked because it could be an inline function or macro using extensions.\n\n- lfs_file_read_: Although the wrapper simply calls it, its prototype/definition should be checked if it is implemented as a macro or uses language extensions that affect call semantics or argument evaluation (e.g., statement-expression wrappers, typeof-based overloads, or compiler builtins).\n\nIn short, any macro or typedef used by lfs_file_read can hide nonstandard language constructs. The listed symbols are those whose definitions must be reviewed to conclude whether the target function (as written and expanded) uses any compiler-specific language extensions."
