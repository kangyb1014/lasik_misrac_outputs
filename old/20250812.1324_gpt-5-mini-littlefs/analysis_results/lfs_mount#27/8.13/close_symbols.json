  "explanation": "To judge whether lfs_mount complies with the MISRA guideline that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, the analyser needs the following symbols:\n\n- struct lfs_config (full definition): lfs_mount takes 'const struct lfs_config *cfg' and accesses many members (context, read, prog, erase, sync, read_size, prog_size, block_size, block_count, block_cycles, cache_size, lookahead_size, read_buffer, prog_buffer, lookahead_buffer, name_max, file_max, attr_max). You must see the exact types of these members (in particular which are pointers and whether they are declared as const-qualified) to determine if any should have been declared 'const T *' instead of 'T *'.\n\n- typedefs used inside struct lfs_config (function-pointer types and any lfs-specific size/offset typedefs): the struct may refer to typedefs (e.g. read/prog function pointer typedefs, lfs_size_t, lfs_off_t, etc.). Those definitions are required to see whether pointer targets are already const-qualified or could/should be made const.\n\n- lfs_mount_ (prototype/definition): lfs_mount calls lfs_mount_(lfs, cfg). To determine whether cfg is passed to a non-const parameter (which would drop const and violate the rule or require a cast), you need the exact parameter types of lfs_mount_. Also lfs_mount_ may modify data reachable through cfg, which affects whether members must remain non-const.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definitions/prototypes): these are invoked on cfg at the top and bottom of lfs_mount. If their signatures take a non-const pointer or otherwise mutate cfg, that affects whether cfg (and/or members) must be non-const. You need their definitions to see whether they require removing const qualification or modify pointed-to data.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition/prototype): used to print many cfg members, including casting function pointers to uintptr_t and pointers to void*. If LFS_TRACE is implemented in a way that takes non-const pointer types or performs casts that discard const, that is relevant to the const-correctness analysis. Also some projects wrap trace macros in ways that accept non-const args only.\n\n- lfs_t (typedef/definition): lfs_mount takes lfs_t *lfs. To assess whether this pointer could or should be const (and therefore whether the current non-const is justified), the analyser may need the lfs_t definition and how it is used by lfs_mount_ and other callees.\n\nProviding these symbols (the struct and its dependent typedefs, the prototypes/definitions of the callees/macros that accept cfg) gives the necessary type-level information to decide whether pointers in the API should be const-qualified or whether const would have to be discarded (which could indicate a MISRA violation)."
