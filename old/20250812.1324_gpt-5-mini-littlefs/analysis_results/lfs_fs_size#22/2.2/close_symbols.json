  "explanation": "\u2022 LFS_LOCK: must know whether this macro/function has observable side effects (locks a mutex, changes state, blocks, updates counters, or is a no-op). If it is side-effect free, calls could be dead; if it affects concurrency/timing/state, removal would change behaviour.  \n\u2022 LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 need its implementation to judge whether unlock operations executed by lfs_fs_size are removable without effect.  \n\u2022 LFS_TRACE: logging macro may be compiled out or have side effects (I/O, timing, side-effectful wrappers). To decide if trace calls inside lfs_fs_size are dead, we must see its definition and any compile-time enable flags.  \n\u2022 lfs_fs_size_: the actual work is delegated here. You must inspect its implementation to determine if the surrounding lock/trace/unlock are required for correctness (state protection, ordering) or are redundant and thus the wrapper's operations are dead.  \n\u2022 lfs_fs_traverse_: lfs_fs_size_ calls this; its side effects (state mutation, I/O, timing) can make the wrapper\u2019s actions necessary. Include it to understand transitive effects.  \n\u2022 lfs_t (type): the structure layout is needed to know what lfs->cfg is and whether accesses to lfs (or its fields) produce side effects or are required for correctness.  \n\u2022 cfg (the type of lfs->cfg): the lock/unlock operate on this; its definition reveals whether locking is meaningful (mutex handle, state flags) or a no-op.  \n\u2022 lfs_ssize_t (typedef): to interpret returned values (err vs. size) and determine whether returning err on lock failure changes observable behaviour or could be optimized away.  \n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether the operations performed in lfs_fs_size (lock, two traces, call to lfs_fs_size_, unlock, and returns) have observable effects (state changes, I/O, timing, concurrency) such that their removal would alter program behaviour (i.e., are not dead)."
