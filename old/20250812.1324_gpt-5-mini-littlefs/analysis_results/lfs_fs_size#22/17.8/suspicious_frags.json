  "explanation": "No code fragment in lfs_fs_size modifies the function parameter lfs itself. Specifically:\n- The call int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); passes lfs->cfg to a macro that (per provided definition) expands to ((void)cfg,0) and does not modify lfs or the pointer value.\n- LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_size(%p)\", (void*)lfs); only casts lfs to void* for printing; casting or passing the pointer does not modify the parameter.\n- lfs_ssize_t res = lfs_fs_size_(lfs); passes the pointer to another function. Modifying the object pointed to by lfs inside lfs_fs_size_ is permitted by MISRA Rule 17.8; only changing the pointer parameter itself would be a violation. The call here does not reassign or mutate the lfs parameter.\n- LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_size -> %"
