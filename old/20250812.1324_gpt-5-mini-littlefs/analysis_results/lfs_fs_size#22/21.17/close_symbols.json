  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_size_: direct callee of the target function. Any use of string.h functions (memcpy/strcpy/strlen/...) inside this helper would make the target function indirectly violate the MISRA rule. You must inspect its implementation and its buffer/length handling.  \n- lfs_fs_traverse_: shown as a callee of lfs_fs_size_. It (or functions it calls) may perform string/memory operations; include it to follow the call chain where out-of-bounds accesses could occur.  \n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: macros or functions invoked around the call. They may expand to code that manipulates buffers or call other functions that use string.h routines; inspect expansions to ensure no string.h usage causes out-of-bounds accesses.  \n- LFS_TRACE: logging/trace macro or function used in the target. Trace implementations often format strings and may call string handling routines (strlen, memcpy into log buffers, snprintf wrappers). Inspect its definition to ensure it does not perform unsafe string operations.  \n- lfs_t (type) and lfs_ssize_t (type): definitions are required to know the layout and types of members (notably cfg) and return type width/limits; sizes and signedness matter when reasoning about buffer lengths and integer-to-size conversions that affect bounds checks.  \n- lfs->cfg (the configuration/member type): the object passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and possibly used by callee functions; its definition may include buffer pointers, size fields, or callbacks used in string/memory operations. Inspect its fields to determine how buffers and lengths are derived.  \n\nNote: Also follow any further callees discovered inside lfs_fs_size_ and lfs_fs_traverse_ (and the expansions of the macros above). Any function in that reachable call graph that calls standard <string.h> functions or performs explicit memory copies must be included and inspected for bounds correctness."
