  "explanation": "For MISRA C pointer-const analysis we must know whether the lfs pointer (and any subobject accessed from it) is modified by this function or by callees/macros. Specifically:\n- lfs_t (full definition): to inspect members and determine which subobjects are read-only and whether the API could accept a const lfs_t*. If members are modified anywhere, the parameter cannot be const.\n- type and definition of lfs->cfg field: lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; we need the exact type to know if locking mutates the cfg object or requires a non-const pointer.\n- lfs_fs_size_ (decl & impl): the target forwards lfs to this internal function. Its signature and body determine whether lfs is modified; if it mutates lfs, the parameter cannot be const.\n- lfs_fs_traverse_ (decl & impl): lfs_fs_size_ calls this; it may perform modifications. To decide constness transitively we must see if any deeper callees mutate lfs.\n- LFS_LOCK (definition and expansions): it is used with lfs->cfg; if the lock macro/function mutates cfg or requires non-const pointers, that prevents marking cfg (and possibly lfs) const.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (definition and expansions): same reason as LFS_LOCK; must check if it mutates state.\n- LFS_TRACE (definition): usually read-only, but confirm it does not modify lfs (e.g., by recording state). If it only reads, it doesn't prevent const qualification.\n\nProviding these symbols lets the next analyzer determine whether any use in this function or its immediate callees requires a non-const lfs (or non-const cfg), and therefore whether the lfs_t * parameter could be changed to const lfs_t * per MISRA rule."
