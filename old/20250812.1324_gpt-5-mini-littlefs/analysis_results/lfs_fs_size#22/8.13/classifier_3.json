  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Cannot determine from the single call. The fragment itself does not prove a violation. Rule 8.13 would be violated if lfs_fs_size_ (and lfs_fs_size) do not modify the pointed-to lfs_t object but are declared to take a non-const pointer (e.g. lfs_ssize_t lfs_fs_size_(lfs_t *lfs)). In that case the parameter and the passed pointer should be const-qualified (const lfs_t *), and the current code would violate the rule."
