  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for dead\u2011code (unused code) analysis of lfs_dir_seek:\n\n- lfs_dir_seek_ (definition): lfs_dir_seek simply forwards to lfs_dir_seek_. To decide whether the wrapper is dead (removable without changing behaviour) you must inspect the callee\u2019s side effects and observable behaviour.\n\n- lfs_dir_rewind_, lfs_min, lfs_pair_cmp, lfs_dir_fetch (definitions): These are direct callees of lfs_dir_seek_. Their implementations determine whether lfs_dir_seek_ (and therefore the wrapper) performs observable work (state changes, I/O, timing, synchronization). If all of these do nothing observable, the whole chain may be dead.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/function definition): lfs_dir_seek calls LFS_LOCK and branches on its return. The lock may have observable effects (synchronization, error returns). You must know whether LFS_LOCK can fail or has side effects that make the wrapper non\u2011removable.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function definition): The unlock may have observable effects (releasing resources, waking tasks). Removing the wrapper would also remove the unlock; that could change behaviour, so its semantics must be known.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/function definition): Tracing may be implemented with side effects (I/O, timing). Even if only diagnostic, its presence can be observable in some systems; you must know whether removing these traces would change observable behaviour.\n\n- lfs_t (struct) (definition, including cfg field): The lock/unlock use lfs->cfg; you need the cfg type and any fields accessed by the locking macros to see whether calling lfs_dir_seek affects global/shared state (e.g., modifies cfg, uses counters). Also needed to reason about pointer aliasing and lifetime.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (struct) (definition): The directory object passed to lfs_dir_seek may be modified by the call chain; its layout and semantics are required to determine observable state changes.\n\n- lfs_off_t (typedef): The argument type may affect the behaviour (e.g., special values, overflow handling) and how the call chain behaves; include the typedef to reason about argument semantics.\n\n- callers of lfs_dir_seek (declarations / linkage / export information): To label lfs_dir_seek as dead code you must know whether it is ever called. Static call graph showed no callers, but you must confirm external linkage, header declarations, or dynamic/indirect callers (function pointers, API exported to other translation units). Without callers/linkage info you cannot conclude that the function is unused.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions/implementations and linkage information) lets the next analyst determine whether removing lfs_dir_seek (or any calls inside it) would change program behaviour (state, I/O, timing, synchronization), which is required to decide conformance with the MISRA dead\u2011code rule."
