  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are invoked with lfs->cfg. If they are macros they could expand into code that assigns to or otherwise modifies the lfs or dir parameter variables (e.g. via complex macro expressions). To prove the target function does not modify its pointer parameters you must inspect their definitions/expansions and signatures.\\n- LFS_TRACE: This is a macro taking (void*)lfs and (void*)dir. Macros can expand to code that might modify local variables; its definition is required to ensure it does not perform any assignment to the parameter identifiers.\\n- lfs_dir_close_: Although statically shown as a callee, confirm its declaration/definition to ensure it is a real function (not a macro) and to verify its parameter types. If it were a macro it could expand into code that modifies the caller's parameter variables; if it is a function, it cannot change the caller's pointer variables themselves (only the pointees).\\n- lfs_t (struct/type) and its cfg member type: Needed to understand what lfs->cfg yields (its type and whether using lfs->cfg in the macros could legally cause side effects on the lfs parameter). Also needed to check for any overloaded macros or operator-like constructs that could modify the pointer when accessing members.\\n- lfs_dir_t: Provide the type definition so you can rule out any hidden macro/typedef trickery that might affect how the dir parameter is passed or referenced.\\nThese symbols are the only ones in the target body that could, via macro expansion or unexpected definitions, modify the pointer parameters themselves; inspecting them is sufficient to decide MISRA compliance for \"a function parameter should not be modified.\""
