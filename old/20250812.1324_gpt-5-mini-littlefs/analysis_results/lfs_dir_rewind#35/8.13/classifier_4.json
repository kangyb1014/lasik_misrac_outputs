  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation can be concluded from this single call site. The fragment only passes lfs->cfg to LFS_LOCK; Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types in declarations/parameters. If lfs->cfg (or the parameter type of LFS_LOCK) were declared as a non-const pointer although the pointed object is never modified, that would violate Rule 8.13. For example, a violation scenario would be: lfs->cfg has type 'struct cfg *' and LFS_LOCK is declared as 'int LFS_LOCK(struct cfg *c)' but neither LFS_LOCK nor any callers modify *c \u2014 both should use 'const struct cfg *' instead. As shown, with no declarations available, treat as not violated."
