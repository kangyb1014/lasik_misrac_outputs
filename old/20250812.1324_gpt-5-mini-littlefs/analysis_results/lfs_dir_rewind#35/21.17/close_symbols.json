  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_dir_rewind (and its direct call lfs_dir_rewind_) violate the MISRA rule on string.h usage, the analyzer needs the following additional symbols:\n\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: This is the direct implementation called by lfs_dir_rewind. Any use of memcpy/strncpy/strlen/etc. that could access beyond object bounds will appear here, so its body must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch: lfs_dir_rewind_ calls lfs_dir_fetch (per the static call graph). lfs_dir_fetch may perform string/memory operations on directory or name buffers; its code is required to check bounds and length arguments.\n\n- lfs_dir_seek_: Although a caller of lfs_dir_rewind_, its behaviour is relevant because it may construct or pass buffers/offsets/lengths into the directory APIs. Knowing how callers prepare parameters helps determine whether bounds are respected.\n\n- lfs_t and lfs_dir_t: The definitions of these types are needed to know the sizes, layout, and lifetime of objects passed to string functions (for example pointers to name buffers inside lfs_dir_t). Without the struct definitions you cannot determine whether a string/memory operation can overrun the referenced object.\n\n- lfs->cfg (the configuration struct type and relevant fields): The configuration often contains size limits (e.g. name_max, block_size, cache sizes) that influence buffer allocations and allowed lengths. These fields are required to check that string/memory functions use lengths within object bounds.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function is invoked by the target function. Its implementation may itself call string.h functions (formatting, copying) or build temporary buffers; it must be inspected to ensure it does not perform out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: These macros/functions are used by the target function and could expand to helper code (or include diagnostics) that might use string/memory functions. Include them to be certain the wrapper does not introduce string.h misuse.\n\nAdditionally: the analyzer should include any other transitive callees of lfs_dir_rewind_ and lfs_dir_fetch (i.e., functions they call) whose implementations use Standard string.h functions. Those transitive functions and any constants/macros that define buffer sizes (e.g. NAME_MAX, LFS_NAME_MAX, block size constants) are also required to fully verify compliance with the MISRA string/bounds rule."
