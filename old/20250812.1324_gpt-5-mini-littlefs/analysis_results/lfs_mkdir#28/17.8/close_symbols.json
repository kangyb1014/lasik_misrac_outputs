  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro/function called with lfs->cfg. Its definition could contain code that assigns to the parameter variables (for example via macro expansion that rebinds or writes to 'lfs' or 'path'), so you must inspect it to ensure it does not modify the function parameters.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 unlocking is a macro/function that might expand to statements that could assign to parameters; the macro/body must be checked for side-effects on the parameter identifiers.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is invoked with both parameter identifiers (lfs, path). Macros can expand into code that has side-effects (including assignments). You must inspect the LFS_TRACE definition to ensure it does not modify the parameter variables.\n- lfs_mkdir_ (declaration/definition): The call looks like a simple function call, but lfs_mkdir_ could be a macro or an inline function that expands into code which assigns to the parameters. You need its declaration/definition to confirm it is a normal call and that the target function does not, itself, perform any reassignment of the parameters via that expansion.\n- lfs_t (full typedef/struct definition including cfg member): The parameter lfs is of type lfs_t*. The exact typedef/struct is needed to confirm that any member access (lfs->cfg) used in macros cannot alias or hide the parameter name (e.g., via unusual macro hacks) and to inspect whether accessing cfg triggers inline code/macros that may modify the parameter variable. In short, the concrete definitions of the macros and the type are required to prove no modification of the parameter identifiers occurs in lfs_mkdir."
