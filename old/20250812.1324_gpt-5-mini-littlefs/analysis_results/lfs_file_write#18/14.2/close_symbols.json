Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to judge MISRA rule \"for loop shall be well-formed\":\n\n- lfs_file_write_: This is the direct callee that does the actual write. Any for loops inside it (or loops in functions it calls) are part of the behaviour of calls made from lfs_file_write and must be inspected for the three-clause constraints (single loop counter, allowed side-effects, etc.).\n\n- lfs_file_flush: Called by lfs_file_write_. If it contains for loops, their loop counters, loop-control flags, and any objects modified in the body must be checked against MISRA requirements.\n\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: Called by lfs_file_write_. Same reason as lfs_file_flush: its internal for loops (if any) affect compliance.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called (via LFS_ASSERT) in the target. Although used only in an assertion here, its implementation may contain for loops; the MISRA rule treats behaviour of called functions as part of loop bodies if they are invoked from a for statement, and more generally any for loops in called code must be checked for correct loop-counter usage across the call chain.\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These macros/functions are invoked in the target. Their definitions may contain for loops or modify objects that could serve as loop counters or flags; include them to ensure no hidden for-loops or shared-modified objects violate the rule.\n\n- LFS_TRACE / LFS_ASSERT: These macros may expand to code (potentially with loops or expressions that affect objects). They must be inspected to ensure they do not introduce ill-formed for loops or modify loop counters/objects used by for loops.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t, struct lfs_mlist, lfs_size_t, lfs_ssize_t, lfs_config: Type and struct definitions are needed to determine the types of potential loop counters and loop-control flags used inside the callees (e.g., integer vs Boolean types), and to detect whether objects referenced in for loop clauses are the same objects modified in loop bodies. In particular MISRA defines a loop-control flag as an object with Boolean type; you must see how Boolean-like types are defined and used in the implementations of the callees.\n\nNotes on scope: The static call graph already shows the immediate callees; the above list includes those plus macros and types used directly in the target. If any of the listed callees call further functions (beyond lfs_file_flush and lfs_file_flushedwrite), their definitions should also be pulled in iteratively until all functions that contain for loops reachable from lfs_file_write are available for inspection."
