  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 concerns qualifying pointer target types as const where possible (i.e., declaring pointer parameters/variables as pointing to const when they are not used to modify the pointee). In the snippet the local parameter file is declared as lfs_file_t * (non-const) and is later passed to lfs_file_write_ (which plausibly modifies the file object), so file cannot be const in this function. The cast in the assertion simply converts file to struct lfs_mlist * to match the lfs_mlist_isopen parameter; it does not discard an existing const qualification on file (the probe output shows both casts yield the same address). If lfs_mlist_isopen itself were declared with a non-const parameter despite only inspecting its argument, that would be a deficiency in lfs_mlist_isopen\u2019s prototype (not in this call site). Given the provided test output and the function\u2019s subsequent use of file, there is no evidence that lfs_file_write violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
