  "explanation": "You must inspect any macro or symbol that is expanded/used in the caller because MISRA Rule (function parameter shall not be modified) can be violated by macro expansions in the caller scope. Explanations: \n- LFS_LOCK: may be a macro; its expansion could contain assignments or side effects that modify parameter variables (for example if improperly written). Need its definition to ensure it does not assign to lfs, file, buffer, or size. \n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK (macro expansion could modify caller parameters). \n- LFS_TRACE: typically a macro that expands inline and can evaluate or (incorrectly) assign to arguments; inspect to ensure it does not modify any parameter variables. \n- LFS_ASSERT: macro that may expand to code (including calling functions or doing assignments); verify it does not modify parameters. \n- lfs_file_write_: although shown as a callee, confirm whether it is an actual function or a macro/inline that could expand into assignments to the caller's parameter variables; if it is a function it cannot change the caller's parameter variables, but a macro could. \n- lfs_mlist_isopen: its prototype/definition is needed because it is used inside LFS_ASSERT and might itself be a macro or inline expansion; verify it does not expand to code that modifies the caller's parameters. Note: if it is a normal function it cannot change the caller's parameter variables, but the macro case must be checked. \n- type lfs_t: need the struct definition to check lfs->cfg and lfs->mlist expressions passed to macros (and to review whether cfg or mlist are macros/bitfields that could have unexpected side effects). \n- type lfs_file_t: need its definition to confirm that casting (struct lfs_mlist*)file is safe and to check whether file is a typedef that could be a macro or alias causing modifications when used in macros.\n- struct lfs_mlist: definition to confirm the cast and to see if any field access or macro treats the object in a way that could modify the pointer variable in caller.\nThese symbols (macro definitions and the few type/func declarations) are sufficient to determine whether any expansion or use in lfs_file_write modifies the parameter variables themselves (lfs, file, buffer, size), which would violate the MISRA rule."
