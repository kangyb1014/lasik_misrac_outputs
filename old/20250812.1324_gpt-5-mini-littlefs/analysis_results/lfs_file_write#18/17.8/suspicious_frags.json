  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function appears to modify any of the function parameter variables (lfs, file, buffer, size). Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to the parameter identifiers (no \"lfs = ...\", \"file = ...\", \"buffer = ...\", or \"size = ...\"), nor any increments/decrements applied to them.\n- The calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) operate on the object pointed to by lfs (the lfs->cfg member); they do not reassign the parameter variable lfs itself. Modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8.\n- The LFS_TRACE and LFS_ASSERT macros perform casts ((void*)lfs, (void*)file, (struct lfs_mlist*)file, etc.), which do not change the parameter variables; casting a pointer for use in an expression is not a modification of the parameter.\n- The function simply calls lfs_file_write_(lfs, file, buffer, size) passing the parameters through; passing parameters to another function does not constitute modification of the local parameter variables.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
