  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule about using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any code that might call memcmp on string data reachable from lfs_file_write. Briefly:\n\n- lfs_file_write_: The core implementation invoked by lfs_file_write; it (or its callees) is the most likely place memcmp could be used to compare strings. Must be inspected.\n- lfs_file_flush, lfs_file_flushedwrite: These are direct callees of lfs_file_write_ (shown in the call graph). They must be checked because they may perform low-level buffer/metadata comparisons (possibly using memcmp on string-like data).\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called by lfs_file_write in an assert; it inspects the file/open-list state and may compare name or id strings with memcmp. Include to ensure the assert does not use memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- memcmp: The standard function whose misuse (comparing null-terminated strings) is the rule under scrutiny. The actual usage sites must be found; include the symbol so the analyser searches for direct calls.\n- LFS_ASSERT, LFS_TRACE, LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: These macros/wrappers are invoked in lfs_file_write; their expansions could call helper functions (logging, locking) that might use string comparisons. Include them to rule out indirect memcmp usage from macro expansions.\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t, struct lfs_mlist: Type/struct definitions are needed to understand whether any fields passed into memcmp are null-terminated strings (e.g., name buffers, path components). Knowing field types and ownership lets you determine if memcmp is being (incorrectly) used on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst locate all potential memcmp calls reachable from the target function and determine whether any compare null-terminated strings (i.e., violate the MISRA rule)."
