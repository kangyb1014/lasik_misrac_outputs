  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following lfs_file_truncate code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 8.13.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of lfs_file_truncate.\n```c\nint lfs_file_truncate(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file, lfs_off_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_truncate(%p, %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, size);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    err = lfs_file_truncate_(lfs, file, size);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_truncate -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The call passes the address of a temporary byte literal &(uint8_t){0} to lfs_file_write_. If the lfs_file_write_ prototype accepts a non-const pointer (e.g. uint8_t * or void *buffer), that prototype allows modification of the pointed data even though the caller (and the usage) intends read-only data. The parameter should be declared as a pointer to const (e.g. const void * or const uint8_t *) to reflect that the buffer is not modified. In that case Rule 8.13 is violated by the non-const parameter declaration (not by the call itself).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void lfs_probe_log(const char *fmt, ...) {\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/139.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f) {\n        return;\n    }\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    va_end(ap);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint lfs_file_truncate(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file, lfs_off_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    /* Log lock result and entry state */\n    lfs_probe_log(\"ENTER lfs_file_truncate: lfs=%p file=%p size=%\" PRIu32 \" lock_err=%d\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, size, err);\n    if (err) {\n        lfs_probe_log(\"lfs_file_truncate: early return due to lock error=%d\", err);\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_truncate(%p, %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, size);\n\n    /* Probe the is-open check so callers can see preconditions that may\n       lead to calls that pass temporary buffers (e.g. &(uint8_t){0}). */\n    int isopen = lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file);\n    lfs_probe_log(\"lfs_file_truncate: lfs_mlist_isopen=%d\", isopen);\n\n    LFS_ASSERT(isopen);\n\n    lfs_probe_log(\"lfs_file_truncate: invoking lfs_file_truncate_ with lfs=%p file=%p size=%\" PRIu32,\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, size);\n\n    err = lfs_file_truncate_(lfs, file, size);\n\n    lfs_probe_log(\"EXIT lfs_file_truncate: return=%d lfs=%p file=%p size=%\" PRIu32,\n            err, (void*)lfs, (void*)file, size);\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_truncate -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for lfs_file_truncate.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is about declarations: a pointer parameter (or other pointer object) should be declared to point to a const-qualified type whenever the pointed-to object is not modified by the function. The provided lfs_file_truncate implementation declares parameters lfs_t *lfs and lfs_file_t *file; nothing in the snippet shows a pointer-to-non-const that could obviously be const. The agent\u2019s scenario refers to a different function (lfs_file_write_) and to that function\u2019s prototype: if lfs_file_write_ takes a non-const buffer pointer even though it does not modify the buffer, then that prototype (not the call site) would be the place to check for a Rule 8.13 violation. Also, MISRA 8.13 is violated by an inappropriate declaration, not by merely calling a function with the address of a temporary (calling with &(uint8_t){0} is a call-site issue, not the declaration). To determine a real violation you must inspect the callee\u2019s declaration (e.g. lfs_file_write_ or lfs_file_truncate_) and its implementation to see whether the pointed-to object is modified. Based on the code shown, there is no evidence that lfs_file_truncate itself violates Rule 8.13."
