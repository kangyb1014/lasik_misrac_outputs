  "explanation": "To decide if lfs_getattr violates the MISRA rule on const-qualified pointers you must know whether any pointer parameters (notably lfs, path, buffer) could or should be const. The following symbols are required: \n\n- lfs_getattr_: its prototype and implementation determine whether 'buffer' or 'lfs' are passed to lower-level calls that write through them (i.e. whether they are modified). If lfs_getattr_ treats them as output or mutates lfs state, they cannot be const.\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_id, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_tag_size, lfs_min: these are callees of lfs_getattr_. You need their prototypes/implementations to see whether any of them write through pointers passed from lfs_getattr_ (e.g. take non-const pointers or perform stores). That determines whether buffer (or other pointers) must be non-const.\n- lfs_t: the type definition (including the cfg member) is needed to know whether lfs could be const-qualified. If LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK or called functions require non-const access to lfs or its cfg, lfs cannot be const.\n- lfs_ssize_t, lfs_size_t: typedefs are needed to understand return/parameter types and whether any implicit casts affect pointer constness decisions.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: macro/function definitions are required to know what they take and whether they mutate lfs or its cfg (they may require non-const pointers), which affects whether lfs can be const-qualified.\n- LFS_TRACE: its macro signature is useful to ensure argument passing does not force removal of const (usually not relevant, but included for completeness).\n\nCollecting these symbols (prototypes/definitions) lets the analyzer determine whether pointers are written to or passed to non-const parameters, and therefore whether const qualification could or should be applied without violating program semantics."
