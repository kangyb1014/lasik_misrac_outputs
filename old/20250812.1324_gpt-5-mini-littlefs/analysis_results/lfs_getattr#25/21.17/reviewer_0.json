  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following lfs_getattr code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of lfs_getattr.\n```c\nlfs_ssize_t lfs_getattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_getattr(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %\"PRIu8\", %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    lfs_ssize_t res = lfs_getattr_(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_getattr -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The call strcspn(name, \"/\") can read bytes up to the terminating NUL. lfs_dir_find does not check that the incoming path pointer is non-NULL or that the string is NUL-terminated within a bounded buffer. Therefore if a caller passes a NULL pointer or a char buffer that is not NUL-terminated (for example: char buf[4] = {'a','b','c','d'} passed as path), strcspn will scan past the buffer and access memory beyond the object, violating Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void lfs_log_probe_before(const void *lfs, const char *path,\n        unsigned type, void *buffer, unsigned long long size) {\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/207.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f) {\n        return;\n    }\n    fprintf(f, \"[BEFORE] lfs_getattr: lfs=%p path=%p type=%u buffer=%p size=%llu\\n\",\n            lfs, (void*)path, type, buffer, size);\n    if (path == NULL) {\n        fprintf(f, \"  path == NULL\\n\");\n    } else {\n        /* Do NOT dereference path here. Just note that it is non-NULL. */\n        fprintf(f, \"  path != NULL (not dereferenced here)\\n\");\n    }\n    fflush(f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\nstatic void lfs_log_probe_after(const void *lfs, const char *path,\n        unsigned type, void *buffer, unsigned long long size, long res) {\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/207.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f) {\n        return;\n    }\n    fprintf(f, \"[AFTER]  lfs_getattr: lfs=%p path=%p type=%u buffer=%p size=%llu -> res=%ld\\n\",\n            lfs, (void*)path, type, buffer, size, res);\n    if (res < 0) {\n        fprintf(f, \"  result indicates error (res=%ld)\\n\", res);\n    }\n    fflush(f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nlfs_ssize_t lfs_getattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_getattr(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %\"PRIu8\", %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    /* Probe before delegating to implementation.

  "explanation": "The claim is not proven by the code shown. The lfs_getattr wrapper itself contains no calls to <string.h> functions such as strcspn; it simply delegates to lfs_getattr_(). Agent A\u2019s scenario hinges on lfs_getattr_ (and/or lfs_dir_find) calling strcspn(name, \"/\") without first validating that the incoming path pointer is non-NULL and that the string is NUL-terminated within its object bounds. Those called functions are not present in the supplied code, so you cannot conclude a MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 violation from the wrapper alone \u2014 the potential violation would be in lfs_getattr_ / lfs_dir_find if they indeed call strcspn (or other <string.h> functions) unsafely.\n\nNote also: the wrapper uses LFS_TRACE with \"%s\" to print path. That will attempt to read a NUL-terminated string and is UB if path is NULL or not NUL-terminated; this is a separate risk (not Rule 21.17 specifically) and should be guarded or avoided in logging. To determine whether Rule 21.17 is actually violated you must inspect the implementations of lfs_getattr_ and lfs_dir_find to see whether they call string.h functions and whether they ensure path != NULL and that the string is NUL-terminated within the referenced object bounds. Without that inspection the report is speculative."
