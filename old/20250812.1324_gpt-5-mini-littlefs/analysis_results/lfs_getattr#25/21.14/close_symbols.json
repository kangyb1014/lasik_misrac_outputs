  "explanation": "- lfs_getattr_: direct callee of lfs_getattr; its implementation must be inspected for any use of memcmp (or string comparisons done via memcmp) on the path/name arguments.\n- lfs_dir_find: reachable from lfs_getattr_; directory lookup routines commonly compare directory entry names to the supplied path \u2014 must be checked for memcmp usage on null\u2011terminated strings.\n- lfs_tag_id: used by lfs_getattr_ and related directory/tag handling; may participate in comparisons or tag parsing that use memcmp.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: fetches directory entries/blocks; may perform name comparisons after fetching \u2014 inspect for memcmp on C strings.\n- lfs_dir_get: higher\u2011level directory access called by lfs_getattr_ chain; inspect for any comparisons implemented with memcmp.\n- lfs_min: utility used by the call chain (size calculations). Include to be sure length/size semantics are not masking a memcmp-on-string use (less likely, but in the reachable set).\n- lfs_tag_size: computes tag sizes/lengths used by name comparisons; include to confirm whether lengths used with memcmp refer to null\u2011terminated strings or explicit lengths.\n- memcmp: the standard library function the MISRA rule targets \u2014 its definition/usages must be found to determine whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings in any of the above functions.\n\nInclude the full implementations (or call sites) of these symbols to determine whether any call to memcmp is being passed pointers to null\u2011terminated strings (instead of explicit lengths or safer string comparison functions), which would violate the MISRA rule."
