  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided fragments. The constructs present are standard C features: the variadic macro (__VA_ARGS__) is a C99 standard feature, the comma operator in the LFS_LOCK macro is standard, casts (void*) are standard, the assert macro is standard, and nested/forward-declared struct tags are standard C. There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __extension__, typeof, asm, statement expressions, zero-length arrays, anonymous unions (if not enabled), or other vendor-specific tokens. The '...' lines in the additional code appear to be elisions in the excerpt rather than actual code. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions detected)."
