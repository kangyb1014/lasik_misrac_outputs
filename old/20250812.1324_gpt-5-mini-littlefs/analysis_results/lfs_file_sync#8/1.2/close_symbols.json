  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_sync uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the macros, involved types, and called-function declarations/definitions that appear (or are invoked via macros/casts) in the function body:\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros (or inline functions). Macros often hide statement-expressions ({ ... }), GCC typeof, inline asm, or attributes. Inspecting their definitions is needed to detect any extension use.\n- LFS_TRACE: Typically a variadic macro or function-like macro. Its definition may use non-standard preprocessor extensions or attributes; check for __attribute__, asm, or statement-expression usage.\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macros commonly use do { } while (0) (standard) but may also use extensions (e.g., statement-expressions). Need its definition.\n- lfs_t: The structure type of the first parameter \u2014 its definition reveals the member types and any attributes (e.g., __attribute__ or bitfields) that could be language extensions.\n- lfs_file_t: The file handle type \u2014 its definition may be a typedef to a struct/union that uses extensions.\n- struct lfs_mlist: The function casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*). Inspecting this struct ensures the cast is to a standard type and that the struct does not contain extension constructs (flexible array members, compiler attributes, etc.).\n- struct lfs_config (type of lfs->cfg): lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; the config type definition may contain macros or attributes used by those macros, or use compiler-specific fields.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (prototype): Its declaration shows whether any nonstandard calling conventions, attributes, or compiler extensions are used in the function prototype.\n- lfs_file_sync_ (declaration / definition): The callee's declaration/definition may carry attributes or use extension constructs; also macros wrapping its call could expand to extension constructs. To be certain the call site and declaration are extension-free you must inspect its definition.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their headers/definitions) lets the next analyst check for explicit compiler extensions (e.g., GCC/Clang __attribute__ annotations, asm, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, builtin extensions) that would violate the MISRA rule."
