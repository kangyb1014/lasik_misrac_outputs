  "explanation": "- lfs_dir_read_: The target just forwards to this helper. You must see its parameter types (are they const-qualified?) and its body to know whether it writes through the pointer parameters (so they must not be const).\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Called (via lfs_dir_read_) and may modify the directory state or data pointed to by lfs_dir_t or lfs_t; its prototype and body are required to determine whether pointed-to objects are modified and thus whether pointers could be const.\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: Called (via lfs_dir_read_) and likely fills struct lfs_info; its prototype/body are needed to see whether it writes into the info pointer (prohibiting const) or only reads from it.\n- definition of lfs_t: Needed to know whether fields accessed through lfs (e.g. lfs->cfg) are modified and whether pointers to lfs_t could be const; also to determine the type of cfg.\n- definition of lfs_dir_t: Required to determine whether data reachable from the dir pointer is modified by any callees and thus whether dir could be a pointer-to-const.\n- definition of struct lfs_info: Required to know whether info is an output buffer (written by callees) or only read; if written, it cannot be const.\n- definition/type of lfs->cfg: lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; need its type to check whether those lock functions require a mutable pointer or could accept a const pointer.\n- LFS_LOCK macro/function: Its prototype/definition shows whether it takes a const pointer (allowing cfg to be const) or requires mutable access; also reveals any casts that might hide const-qualification violations.\n- LFS_UNLOCK macro/function: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 to determine whether passing lfs->cfg respects const-correctness.\n\nCollecting these symbols (prototypes and implementations where possible) lets a reviewer determine whether any of the pointer parameters or uses in lfs_dir_read should be const-qualified without false positives caused by downstream modifications."
