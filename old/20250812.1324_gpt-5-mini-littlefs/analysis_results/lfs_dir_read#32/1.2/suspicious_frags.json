  "explanation": "All other code constructs in the provided snippets are standard C constructs and not obvious compiler-specific extensions: the use of casts (e.g. (void*)lfs), the comma operator in the macro definition #define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0), the cast-to-void expression in #define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg), the function definition and return/lock-unlock pattern are standard C and do not require compiler extensions. Therefore they do not need investigation for Rule 1.2. The only constructs that warrant further inspection are the variadic tracing macro definition/usage shown above, which may rely on compiler-specific preprocessor behavior (notably the use of __VA_ARGS__ in the macro definition and invocation) depending on the compiler and language-standard mode; those fragments are reported for investigation."
