  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to the parameter identifiers lfs, dir, or info (no statements like lfs = ..., dir = ..., or info = ...), nor any increments/decrements on them.\n- Accesses such as lfs->cfg (in LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK) modify the object pointed to by lfs (which is permitted by the rule); they do not modify the pointer parameter itself.\n- The LFS_TRACE invocations only pass the parameters as values (casts to void*) and do not alter the parameter variables.\n- The call err = lfs_dir_read_(lfs, dir, info); assigns to the local variable err and passes the parameters by value; the callee may modify the objects pointed to, but that does not constitute modification of this function\u2019s parameter variables.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
