  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: both lfs and file are non-const pointers and the code merely casts them to void* for logging. Rule 8.13 concerns using const-qualified pointed-to types where possible; this cast does not remove a const qualifier from an existing pointer. A violation would occur if a const-qualified pointer were cast to (void*) (thereby discarding const). Example violating scenario: casting a const lfs_file_t *file to (void*)file for logging (this removes const and would breach Rule 8.13)."
