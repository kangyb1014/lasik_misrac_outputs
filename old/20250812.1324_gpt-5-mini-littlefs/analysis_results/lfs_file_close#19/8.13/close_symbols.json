  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer in lfs_file_close should be const-qualified you must know what those pointers point to and whether called functions mutate the pointed objects:  \n- lfs_t (type definition): shows the type of the first parameter and the type of members (notably cfg and mlist). Needed to determine whether members are mutable and whether pointers to lfs_t could/should be const.  \n- lfs_file_t (type definition): shows the concrete file structure; needed to know whether lfs_file_close or callees modify the file contents, which determines if lfs_file_t * could be const.  \n- struct lfs_mlist (type definition): lfs_mlist_isopen is called with a cast to struct lfs_mlist*, so you must see the actual list element type and its relation to lfs_file_t to judge correct const qualification.  \n- lfs_mlist_isopen (prototype/definition): its parameter types (const vs non-const) and whether it mutates the list element determine whether passing (struct lfs_mlist*)file is safe and whether its parameter should be const.  \n- lfs_file_close_ (prototype/definition and body): lfs_file_close delegates work to this function; inspect whether it modifies lfs or file (and how it passes them to other functions) to decide if original pointers could be const.  \n- lfs_file_sync_ (prototype/definition and body): called (according to the call graph) by lfs_file_close_; if it mutates the file or lfs state, that prevents making parameters const.  \n- lfs_mlist_remove (prototype/definition and body): used by lfs_file_close_ to remove the file from the list; if it modifies the list node or takes a non-const pointer, that affects const qualification of the passed pointer.  \n- lfs_free (prototype/definition): if lfs_file_close_ calls lfs_free on the file pointer (or embedded members), that is a mutating/destructive operation implying the pointer cannot be const.  \n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macro or inline definitions): these use lfs->cfg; knowing the type and whether the lock functions accept a const pointer determines whether lfs->cfg should be a const-qualified pointer in lfs_t.  \n\nCollecting these symbols lets you see where pointers are read-only vs written/freed and therefore whether they can/should be declared with const to satisfy the MISRA rule."
