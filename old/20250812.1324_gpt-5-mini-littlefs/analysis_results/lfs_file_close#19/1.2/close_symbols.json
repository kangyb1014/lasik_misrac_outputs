  "explanation": "You must inspect the listed symbols to determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule check). Brief reasons: \n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macros): macros commonly expand to non-standard constructs (GCC statement-expressions ({...}), __attribute__, inline asm, typeof, or other compiler-specific builtins). The call in the target uses these macros, so their definitions are needed to detect any extensions. \n- LFS_TRACE (macro): tracing macros are often variadic or implemented with compiler-specific extensions (variadic macros are standard C99 but implementations may use GNU extensions like %<...> or statement-expressions); inspect its definition for extensions. \n- LFS_ASSERT (macro): assertion macros may expand to compiler-specific annotations or use extensions (e.g., __builtin_expect, attributes, anonymous structs). Needed to detect extension usage in the assert expansion and the cast to (struct lfs_mlist*). \n- typedef/struct definition of lfs_t (including cfg member type): the code accesses lfs->cfg and passes it to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK. The type definition may use language extensions (anonymous unions/structs, compiler attributes on members, bit-field extensions) that must be checked. \n- typedef/struct definition of lfs_file_t: the function takes this type and casts it to struct lfs_mlist* in the assert; its definition may include extensions (anonymous members, flexible array usage, attributes). \n- struct lfs_mlist definition (tag and layout): the code casts to (struct lfs_mlist*); the struct definition might itself use language extensions (anonymous unions/structs, bit-field widths with extension, attributes). \n- declaration/definition of lfs_mlist_isopen: the prototype or definition might contain compiler-specific attributes, inline/asm, or parameter type extensions; the call site uses it inside a macro (LFS_ASSERT), so its declaration must be checked. \n- declaration/definition of lfs_file_close_: the function is invoked by the target; its prototype/definition may use function attributes or other extensions (e.g., __attribute__((...)), inline asm, nonstandard calling conventions) that would mean the target directly depends on language extensions.\n\nOnly these symbols are required to determine whether the target function itself (including the macros and immediate types it uses) employs compiler language extensions. Inspecting their definitions/declarations will reveal uses of statement expressions, typeof, __attribute__, asm, anonymous/unnamed struct/union features, or other documented compiler extensions."
