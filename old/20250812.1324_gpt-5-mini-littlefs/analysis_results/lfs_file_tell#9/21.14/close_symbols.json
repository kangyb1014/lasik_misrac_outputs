  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_tell (or anything it invokes) uses the C library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect the implementations (or macro expansions) of all direct callees and any macros used inside lfs_file_tell: \n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called directly from lfs_file_tell via LFS_ASSERT; it may contain uses of memcmp comparing strings (e.g. name checks), so its body must be inspected.\n- lfs_file_tell_: The function returns the value used by lfs_file_tell; it may perform checks or string comparisons (via memcmp) that would violate the rule.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros or inline functions invoked before/after the call; their expansions might contain memcmp usage (unlikely but possible), so they must be reviewed.\n- LFS_ASSERT: This macro wraps the call to lfs_mlist_isopen; its expansion could itself use memcmp or perform string comparisons when building messages or conditions.\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing/logging macros can expand to code that formats or compares strings; inspect them to ensure they don't call memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their source or macro expansions) is sufficient to determine whether any memcmp usage that compares null-terminated strings is reachable from lfs_file_tell."
