  "explanation": "I inspected the given code and related definitions for any assignments or modifications to function parameters (which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8). Reasons why no fragments need investigation:\n\n- lfs_file_tell(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file): No assignment to lfs or file. Macros LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and LFS_TRACE expand to ((void)cfg,0)/((void)cfg) or nothing, so they do not modify the parameters. The function only calls lfs_file_tell_ and returns its result.\n\n- lfs_file_tell_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file): The function explicitly discards lfs ((void)lfs) and returns file->pos. It does not assign to lfs or file; reading file->pos (the object pointed to) is permitted by the rule.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head, struct lfs_mlist *node): Although the function takes &head to initialize a local pointer-to-pointer (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head) and then walks the list via p = &(*p)->next, it never assigns to the parameter variable head itself. All mutations are to the local variable p (and reads of *p); no function parameter is modified.\n\n- Macros and casts used (e.g., (struct lfs_mlist*)file) only pass pointers by value and do not modify the parameter variables.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that modify function parameters and that would violate Rule 17.8."
