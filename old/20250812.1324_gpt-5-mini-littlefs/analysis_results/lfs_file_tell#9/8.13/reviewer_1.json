Casting to a non-const pointer (or using a function that takes a non-const pointer) prevents using a const-qualified type and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, instead, lfs_mlist_isopen legitimately modifies the object, then there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void lfs_probe_log(const char *stage, void *lfs_ptr, void *file_ptr, void *cast_ptr, int isopen)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/75.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f) {\n        return;\n    }\n    /* Log stage, raw pointers and the result of lfs_mlist_isopen (if available). */\n    fprintf(f, \"%s: lfs=%p, file=%p, file_as_mlist=%p, isopen=%d\\n\",\n            stage, lfs_ptr, file_ptr, cast_ptr, isopen);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nlfs_soff_t lfs_file_tell(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n\n    /*\n     * Probe: record that we are about to call lfs_mlist_isopen and the\n     * pointer values involved.

  "explanation": "Not enough evidence to conclude a violation. Rule 8.13 says pointer types should be const-qualified when possible, but whether a violation exists depends on the declaration and semantics of lfs_mlist_isopen. In the posted snippet we only see a cast to (struct lfs_mlist *)file; that cast by itself is not proof of an 8.13 violation because:\n\n- If lfs_mlist_isopen is declared to take struct lfs_mlist * and the function legitimately modifies the structure, then a non-const parameter is appropriate and there is no violation.\n- If lfs_mlist_isopen does not modify the object (i.e. it only inspects it), then the correct solution is to change its prototype to take const struct lfs_mlist * (or to call it with a const-qualified pointer), and then the current call-site cast would be unnecessary. Only in that latter case would the codebase be non-conforming with 8.13.\n\nThe provided test probe does not demonstrate the function signature or side-effects and the log was empty, so it does not establish that lfs_mlist_isopen is non-mutating. To determine correctness: inspect the declaration/implementation of lfs_mlist_isopen. If it can be const-qualified, update its parameter to const struct lfs_mlist * and remove the cast; otherwise no MISRA 8.13 violation is present."
