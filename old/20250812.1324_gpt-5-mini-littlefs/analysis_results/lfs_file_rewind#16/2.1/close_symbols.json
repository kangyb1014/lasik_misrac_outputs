  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is used to compute err and may contain control-flow (return, goto, longjmp, abort) in its expansion. To decide whether code after the call is reachable (or whether the early \"if (err) return err;\" is the only exit), you must inspect LFS_LOCK's definition.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: May contain control-flow or side-effects (could be a macro that never returns, or that changes program flow). Need its definition to determine whether the final unlock + return are reachable in all cases.\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros sometimes expand to nothing or to code that can affect control flow (e.g., assert/abort, or return on error). You must check its expansion to know whether the subsequent statements (call to lfs_file_rewind_ or the final unlock/return) can be unreachable.\n- lfs_file_rewind_: The function called from this function may not return (infinite loop, longjmp, abort) or may alter control flow in unexpected ways. Its body is required to determine whether any code after the call (trace/unlock/return) is unreachable.\n- lfs_t and lfs_file_t: Types of the arguments (and in particular the lfs->cfg member used by LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK) are needed to understand how the lock/unlock macros operate and whether accessing those members can have side-effects that affect control flow.\n\nThese symbols together are sufficient to determine whether any statements in lfs_file_rewind are provably unreachable under the code expansions and called-function behaviours (the core question for MISRA\u2019s unreachable-code rule)."
