  "explanation": "- lfs_t (type definition): needed to know the types and const-qualification of its members (in particular whether lfs->cfg is a pointer to const or non-const) and whether any fields are modified by downstream calls, which affects whether the lfs parameter itself could be qualified const.\n- lfs_file_t (type definition): required to determine whether the function (or any callee) writes through the file pointer's fields and thus whether the file parameter could be declared as a pointer-to-const.\n- type of lfs->cfg (configuration object type and definition): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg; the constness of that member and whether these operations mutate/require non-const config determines if lfs (which contains cfg) can be const.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function declaration/definition): must inspect its signature/implementation to see if it takes a const pointer or performs modifications or casts away const, which directly affects whether lfs->cfg (and therefore lfs) can be const.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function declaration/definition): same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its prototype/behavior can require non-const access to lfs->cfg.\n- lfs_file_rewind_ (prototype and implementation): the target forwards its parameters to this function; to decide if lfs/file could be const we must see whether lfs_file_rewind_ modifies either object or calls non-const APIs that require mutation.\n- lfs_file_seek_ (prototype and implementation): static call graph shows lfs_file_rewind_ calls lfs_file_seek_; that callee may perform writes or require non-const arguments, so its signature/implementation is needed to determine const-qualification transitively.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/definition): although typically non-mutating, tracing macros may perform casts or use non-const prototypes; inspect its definition to ensure it does not cast away const or otherwise require non-const pointers.\n\nProvide these symbols (declarations and implementations where applicable) so the next analyzer can determine whether any of the pointers passed into lfs_file_rewind must remain non-const or could be const-qualified per the MISRA rule."
