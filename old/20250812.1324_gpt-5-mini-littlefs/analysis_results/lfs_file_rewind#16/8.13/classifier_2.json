  "scenario": "Cannot determine from this single call. The fragment LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg); only shows a use of the pointer, not its declaration or the prototype of LFS_UNLOCK. Rule 8.13 is about pointer declarations/parameters being const-qualified when they do not modify the pointed-to object. A violation would occur if both of the following were true: (1) lfs_t contains a member declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. struct lfs_config *cfg;) and (2) the LFS_UNLOCK macro/function takes a non-const pointer parameter (e.g. void LFS_UNLOCK(struct lfs_config *cfg)) even though neither the member nor the function modify the pointed-to configuration. In that case the member and the function parameter should be declared as pointer-to-const (e.g. const struct lfs_config *cfg and void LFS_UNLOCK(const struct lfs_config *cfg)) to conform to Rule 8.13."
