  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Based on the fragment alone this is not a violation: lfs_file_rewind_ is expected to modify the file object's state (resetting offsets, etc.), so passing a non-const lfs_file_t * is appropriate. This call would only violate Rule 8.13 if lfs_file_rewind_ actually treats its pointer parameters as read\u2011only (i.e. does not modify through them) \u2014 in that case the function prototype should have used const-qualified pointer types and the call (and prototype) would violate the rule."
