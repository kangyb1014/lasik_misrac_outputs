  "explanation": "- lfs_file_rewind_: The target function simply forwards work to this internal implementation. To determine whether the public wrapper violates the MISRA rule you must inspect the body of lfs_file_rewind_ for any uses of memcmp (or for calls that pass C strings to other functions that use memcmp).\n- lfs_file_seek_: The static call graph shows lfs_file_rewind_ calls lfs_file_seek_. Any memcmp usage (or string comparisons using memcmp) may be in lfs_file_seek_ rather than in lfs_file_rewind_, so its implementation must be examined.\n- memcmp: This is the Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule. You must find all call sites of memcmp in the reachable code and examine the arguments (the pointer operands and the size argument) to decide whether memcmp is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings rather than raw byte buffers."
