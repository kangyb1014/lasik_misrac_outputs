  "explanation": "I inspected all provided code fragments (lfs_file_rewind, lfs_file_rewind_, and lfs_file_seek_). None of these fragments contain any call to the Standard Library function memcmp, nor do they perform comparisons of null-terminated strings (there are only integer/offset comparisons, bitwise flag checks, and calls to other functions like lfs_file_flush, lfs_file_seek_, and lfs_file_size_). Therefore there are no uses of memcmp in the supplied code to be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If you want investigation of other files or implementations of the called functions (e.g., lfs_file_flush, lfs_file_size_, or any other modules), provide those code fragments so I can check for memcmp usage there."
