  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The target calls this macro/function. Its definition may use compiler extensions (e.g., statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, inline assembly, or non\u2011standard builtins). You must inspect its definition to decide if the call in the target uses a language extension.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2013 the unlock macro/function may hide compiler-specific extensions; its expansion must be checked.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is invoked with printf-style arguments. Its definition may use variadic macros, token\u2011pasting, GCC statement expressions, attributes, or other compiler-specific constructs, so its source is required.\n- lfs_file_rewind_: The target directly calls this helper. Its prototype or definition may carry compiler extensions (function attributes, inline asm, non\u2011standard calling conventions) that affect whether the target uses language extensions.\n- struct lfs_t: The function dereferences lfs and accesses lfs->cfg. The struct definition may contain anonymous/implementation\u2011defined features, compiler attributes, or other extensions (anonymous unions/structs, non\u2011standard bitfields) that must be inspected.\n- struct lfs_file_t: The file parameter type should be checked for non\u2011standard declarations or attributes attached to the type that would constitute language extensions.\n- lfs_t->cfg (cfg member/type): The cfg member passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK may expand to code that relies on the member type or uses extension-specific constructs (e.g., typeof(cfg), macro overloading). Its declaration/type is needed to fully analyze the macros and any hidden extensions.\n\nCollecting these definitions lets the next analyzer determine whether any macros, types, or called functions introduce compiler-specific language extensions used by the target function."
