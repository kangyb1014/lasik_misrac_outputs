  "explanation": "Rule 1.2 forbids use of language extensions. The code uses casts and macros. The following fragments do NOT need investigation for Rule 1.2: the function lfs_file_rewind definition and its overall structure, the call to lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file), the helper function lfs_file_rewind_ implementation and standard return of int, and the typedefs and struct definitions (lfs_t, lfs_file_t) \u2014 these are standard C constructs, not compiler-specific extensions. The suspicious fragments reported are those that may rely on extension-like behavior: use of variadic macro LFS_TRACE (implementation shown as empty, but variadic macros are standard since C99 \u2014 still report since some compilers may treat as extension), usage of (void*) casts in variadic-formatted pointer arguments, and the use of the comma operator in the LFS_LOCK macro ((void)cfg,0) which is standard C but sometimes used as extension pattern; these macros should be checked against compiler documentation to ensure they are not relying on nonstandard compiler-specific features. If none of these macros or casts are documented as compiler extensions for the target compiler, then there is no Rule 1.2 violation."
