  "explanation": "To decide if lfs_fs_grow (via its callees) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must inspect any function that could call memcmp or pass string/byte buffers to it. Specifically:\n- lfs_fs_grow_: direct callee from lfs_fs_grow; its body must be inspected for memcmp usage or for calls that forward name/buffer arguments.\n- lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_commit: these directory-related routines are listed as callees of lfs_fs_grow_ and are the most likely places where name comparisons occur. You need their implementations to see whether they call memcmp (directly or indirectly) and what buffers they compare.\n- lfs_superblock_fromle32, lfs_superblock_tole32: listed callees of lfs_fs_grow_. While they are less likely to use memcmp for string compares, their bodies should be checked to be comprehensive.\n- memcmp: include the standard function (or any local wrapper) to identify its use sites and confirm the parameter intent (are the compared buffers null\u2011terminated C strings or fixed\u2011length binary fields?).\n- on\u2011disk directory entry / name buffer definitions: to determine whether a buffer passed to memcmp is a null\u2011terminated C string or a fixed-size, possibly non\u2011terminated byte array you must inspect the struct(s) that hold file/directory names and how names are stored on disk.\n- name length / termination macros (e.g. LFS_NAME_MAX or similar): constants and macros that define name buffer sizes or termination rules are required to decide if comparisons involve null termination.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyzer find every memcmp call in the relevant call chain and determine the nature (null\u2011terminated string vs fixed\u2011length byte buffer) of the buffers being compared."
