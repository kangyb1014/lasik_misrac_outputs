  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and const qualification. The suspicious fragments selected cover all pointer-related uses in the provided snippet: the non-const pointer parameter in the function signature, the uses of lfs (including an explicit cast to (void*) in the trace), the passing of lfs to the helper function, and the lfs->cfg expressions used with lock/unlock. Other parts of the code are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and therefore were not selected: local scalar variables (err, block_count) are not pointers; format string literals and the PRIu32 macro are not pointer types; the trace call that only logs err does not involve pointers; return statements and integer error handling are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. No other pointer expressions appear in the snippet, so there are no additional fragments to investigate for this rule."
