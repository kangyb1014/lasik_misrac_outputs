  "scenario": "Not violated: the parameter lfs is used with LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK (accessing lfs->cfg) and is forwarded to lfs_fs_grow_, which by name and usage likely modifies the filesystem state. Because the function (and the called helpers) are expected to modify the object referred to by lfs, the pointer must not be const. If, instead, lfs were truly not modified anywhere, then the parameter should be declared const lfs_t *lfs to satisfy Rule 8.13."
