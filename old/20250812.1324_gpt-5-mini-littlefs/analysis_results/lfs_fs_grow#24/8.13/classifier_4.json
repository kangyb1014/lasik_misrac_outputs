  "scenario": "Not violated: lfs->cfg is being passed to LFS_LOCK, which is a locking operation that presumably requires mutable access to the lock/config object. Rule 8.13 would only be violated if the object does not need to be modified and could have been declared const but was not. With the given fragment there is no evidence that lfs->cfg could be const, so this use does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
