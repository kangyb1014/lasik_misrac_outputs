  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_fs_grow violates the MISRA rule (pointers should point to const whenever possible) we must know whether the lfs pointer (and any pointers reachable from it) can legitimately be const. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- struct lfs_t (definition): shows the type of the parameter lfs and its members (including cfg). Needed to know whether members are mutable or pointer types that would prevent making the lfs parameter const.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg struct / typedef): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg; we must know the cfg type and whether those lock functions require a non-const pointer (which would forbid a const lfs parameter) or can accept const.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function prototype/definition): called at function entry with lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK takes a non-const pointer or performs modifications, lfs cannot be const. Also needed to check whether the macro expands to casts that drop qualifiers.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function prototype/definition): same reasoning as LFS_LOCK for the matching unlock call.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition): lfs is passed (void*)lfs to LFS_TRACE. If the trace macro forces a cast that strips const (e.g., casts to void*), then making lfs const would cause qualifier discarding or require changes to the trace macro. We must inspect its definition to see whether it would prevent a const parameter.\n\n- lfs_fs_grow_ (function definition): lfs_fs_grow simply forwards to lfs_fs_grow_. To determine if lfs can be const we must examine lfs_fs_grow_ to see whether it modifies the FS state or passes lfs to callees that require non-const pointers.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_commit (prototypes/definitions): these are callees of lfs_fs_grow_. Their parameter lists determine whether they accept const lfs_t* or require non-const pointers or modify structures reachable from lfs. If any require non-const, lfs cannot be const.\n\n- lfs_superblock_fromle32, lfs_superblock_tole32 (prototypes/definitions): these are also called by lfs_fs_grow_. Their signatures show whether they accept/modify pointers that would force non-const usage (for example, writing into buffers passed by pointer).\n\nCollecting those definitions/signatures lets the next analyst determine whether any use in lfs_fs_grow (direct or through lfs_fs_grow_) requires modifying the pointed-to object or passing non-const pointers, or whether qualifier-stripping casts (e.g. in LFS_TRACE) would create MISRA violations if lfs were made const."
