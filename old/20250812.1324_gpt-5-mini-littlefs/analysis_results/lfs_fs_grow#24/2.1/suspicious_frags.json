  "explanation": "Other parts of the function and the additional code do not show statically unreachable code and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in this snippet: - Calls and returns inside lfs_fs_grow_ (for example the early return when block_count == lfs->block_count, the multiple error checks and returns, and the final return) are conditional on runtime values and thus not provably unreachable from the source shown. - The conditional compilation blocks (#ifdef / #ifndef LFS_SHRINKNONRELOCATING) produce code that may or may not be present depending on build configuration; reachability of those blocks cannot be decided from the provided snapshot and so they should be evaluated in the build context rather than flagged here. - LFS_TRACE and LFS_UNLOCK macros (as shown) expand to no-ops and do not introduce unreachable branches in the surrounding code. Therefore they are not included as suspicious fragments to investigate further."
