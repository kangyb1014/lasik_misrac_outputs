  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for unreachable code in lfs_fs_grow:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is used to initialise err. LFS_LOCK may be a macro or function that can contain branching, return statements, longjmp, or attributes (e.g. noreturn). You must see its definition/expansion to determine if the assignment/if-return sequence can be bypassed or if LFS_LOCK itself makes later code unreachable.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Present after the call to lfs_fs_grow_. If a callee or macro is noreturn, the LFS_UNLOCK call (and subsequent return) could be unreachable. You need the definition/expansion to determine whether the unlock call itself has control-flow effects (or could be removed by macro expansion) that change reachability.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Appears twice around the call. Trace macros often expand to code (possibly with conditional compilation) that could include control-flow effects (e.g. return, abort, longjmp) or vanish entirely. Its expansion is required to know whether the trace calls introduce or remove reachable code paths.\n\n- lfs_fs_grow_: The callee is the critical symbol: if it is declared/defined with attributes such as noreturn or if its body contains infinite loops, longjmp, exits, or other non-returning behavior then any statements after the call (the second LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK, return) may be unreachable. You must inspect its prototype/definition and attributes.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition, including cfg field): The macros above take lfs or lfs->cfg as arguments. The cfg type and lfs_t layout can affect macro expansion (e.g. if macros dereference fields or use inline functions), so the type definitions are necessary to expand/understand the macros and any conditional behavior they implement.\n\n- lfs_size_t (typedef): Included to fully resolve the function signature and any macro expansions involving block_count (not usually control-flow affecting, but required to parse expansions that reference the type).\n\n- PRIu32 (format macro): Appears in the LFS_TRACE format string. Its definition/expansion is usually harmless, but is needed to fully expand any format-related macros if LFS_TRACE builds format strings via macros. (This is low priority but inexpensive to include.)\n\nIn short: to determine whether any statements in lfs_fs_grow are guaranteed never to execute, you must expand/inspect all macros and the callee's declaration/definition and the involved types so the analyzer can see any noreturn/exit/longjmp/return/infinite-loop behavior that would make code unreachable."
