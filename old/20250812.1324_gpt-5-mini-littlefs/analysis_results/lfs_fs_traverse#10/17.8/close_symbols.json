  "explanation": "You must inspect macro/function definitions and the lfs type to be sure the formal parameters of lfs_fs_traverse are not being assigned to (which would violate the MISRA rule).\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked with lfs->cfg. LFS_LOCK is likely a macro and could expand to code that assigns to or rebinds its argument or to the identifier used in the call site (e.g. via unusual macro expansion). Verify its expansion does not perform any assignment to the formal parameter 'lfs' or otherwise rebind/modify that parameter variable.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK for the matching unlock macro \u2014 inspect its expansion to ensure it does not assign to the function parameters (lfs, cb, data).\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is called with the parameters (including a cast of cb and the data pointer). Macros can contain side effects; check its definition to ensure it only reads those arguments and does not perform any assignment to the caller's formal parameters (for example via token pasting, unusual macro tricks, or by using argument names that could conflict).\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: Although callees cannot directly assign to the caller's formal parameter variables, include this symbol to confirm it is not a macro or inline expansion that would replace code inside lfs_fs_traverse (which could then modify the formal parameters). If it is a plain function, it cannot reassign the caller's formal parameters; if it is a macro/inline, its expansion must be inspected.\n\n- lfs_t: The definition of the lfs_t type (and specifically the cfg member) is needed to verify that accesses like lfs->cfg passed into macros cannot cause hidden rebinds/assignments via overloaded operators or weird macros. Also ensures that 'lfs' is indeed a pointer formal parameter (and not a macro-expanded identifier) so that assignments to it would be detectable.\n\nNote: Standard types like uintptr_t or lfs_block_t do not need separate inspection for this MISRA rule because casts and passing-by-value do not reassign the function's formal parameter variables; the primary risk is from macro expansions or inline replacements that could assign to the formal parameters."
