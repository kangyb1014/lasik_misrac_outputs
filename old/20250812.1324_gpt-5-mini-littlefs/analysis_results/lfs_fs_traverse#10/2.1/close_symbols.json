  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in lfs_fs_traverse is unreachable you must know the actual control-flow semantics of the macros and functions used and the type of lfs->cfg passed to the lock macros:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The early return (if (err) return err;) depends entirely on what LFS_LOCK expands to/returns. If LFS_LOCK is a macro or function that never returns a non-zero value, or if it contains control-flow that forces a return/longjmp/abort, then different parts of lfs_fs_traverse become unreachable. You must inspect its definition.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: This is executed unconditionally before the final return. If LFS_UNLOCK can alter control flow (e.g. contain a longjmp, exit, or a return in certain builds) then the final \"return err;\" could be unreachable. Its definition is required to decide reachability.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Although normally a logging macro, LFS_TRACE could be defined to contain conditional compilation, branching, or even control-flow-altering constructs in some builds. You must check its expansion to ensure it does not make any subsequent statements unreachable.\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: The call to this helper is the main work of the function. If lfs_fs_traverse_ can perform non-local control transfers (longjmp, exit) or modify the value of err in a way that affects later flow, that affects reachability of code after the call. Its implementation is required to reason about post-call reachability.\n\n- struct lfs_t: The type (and specifically the type of lfs->cfg) is required to understand what is passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK (e.g. whether cfg is a pointer to a structure that affects macro overloads or inlines) and to fully resolve macro expansions that depend on the cfg type.\n\nTogether these symbols provide the necessary definitions to decide whether any statement in lfs_fs_traverse can never be reached under any build/configuration (MISRA unreachable-code analysis)."
