  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C 'pointer to const where possible' for lfs_fs_traverse we must know whether the function or any callees modify the objects pointed-to by its pointer parameters (lfs, the callback parameter, and data) or require non-const pointers. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: The immediate callee. Must inspect its prototype and implementation to see how it uses/modifies the lfs pointer, how it invokes the callback 'cb', and how it passes 'data' onward. If lfs_fs_traverse_ mutates lfs or passes non-const pointers to other routines, lfs_fs_traverse cannot make the parameter const.\n\n- lfs_ctz_traverse: Appears in lfs_fs_traverse_'s callee list and is a likely place where traversal invokes the callback. Need its prototype/implementation to see how it calls cb and whether it uses/changes the void* data (i.e., whether the callback is expected to receive a modifiable pointer).\n\n- lfs_tag_type3, lfs_ctz_fromle32, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_tortoise_detectcycles, lfs_pair_isnull: These are callees (direct or indirect) of lfs_fs_traverse_. Any of them may accept pointers derived from lfs, from the 'data' argument, or from buffers that would impose non-const requirements. Their signatures/implementations determine whether non-const pointers are required by the traversal code.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition): Required to determine whether lfs_fs_traverse or its callees write into the structure pointed to by 'lfs' (i.e., whether lfs can be const lfs_t *). Also required to locate the 'cfg' member type.\n\n- lfs_block_t (typedef): The callback returns/int takes lfs_block_t; the exact type is needed to confirm callback semantics and to inspect callback callsites for const correctness.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/function) and LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function): lfs_fs_traverse calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg). Their prototypes/definitions show whether they require a mutable cfg pointer (thereby preventing making lfs or lfs->cfg const) and whether locking implies modification of configuration object.\n\n- lfs->cfg (configuration object type): The concrete type of cfg (and whether the lock/unlock APIs take non-const pointers) is necessary to know if lfs->cfg must be non-const. If cfg operations mutate state, that prevents marking lfs (or cfg) as const.\n\n- lfs_alloc_scan and lfs_fs_size_: These are other callers of lfs_fs_traverse_. Inspecting them (and any callbacks they pass) is useful to see the expected callback signatures and whether callbacks rely on mutable data pointers. If callers supply callbacks that need mutable data, the function pointer type in lfs_fs_traverse cannot be changed to take 'const void *'.\n\nCollecting the above symbols (prototypes and implementations, plus type definitions) provides the necessary context to decide whether the pointers in lfs_fs_traverse can be const-qualified without breaking semantics or API contracts."
