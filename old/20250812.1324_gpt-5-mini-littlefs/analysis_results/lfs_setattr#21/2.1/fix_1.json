  "explanation": "The original code was truncated in the middle of a fprintf format string which prevented compilation. I completed the probe function by finishing the format strings, printing the uint8_t 'type' as an unsigned value (casting to unsigned), printing the buffer pointer, and printing the uint32_t 'size' using the PRIu32 macro for portability. I also ensured the file is closed with fclose. No main or macros were added and the logging behavior is preserved."
