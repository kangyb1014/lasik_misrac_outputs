  "scenario": "The single statement int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); by itself does not show a violation: there is no pointer declaration here and we cannot tell whether the pointer type is const-qualified without the declaration/prototype of lfs->cfg or the definition/prototype/macro expansion of LFS_LOCK. A concrete violation would be if LFS_LOCK (or its underlying function) is declared to take a non-const pointer even though it does not modify the object. For example, if the prototype is\n\n    int LFS_LOCK(struct lfs_config *cfg);\n\nbut LFS_LOCK does not modify *cfg, then Rule 8.13 is violated and the prototype should be changed to\n\n    int LFS_LOCK(const struct lfs_config *cfg);\n\nSimilarly, if lfs->cfg is declared as a non-const pointer but should be const, that declaration would be a violation. Without the declarations/definitions, no violation can be determined from the fragment alone."
