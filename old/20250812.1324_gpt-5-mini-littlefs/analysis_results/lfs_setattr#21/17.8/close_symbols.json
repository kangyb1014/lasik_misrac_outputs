  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked with the expression lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK is a macro (or an inline function) its expansion could contain assignments to identifiers visible in the caller scope; we must inspect its definition to ensure it does not assign to any of the function parameters (e.g. to lfs) or otherwise modify the parameter objects in a way that violates the MISRA rule.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 check its definition to ensure it does not assign to or rebind any of the target function parameters when expanded/executed.\n- LFS_TRACE: Called with (void*)lfs, path, type, buffer, size. If LFS_TRACE is a macro it expands into code in the caller scope and could (maliciously or accidentally) modify parameter variables; inspect the macro/function to ensure it only reads its arguments and does not assign to parameter names.\n- lfs_setattr_: Although shown as a callee, lfs_setattr_ might be a macro or an inline that expands into code in the caller scope and could modify caller parameters (e.g. assigns to path/type/etc.). Even if it is a regular function, verify whether its name is a macro or wrapper; include its definition to be sure the caller's parameters are not rebound/assigned by a macro expansion.\n- lfs_t (definition): The struct/type definition (and in particular the cfg field type) is needed to understand how expressions like lfs->cfg are evaluated/passed into macros, and to confirm there is no macro trickery that would require writing into the parameter variable itself. Inspecting lfs_t also helps confirm that only the pointed-to object is being accessed/modified (allowed) and that the pointer parameter itself is not reassigned."
