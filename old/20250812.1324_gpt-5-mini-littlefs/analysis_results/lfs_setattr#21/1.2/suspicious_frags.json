  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C (not compiler extensions):\n\n- Variadic macro LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \u2014 variadic macros are standard in C99.\n- Use of PRIu8 and PRIu32 format macros \u2014 these are standard inttypes.h macros (C99/C11) for printf format specifiers for exact-width integer types.\n- Casts ((void*)lfs), (void)cfg, and the comma operator in ((void)cfg,0) \u2014 all standard C.\n- Preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef LFS_MIGRATE) and macro definitions (#define) \u2014 standard.\n- Nested structs, typedefs (typedef uint32_t lfs_size_t), and the function definitions \u2014 standard C.\n\nBecause none of the code constructs are documented compiler-specific extensions (like GCC\u2019s typeof, statement expressions, inline assembler, __attribute__ annotations, or other vendor-specific keywords), there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
