  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros (or functions) used for locking. Their definitions may hide compiler-specific extensions (inline assembly, builtin atomics, __attribute__, statement-expressions, GCC/Clang token-pasting of __VA_ARGS__, etc.). You must inspect their definitions to determine whether any language extensions are used.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro likely expands to printf-like code and may use variadic-macro idioms (including the GNU \"##__VA_ARGS__\" extension), statement-expressions, or compiler-specific attributes. Its expansion must be checked for language extensions.\n- lfs_setattr_: The called helper\u2019s declaration/definition is needed to see whether it uses non\u2011standard function attributes, inline/asm, or other extensions that affect the call in lfs_setattr.\n- lfs_t: The filesystem context type. Its typedef or struct definition may include compiler-specific extensions (packed/aligned attributes, anonymous structs/unions, bit\u2011fields with non-standard widths, or other vendor attributes).\n- lfs_size_t: The size type used for the size parameter. Its typedef may be implemented via non\u2011standard types (e.g. long long under pre\u2011C99 with __extension__, or use of compiler attributes) and must be checked.\n- lfs->cfg (the cfg member type): The type of the cfg member (often a config struct or pointer typedef) may itself use extensions (attributes, inline functions as members via macros, or be a macro alias). LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK operate on this, so understanding its definition is required.\n- PRIu8 / PRIu32: These format macros normally come from <inttypes.h>, but projects sometimes redefine them. Their exact definitions must be checked to ensure they do not rely on non\u2011standard extensions.\n- uint8_t: Standard integer typedef from <stdint.h>, but it should be confirmed (or any project redefinition) to ensure no compiler extensions are used.\n\nInspecting these symbols (macro/function definitions and typedef/struct declarations) is necessary to decide whether the target function itself or any of its visible expansions uses language extensions prohibited by the MISRA rule."
