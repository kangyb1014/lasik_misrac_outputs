  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_setattr:\n```c\nint lfs_setattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_setattr(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %\"PRIu8\", %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    err = lfs_setattr_(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_setattr -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_setattr:\nstatic int lfs_setattr_(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    if (size > lfs->attr_max) {\n        return LFS_ERR_NOSPC;\n    }\n\n    return lfs_commitattr(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_commitattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    lfs_mdir_t cwd;\n    lfs_stag_t tag = lfs_dir_find(lfs, &cwd, &path, NULL);\n    if (tag < 0) {\n        return tag;\n    }\n\n    uint16_t id = lfs_tag_id(tag);\n    if (id == 0x3ff) {\n        // special case for root\n        id = 0;\n        int err = lfs_dir_fetch(lfs, &cwd, lfs->root);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return lfs_dir_commit(lfs, &cwd, LFS_MKATTRS(\n            {LFS_MKTAG(LFS_TYPE_USERATTR + type, id, size), buffer}));\n}\n...\nuint8_t type\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nLFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
