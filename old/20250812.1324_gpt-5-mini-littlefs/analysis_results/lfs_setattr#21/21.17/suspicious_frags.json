  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not invoke or pass data to standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) nor do they present pointer/size operations that could hide such calls. Specifically: the LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK macros shown are no-ops here; LFS_TRACE is defined as an empty macro in the provided code (so the trace call does not perform string operations in this build); simple typedefs and macro definitions provided (such as the lfs_size_t typedef and LFS_MKTAG macro use) do not themselves invoke string.h functions. The listed fragments were chosen because they pass path, buffer, and size into other functions or macros (lfs_setattr_, lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit/LFS_MKATTRS) which may internally call string/ memory functions and therefore must be inspected to ensure accesses remain within object bounds."
