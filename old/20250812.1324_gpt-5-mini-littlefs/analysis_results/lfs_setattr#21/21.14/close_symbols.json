  "explanation": "- lfs_setattr_: The target directly delegates to this helper. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it calls memcmp (or a wrapper) to compare attribute data or strings.\\n- lfs_commitattr: Called (transitively) by lfs_setattr_; the memcmp misuse may occur deeper in the attribute commit path, so its body must be examined.\\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets uses of the standard memcmp function. Include its declaration/usages so you can detect direct calls or macro/wrapper aliases that perform byte-wise comparison of null-terminated strings.\\n- LFS_TRACE: A macro used in the wrapper; it could hide or expand to helper code (or wrappers) that call comparison routines. Check its expansion to be sure it does not use memcmp on C-strings.\\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: Locking macros may expand to inline helpers or wrappers; include them to ensure no hidden memcmp usage or transformations of pointer/size arguments that could turn a buffer compare into a C-string compare.\\n- struct lfs / typedef lfs_t: The lfs object layout (particularly the cfg field) and any methods/macros tied to it may influence how buffer and size are interpreted; you need the type to follow how data passed into setattr is used.\\n- typedef lfs_size_t: The exact type and semantics of size are necessary to determine whether comparisons use size-limited memcmp (acceptable) or assume null-termination (problematic)."
