  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_setattr:\n```c\nint lfs_setattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_setattr(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %\"PRIu8\", %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    err = lfs_setattr_(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_setattr -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_setattr:\nstatic int lfs_setattr_(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    if (size > lfs->attr_max) {\n        return LFS_ERR_NOSPC;\n    }\n\n    return lfs_commitattr(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_commitattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    lfs_mdir_t cwd;\n    lfs_stag_t tag = lfs_dir_find(lfs, &cwd, &path, NULL);\n    if (tag < 0) {\n        return tag;\n    }\n\n    uint16_t id = lfs_tag_id(tag);\n    if (id == 0x3ff) {\n        // special case for root\n        id = 0;\n        int err = lfs_dir_fetch(lfs, &cwd, lfs->root);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return lfs_dir_commit(lfs, &cwd, LFS_MKATTRS(\n            {LFS_MKTAG(LFS_TYPE_USERATTR + type, id, size), buffer}));\n}\n...\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic int lfs_setattr_(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    if (size > lfs->attr_max) {\n        return LFS_ERR_NOSPC;\n    }\n\n    return lfs_commitattr(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "No violation: LFS_TRACE is defined as an empty macro, so uses like LFS_TRACE(\"...\") expand to nothing and generate no executed code. Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect behaviour; here there is no executed operation to be removed. (Note: if a trace macro were defined to call a function that had no observable effect, that could constitute dead code.)"
