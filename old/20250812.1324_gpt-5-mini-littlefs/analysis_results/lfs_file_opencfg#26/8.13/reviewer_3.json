The operation is an assertion/check (should not modify the object), so the pointer should be to a const-qualified type. This usage therefore violates the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. For example, if lfs_mlist_isopen does not modify the mlist object, its prototype should be changed to accept a const struct lfs_mlist * and the call should be: lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (const struct lfs_mlist *)file) (or better, use a proper typed const pointer without casts).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint lfs_file_opencfg(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        const char *path, int flags,\n        const struct lfs_file_config *cfg) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_opencfg(%p, %p, \\\"%s\\\", %x, %p {\"\n                 \".buffer=%p, .attrs=%p, .attr_count=%\"PRIu32\"})\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, path, (unsigned)flags,\n            (void*)cfg, cfg->buffer, (void*)cfg->attrs, cfg->attr_count);\n\n    /* Probe logging: record the pointers and the cast that is performed\n       to provide evidence for the pointer-to-const concern described in\n       the violation scenario.

  "explanation": "Not enough evidence to conclude a definite MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 violation. The reported concern is plausible \u2014 if lfs_mlist_isopen does not modify the mlist object, its parameter should indeed be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (e.g. const struct lfs_mlist *), and callers should not cast to a non-const pointer. However, the snippet as given does not show the prototype of lfs_mlist_isopen nor whether that function modifies the object. The code casts file (of type lfs_file_t *) to (struct lfs_mlist *) \u2014 this is a cast between incompatible types, not an obvious discard of const qualification (file is non-const in the caller). The cast and the type mismatch are more directly a type-safety issue (related to pointer conversions) than a demonstrated 8.13 violation. Therefore the agent A's report is not provably correct from the provided code. Recommendation: inspect the prototype and implementation of lfs_mlist_isopen; if it does not modify the pointed object, change its parameter to const struct lfs_mlist * and remove the cast (or perform a cast to const if the types require it). If it does modify the object, then non-const is appropriate and there is no 8.13 violation."
