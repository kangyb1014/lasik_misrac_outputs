  "explanation": "- lfs_stat_: The target function immediately delegates to lfs_stat_. Any use of memcmp on path or directory names will occur there, so its body must be inspected.\n- lfs_dir_find: Called by lfs_stat_. This function is a likely place where a filename/path is compared against directory entries; we must see whether it uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: Called by lfs_stat_. It may assemble or compare name fields when filling struct lfs_info; inspect for memcmp usage on string buffers.\n- lfs_tag_type3: Callee of lfs_stat_. Although it deals with tags, its implementation could use memcmp on string-like tag data; include to be safe.\n- lfs_tag_id: Callee of lfs_stat_. Same rationale as lfs_tag_type3 \u2014 examine for any memcmp usage on null-terminated data.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets this function. You must examine all call sites (and any macros/wrappers that map to it) in the above functions to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated C strings.\n- struct lfs_info: The lfs_stat signature writes into this structure; its fields (names, buffers, lengths) determine whether comparisons in callees operate on null-terminated strings versus explicit-length buffers.\n- lfs_t: Contains configuration and filesystem structures (e.g., name buffers or cfg flags) that may affect how comparisons are performed; include to understand data layouts passed into callees.\n\nInspect the bodies of the listed functions and the memcmp call sites (and any macros/wrappers around memcmp) to determine if memcmp is ever used to compare null-terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
