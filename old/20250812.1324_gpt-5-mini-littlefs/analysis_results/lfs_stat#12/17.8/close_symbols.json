  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK (macro): lfs_stat calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). Because this is a macro expanding into code in the caller, its expansion could reassign the parameter variables (e.g. lfs) or otherwise modify them. You must inspect the macro body to determine whether any of the function parameters are modified (which would violate MISRA).\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro): similarly a macro invoked in the caller; its expansion could modify parameter variables or perform assignments that affect the parameters. Its definition is needed.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): called twice with the parameter names. As a macro it expands in the caller and might perform side effects (including assignments to parameter identifiers). You must inspect its definition to ensure it does not reassign lfs, path, or info.\n- lfs_t (type definition): needed to understand the expression lfs->cfg passed to LFS_LOCK and whether any macro expansion could act on lfs as a whole or on its members in a way that reassigns the parameter variable. Also useful to see if cfg is a macro or special type that affects macro behavior.\n- struct lfs_info (type definition): to confirm whether info is declared as a pointer to mutable or const object and to understand any macros that might depend on its structure when expanding; also helps determine whether modifications would be to the pointer variable (disallowed) or to the pointed-to object (allowed).\n- lfs_stat_ (function): although a normal function call cannot reassign the caller's parameter variables (it only receives copies), include the callee definition to confirm it is a real function (not a macro/inline expansion) and to verify there are no surprising macros or inline definitions that actually expand into the caller and could modify the parameters."
