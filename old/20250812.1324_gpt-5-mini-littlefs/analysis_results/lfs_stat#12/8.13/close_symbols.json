  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201ca pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d you must know how each pointer parameter and accessed pointer field is declared and whether those pointers are modified. Brief reasons per symbol:\n\n- lfs_stat_: its prototype/definition is required to see how it forwards the 'path' and 'info' pointers (does it accept const char *path and/or const struct lfs_info *?), and whether it modifies or passes them to non-const APIs.\n\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: likely the routine that fills/updates the struct lfs_info instance. Its prototype/definition shows whether it takes a non-const struct lfs_info * (thus justifying non-const in lfs_stat) or could be const.\n\n- lfs_dir_find: used by lfs_stat_ (per call graph) and may accept or mutate the path buffer; its signature/behavior determines whether path can be const-qualified.\n\n- lfs_tag_type3 and lfs_tag_id: called (indirectly via lfs_stat_) and may operate on tag/pointer arguments; their signatures/behavior help determine whether any pointers passed through must be non-const.\n\n- struct lfs_t: the type of parameter lfs \u2014 needed to inspect its members and pointer types (notably cfg) to see if any member pointers should/should not be const.\n\n- struct lfs_info: full definition is required to know whether fields are input-only or output fields (i.e., whether info is written by lfs_stat_/helpers and thus must be non-const).\n\n- struct lfs_config (type of lfs->cfg): lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; you must know the declared type of cfg to decide whether it could be const-qualified and whether those lock macros require a mutable pointer.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function definitions): their parameter types show whether they require a non-const pointer to cfg (preventing cfg from being const-qualified) or accept const \u2014 important to determine whether cfg could be const.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): it is invoked with path and info pointers. Its prototype/definition may take non-const pointer parameters (e.g., varargs/formatting helpers) and could force non-constness or use casts; inspect to see if it forces removal of const.\n\nIn short: you need the prototypes/definitions of the called helpers (lfs_stat_, lfs_dir_* and tag helpers), the concrete definitions of the involved types (lfs_t, lfs_info, and the cfg type), and the lock/trace macro definitions to determine whether any pointer passed in or stored should or can be const-qualified."
