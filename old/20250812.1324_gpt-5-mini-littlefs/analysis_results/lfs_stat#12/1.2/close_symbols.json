  ],
  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions/implementations of these symbols to determine whether any language/compiler extensions are used (and thus violate the MISRA rule). Reasoning for each: \n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or function invoked directly in lfs_stat. If it is a macro, its expansion can hide compiler extensions (GNU statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, inline assembly, GCC __attribute__ usage, builtins, or nonstandard variadic macro features). If it is an inline function it might carry function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its definition/expansion must be checked for any compiler-specific extensions or attributes.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace/log macros commonly use variadic macros, helper functions, or exotic macro constructs (statement expressions, compound literals, GCC variadic extension, format-string attributes, __builtin_*). The macro expansion may introduce extensions (or call helper functions that do). You need the exact macro/body to judge.\n\n- lfs_stat_ (prototype/definition): Although called from lfs_stat, its declaration/definition could use language extensions (GCC function attributes like nonnull, printf-like format checking, inline/asm, or nonstandard linkage specifiers). The prototype may also be a macro wrapping attributes.\n\n- typedef/struct lfs_t (definition, incl. cfg member and its type): The lfs->cfg member is passed to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; the struct/type definition may itself use extensions (anonymous structs/unions, bit-field widths using implementation-defined types, zero-length arrays, flexible array usage beyond standard, or attributes on members). You must examine the type to see if any extension syntax appears.\n\n- struct lfs_info (definition): The struct passed to lfs_stat may contain nonstandard constructs (anonymous members, attributes, zero-length arrays, or other compiler-specific declarations) or declarations that are implemented as macros.\n\n- any helper(s) called/expanded by LFS_TRACE: If LFS_TRACE expands to calls to other internal trace/print helpers, those helpers and their declarations/definitions must be inspected for extensions (printf attribute, builtin usage, inline assembly, gcc attributes, etc.).\n\nIn short: macros and type definitions are the likely locations of hidden compiler extensions. Inspecting the listed symbols (their macro expansions, prototypes, and type definitions) is necessary to determine compliance with the MISRA rule about language extensions."
