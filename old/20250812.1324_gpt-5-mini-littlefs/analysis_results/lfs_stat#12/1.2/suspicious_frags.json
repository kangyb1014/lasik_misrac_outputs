  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specific notes: \n- LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) is a variadic macro; variadic macros using __VA_ARGS__ are standard since C99 (not a compiler extension).\n- The casts (void*)lfs and (void*)info are standard C pointer casts; the (void)cfg cast inside macros is the standard idiom to suppress unused-parameter warnings.\n- The comma operator in the LFS_LOCK definition ((void)cfg,0) is standard C and returns 0 as intended.\n- LFS_UNLOCK expands to ((void)cfg) which yields an expression of type void used as an expression statement \u2014 standard C.\n- There are no compiler-specific extensions present (no __attribute__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline asm, or other vendor-specific tokens).\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 for use of language extensions."
