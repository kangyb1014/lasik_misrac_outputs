  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: this is invoked with lfs->cfg and may be a macro or inline function. If it is a macro it could expand into code that assigns to the formal parameter 'lfs' (or otherwise modifies the parameter variable). To prove the target function does not modify its parameter you must inspect the LFS_LOCK definition.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 it is invoked with lfs->cfg and could be a macro that expands into code which modifies the parameter variable. Its definition is required to ensure no assignment to 'lfs'.\n- LFS_TRACE: tracing is often a macro taking expressions; a macro expansion could contain side effects that modify variables. Inspecting LFS_TRACE ensures the (void*)lfs use is not transformed into code that assigns to the parameter.\n- lfs_fs_gc_ (declaration/definition): this is the only direct callee. While changes to the object pointed-to by *lfs are allowed, we must verify that lfs_fs_gc_ is not a macro or function-like construct that could modify the caller's parameter variable (for example via unusual macro expansions or by taking a pointer-to-pointer). The callee's prototype/definition confirms whether the call can change the caller's formal parameter.\n- lfs_t (type definition, including the cfg member): the parameter's type and its members (especially cfg used in the lock/unlock calls) are needed to understand how expressions like lfs->cfg and the (void*)lfs cast behave and to rule out any hidden macro/operator overloading or unusual typedefs that could cause modification of the parameter variable itself."
