  "explanation": "- struct lfs (typedef lfs_t) definition: needed to see which members are modified by called functions and whether the lfs object itself could be passed as const (the parameter is lfs_t *lfs).\\n- declaration/type of lfs->cfg (cfg member): LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg; we must know the cfg type and its qualifiers to decide if the cfg pointer should be const or if LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK require a mutable pointer.\\n- prototype/implementation of lfs_fs_gc_: the target forwards lfs to this helper; to decide whether lfs in the caller can be const we must know whether lfs_fs_gc_ (and how) mutates the lfs object or requires non-const pointer parameters.\\n- implementations/prototypes of lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan: these are called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_fs_gc_. Any mutation of lfs or its members in these functions prevents making the pointer const; their signatures indicate whether they accept const-qualified pointers.\\n- definition of LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macros or underlying functions): their parameter types determine whether passing lfs->cfg requires a mutable pointer (non-const) \u2014 if they accept non-const pointers or perform writes, the cfg cannot be const-qualified.\\n- definition of LFS_TRACE (macro or function): lfs is cast to (void*) for a trace call; we must check the trace prototype (e.g., expects const void* vs void*) and whether this cast discards const qualification (possible MISRA violation).\\n\\nProviding these symbols lets the analyst determine whether any pointer in lfs_fs_gc (the lfs parameter or lfs->cfg) could/should be const or whether casts remove const qualifiers, which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA rule on const-qualified pointers."
