  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_fs_gc (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must inspect any callee that might call memcmp and the data passed into memcmp. Therefore include: (1) lfs_fs_gc_ (the immediate callee) because it contains the real work and may call memcmp; (2) all its static callees (lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan) because memcmp could be used in any of them to compare buffers that might be C strings; (3) the memcmp symbol (declaration in <string.h>) so the analyzer can recognize uses of the standard function; (4) the definitions of data structures used as memcmp arguments (notably lfs_pair_t and the directory/entry structs used by lfs_dir_fetch/commit) so you can determine whether the buffers passed to memcmp are null\u2011terminated strings or raw byte buffers; and (5) the definition of lfs_t and its cfg member so you can follow types and members passed through these calls. With these symbols the next agent can locate every memcmp call reachable from lfs_fs_gc and determine whether the arguments are null\u2011terminated strings (MISRA violation) or non\u2011string byte buffers (allowed)."
