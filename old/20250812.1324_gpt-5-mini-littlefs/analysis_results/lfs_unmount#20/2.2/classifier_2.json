  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The statement int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); is an initialization using a lock macro that in this configuration expands to ((void)cfg,0). Per MISRA R2.2 note 3, initialisation is not the same as an assignment and is not a candidate for dead code. Furthermore, LFS_LOCK is a configuration point: in other builds it may perform real locking (side effects). Although with the given macro the value is always 0 and the subsequent if (err) branch will never be taken, this pattern is intentionally present to support alternate configurations; therefore it does not constitute a project-level dead-code violation. (If LFS_LOCK were guaranteed to be a no-op in all builds and the initialized value were never meaningfully used, then the initialization and the guarded branch could be considered dead code.)"
