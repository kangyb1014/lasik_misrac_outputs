  "explanation": "To decide whether the parameter lfs could/should be declared as a pointer-to-const under MISRA's \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" rule, the analyzer must know every use that requires a mutable lfs or that would discard/require const. The required symbols are:\n\n- lfs_unmount_: need the prototype/definition to see whether it takes a non-const lfs_t* or otherwise modifies the object; if it mutates lfs or its members it prevents making the caller's parameter const.\n- lfs_deinit: lfs_unmount_ calls lfs_deinit; the deinit implementation/prototype must be inspected to determine whether it mutates lfs (or its members) and thus whether lfs must be non-const transitively.\n- lfs_t (complete struct definition, including member 'cfg' and its type): the exact type and const-qualification of members (especially cfg) are required to know whether reading lfs->cfg and passing it to lock/unlock/other APIs would be allowed from a const lfs_t*. If cfg is itself a pointer-to-non-const or if accessing cfg implies mutation, lfs cannot be const.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): the lock implementation/signature must be checked to see whether it accepts a const-qualified cfg pointer or requires a non-const pointer (or performs writes). Passing lfs->cfg to LFS_LOCK may force lfs/its cfg member to be non-const.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 must know whether it requires a mutable cfg pointer or drops const.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function): the trace call casts (void*)lfs. The trace API signature determines whether this cast would discard const (e.g., if it expects void* vs const void*) or whether it performs any mutation or storage of the pointer. If LFS_TRACE's interface requires a mutable void* (or performs non-const operations), that prevents declaring the parameter as pointer-to-const.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the analyzer determine whether any callee or macro requires mutation or performs const-discarding casts; if none do, lfs could be made a pointer-to-const per MISRA."
