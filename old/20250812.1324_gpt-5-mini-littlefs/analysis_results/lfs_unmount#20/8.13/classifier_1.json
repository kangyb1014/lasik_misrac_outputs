  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the shown fragment. The call LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) passes a (presumably) mutable pointer to a lock/unlock facility; locking typically modifies synchronization state (or uses APIs that require non-const pointers), so the pointer cannot be const-qualified. A violation would occur if the implementation of LFS_LOCK (or the underlying function it expands to) does not modify the object pointed to by cfg but its parameter is non-const \u2014 in that case the parameter should be declared as a pointer to const to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
