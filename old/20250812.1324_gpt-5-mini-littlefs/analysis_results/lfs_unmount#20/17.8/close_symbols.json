  "explanation": "To decide if lfs_unmount violates the MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" we must inspect any symbols that can expand into or execute code that assigns to or takes the address of the parameter variable 'lfs' in the caller.\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is used at the start (LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it can expand into code that assigns to the local parameter identifier 'lfs' (or takes &lfs and modifies it). We must see its definition to ensure it does not modify the parameter variable.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK (called with lfs->cfg). If implemented as a macro it could modify the caller's parameter variable; its definition must be checked.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function is passed expressions involving 'lfs'. Trace macros sometimes evaluate arguments multiple times or expand into code that could reference or modify local names; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not assign to 'lfs' or take &lfs.\n\n- lfs_unmount_: The apparent callee. If lfs_unmount_ is a macro that expands inline at the call site it could contain code that assigns to the parameter identifier 'lfs' (for example a macro that does \"lfs = NULL; ...\"). If it is a real function, it cannot directly change the caller's local parameter variable (passed by value), but we still need the symbol to determine whether it is a macro or a function and to inspect any inline expansion that might modify the parameter identifier.\n\n- lfs_deinit: According to the static call graph lfs_unmount_ calls lfs_deinit. If lfs_unmount_ is a macro that expands to code invoking lfs_deinit (or embeds its body), lfs_deinit's definition may be needed to see whether that expansion could modify the caller's parameter identifier. If lfs_unmount_ is a function, lfs_deinit is less relevant for the parameter-variable check, but include it to cover macro/inline cases.\n\n- lfs_t: The typedef/struct declaration for lfs_t (and its cfg field) is needed to confirm there are no tricky macro aliases or field-like macros (e.g., cfg being a macro) that could cause the lfs identifier to be reassigned via lfs->cfg usage. It also helps verify that expressions used in macros match expected types and do not hide side-effects that could alter the parameter variable.\n\nIn short: prioritize the macro/function definitions of LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE and lfs_unmount_ (and, if lfs_unmount_ expands into or references other code, lfs_deinit), plus the lfs_t definition to rule out hidden modifications of the parameter identifier."
