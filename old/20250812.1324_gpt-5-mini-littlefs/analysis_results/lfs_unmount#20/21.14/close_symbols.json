  "explanation": "- lfs_unmount_: This is the direct callee of lfs_unmount. To determine whether lfs_unmount violates the MISRA memcmp rule you must inspect lfs_unmount_ for any use (direct or indirect) of memcmp or for passing string pointers to lower-level calls.\n- lfs_deinit: Static call graph shows lfs_unmount_ calls lfs_deinit. lfs_deinit may contain memcmp usage (or call other wrappers that do). It must be inspected to see whether memcmp is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets the standard memcmp function itself. You must locate all memcmp call sites (in lfs_unmount_, lfs_deinit or deeper) and examine the arguments and their semantics (are they null\u2011terminated C strings?) to decide if the rule is violated."
