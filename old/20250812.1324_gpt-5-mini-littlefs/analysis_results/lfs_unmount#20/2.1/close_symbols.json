  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: determine its expansion/behaviour and return semantics (e.g. always non\u2011zero, longjmp/exit, or never returns). If LFS_LOCK always returns non\u2011zero or does not return, the early \"return err;\" makes the rest of the function unreachable.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: needed to check whether it has side\u2011effects or non\u2011returning behaviour that affects reachability of code before/after it. Also to confirm whether calling it is required by the lock semantics.  \n- LFS_TRACE: often a macro; it could expand to code that does not return (e.g. abort) or to nothing. Its definition is required to decide if the trace calls make following statements unreachable.  \n- lfs_unmount_: the callee invoked by lfs_unmount; its implementation may not return (infinite loop, exit, longjmp) or may itself make parts of lfs_unmount unreachable, so its body must be inspected.  \n- lfs_deinit: a callee of lfs_unmount_; it may contain non\u2011returning behaviour that propagates back and renders later code in lfs_unmount unreachable.  \n- lfs_t (struct definition, including cfg field): needed to resolve the type passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK (cfg) and to understand any macros that depend on cfg contents (which could affect lock semantics and reachability)."
