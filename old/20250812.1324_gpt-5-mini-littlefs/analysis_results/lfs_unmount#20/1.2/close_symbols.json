  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is used in the call LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). It is commonly a macro; you must inspect its definition to see whether it expands to compiler extensions (GCC/Clang statement-expressions, __attribute__, inline asm, typeof(), builtins, nested functions, non-standard variadic handling, or other documented extensions).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 check the macro/function body for any compiler-specific extension usage.\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macros frequently use variadic macros or non-standard helpers. You need the full macro/function definition to determine whether it relies on language extensions (variadic macro extensions, statement expressions, __builtin_\u2026 calls, custom attributes, or use of non\u2011standard format specifiers).\n- lfs_unmount_: Although shown as a callee, its implementation may use language extensions (inline assembly, attributes, GNU statement expressions, nested functions, etc.) that affect whether the call from lfs_unmount uses extensions. Inspect its definition.\n- struct lfs (definition of lfs_t): The lfs_t type may include compiler-specific attributes on the struct or its members (packed/aligned attributes, anonymous/unnamed unions/structs that are extensions in some compilers, bit-field layouts, or other annotations). The type definition is needed to detect such extensions.\n- type/definition of lfs->cfg (configuration type): The cfg object passed into LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK may have fields or function-pointer types that use extensions (attribute annotations, non-standard types), and the macros may depend on cfg layout. Inspect its definition.\n- underlying trace/log functions or macros used by LFS_TRACE (e.g. printf, vprintf, or a trace callback): If LFS_TRACE forwards to other functions/macros, those implementations must be checked for extensions (builtins, attributes, nonstandard I/O functions).\n\nIn short: every macro or type referenced directly by lfs_unmount (the LFS_* macros, the called function lfs_unmount_, and the types used by those macros/calls) must be inspected to determine whether any language/compiler extensions are used. Include their full definitions (macro expansions and function/type bodies) when analyzing for MISRA C language-extension violations."
