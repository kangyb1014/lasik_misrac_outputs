  "explanation": "I found no uses of any of the <string.h> functions named by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided code fragments. lfs_unmount calls lfs_unmount_ which calls lfs_deinit; lfs_deinit performs pointer checks and calls lfs_free but does not use any string.h functions. The macros LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, and LFS_TRACE are defined as no-ops in the provided code, so they do not introduce string function calls. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require investigation for Rule 21.17. (If implementations not shown here \u2014 for example lfs_free or other omitted functions/macros \u2014 call any string.h functions, those implementations should be inspected.)"
