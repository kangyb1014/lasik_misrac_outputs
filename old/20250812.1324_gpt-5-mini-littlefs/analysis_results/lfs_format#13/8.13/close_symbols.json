  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule \"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" in lfs_format, the analyzer must see any symbol that affects whether pointers are (or must be) const or have their constness removed/cast away:\n\n- struct lfs_config (definition): lfs_format takes a const struct lfs_config *cfg and the function accesses many members (buffers, function-pointer fields). You must know the exact member types (and whether they are pointer-to-const) to determine whether members or their pointers should be const and whether any casts remove const qualifiers.\n\n- lfs_t (definition): the first parameter is lfs_t *lfs. To decide if this pointer could/should be const, you must know lfs_t's contents and how it is used by called routines.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): called at the top with cfg (a const pointer). Many lock macros/functions accept non-const pointers or cast away const. You must inspect its definition to see if it removes const qualification (which would be a MISRA issue) or otherwise requires cfg to be non-const.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 must check whether it casts away const or expects non-const.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): the call site explicitly casts (void*)cfg and (void*)lfs, which discards const. You need the macro (and surrounding logging utilities) to see whether these casts are necessary/avoidable and whether the logging usage violates MISRA (casting away const in formatting or macro expansion).\n\n- lfs_format_ (implementation/signature): lfs_format simply forwards lfs and cfg to lfs_format_. To determine if lfs (or cfg) really must be non-const, you must inspect lfs_format_ to see whether it modifies the pointed-to objects or passes them to non-const APIs.\n\n- lfs_init, lfs_min, lfs_alloc_ckpoint, lfs_dir_alloc, lfs_fs_disk_version, lfs_superblock_tole32, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_deinit (signatures/implementations): these are callees of lfs_format_. To conclude whether lfs_format (and its parameters) could be const-qualified, you must see how these functions accept and use the lfs_t* and any pointers derived from cfg (e.g., buffers or function pointers). If any of these routines require non-const pointers or perform casts that remove const, that justifies non-const in the public API; otherwise, the pointer should be const.\n\nIn summary, to judge MISRA const-qualification compliance for lfs_format you need the type definitions for the parameters, the locking/unlocking/logging macros that use them, the implementation of lfs_format_ (which determines intended mutability), and the downstream functions called by lfs_format_ that operate on those pointers."
