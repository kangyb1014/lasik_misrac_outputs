The left operand (void)cfg is evaluated at runtime but has no side-effects and its removal (replacing the macro with 0) would not change program behaviour (it only suppresses an unused-parameter warning). Thus the (void)cfg operation is an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 dead code according to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Example: in lfs_format the statement int err = LFS_LOCK(cfg); executes (void)cfg but this has no effect on behaviour, so it constitutes dead code.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void lfs_log_state(const char *stage, const void *lfs, const struct lfs_config *cfg, int err) {\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/106.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"STAGE: %s\\n\", stage);\n    fprintf(f, \"  lfs=%p, cfg=%p, err=%d\\n\", lfs, (const void*)cfg, err);\n\n    if (cfg) {\n        /* Print a selection of fields that reflect configuration/state.

  "explanation": "Not correct. The agent\u2019s reasoning treats the single use at this call site in isolation. Whether an evaluated operation is \u201cdead code\u201d must be judged against the program\u2019s observable behaviour across the project and across all possible uses. The macro expansion ((void)cfg, 0) intentionally evaluates the cfg operand: that evaluation can be observable in some usages (for example if the argument is an expression with side\u2011effects, or if it is a volatile access or otherwise affects timing/ordering). Removing the (void)cfg from the macro could therefore change behaviour at other call sites, so the cast cannot be categorically classified as dead code at project scope. Even at this particular call site the (void) cast is the standard idiom to mark an unused parameter; its presence is not a semantic error in the way Rule 2.2 targets (and MISRA guidance generally recognises this idiom). The probe\u2019s failure to log does not demonstrate a Rule 2.2 violation \u2014 it only shows that in this concrete execution the cast had no observable effect. That is not sufficient to establish a project\u2011level dead\u2011code violation."
