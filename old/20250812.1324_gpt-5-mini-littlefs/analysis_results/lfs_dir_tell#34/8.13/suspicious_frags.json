  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 8.13 concern is whether pointer parameters could be const-qualified. The selected fragments are the function declarations/definitions that accept pointer parameters and the uses/casts of those pointers (the LFS_TRACE call that casts to (void*) and the LFS_LOCK access of lfs->cfg, and the call that passes the pointers to lfs_dir_tell_). These locations should be investigated to determine if the pointed-to objects are modified and whether the parameters can be declared as pointers to const.\n\nOther parts of the provided code do not need investigation for this rule: the second LFS_TRACE that prints the scalar res, the LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) call (aside from its use of lfs->cfg already highlighted), the return statements, and the (void)lfs; line in lfs_dir_tell_ are not places where pointer-to-non-const vs pointer-to-const qualification would be determined. They either operate on scalars or are simple no-op silence of unused parameters and therefore are not relevant to deciding whether pointer parameters should be const-qualified."
