  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments for investigation because they either already use const where appropriate or clearly require a mutable pointer: - The lfs_file_open() parameters: 'path' is const-qualified and 'lfs' and 'file' are intended to be modified by the function (locking/unlocking and initializing the file) so they should remain non-const. - Members of lfs_file_t: the 'cfg' member is already declared as a pointer to const, and other members are mutable state that the implementation will modify. - The logging/tracing casts (e.g. (void*)file) are just for diagnostics and do not indicate missing const qualifications. The selected fragments are those where pointers are passed or compared but appear not to be const-qualified even though the operations performed do not modify the pointed-to objects (and/or a const object is being passed to a non-const parameter), so they warrant further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
