  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. Given the provided macro definition LFS_LOCK(...) -> ((void)cfg, 0), the expression int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); always yields err == 0, so the condition if (err) can never be true and the body (return err;) is unreachable in this project configuration. The probe logs consistently show err=0 for all runs and never show the probe message inside the if (err) branch, confirming the branch is never taken. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (a project shall not contain unreachable code), the presence of that never-executed branch in the project constitutes a violation."
