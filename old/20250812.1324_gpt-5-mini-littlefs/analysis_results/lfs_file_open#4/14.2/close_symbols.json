Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_open violates the MISRA C for-loop well-formedness rule we must inspect any code reachable from it that might contain for loops or affect loop control objects. The required symbols are:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Direct callee of lfs_file_open. It may contain for loops (or reference objects used by loops) whose clauses and body must be checked. The rule treats the behaviour of a loop body as including functions called inside it, so any loops in this function are relevant.\n\n- lfs_file_open_: Direct callee that performs the real open work. It may contain for loops or call other functions that do; its body must be inspected for loop counters, side effects, and modifications to objects used in loop clauses.\n\n- lfs_file_opencfg_: Callee of lfs_file_open_. Any for loops in this deeper callee are also reachable from lfs_file_open and must be checked.\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: Macros or functions invoked at entry/exit. They could contain loops or modify objects (locks, status flags) used by loops elsewhere; their implementations must be checked for for-statements and for modifications to objects that might be used as loop counters/flags.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macro/function used in lfs_file_open. Tracing implementations sometimes expand to code that may include loops or function calls; include to be safe.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro may expand to code (possibly calls) that could contain loops or modify state used by loops; include for completeness.\n\n- lfs_t (type/definition): The structure definition is needed to know the types and identities of members accessed (cfg, mlist). You must know whether any fields are aliasing or are modified by callees, and whether they could serve as loop counters or loop-control flags.\n\n- lfs_file_t (type/definition): The file object type is cast to struct lfs_mlist* in the call to lfs_mlist_isopen; its layout/aliases could affect whether objects used in loop clauses are modified in loop bodies.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (type/definition): The mlist structure is passed to lfs_mlist_isopen; to reason about objects used as loop counters or control flags (and whether they are modified in loop bodies) you need the member definitions and semantics.\n\n- lfs->cfg (configuration / lock object type): The exact type and semantics of cfg (lock/config object) matter because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK receive it; those routines/macros might modify global or pointed-to state that could be used by loops called from these functions.\n\nIn short: include all direct callees and their callees that are reachable from lfs_file_open, the locking/tracing/assert macros invoked by it, and the relevant type/structure definitions for lfs and file objects. These are the minimal symbols needed to locate and analyze any for statements that are reachable from lfs_file_open and to check the three clauses and allowed side-effects per the MISRA rule."
