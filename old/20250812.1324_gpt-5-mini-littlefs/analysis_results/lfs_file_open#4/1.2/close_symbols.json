  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions of the following symbols because they can hide compiler/language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule. Explainations: \n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros (or inline functions) used for locking via lfs->cfg. Their expansions may use compiler extensions (statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, __extension__, or compiler-specific locking primitives). Verify their definitions to ensure no GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific extensions are used.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is variadic and may expand to non-standard constructs (variadic macro syntax is standard C99 but some implementations add extensions), use __attribute__((format(...))), statement-expressions, or compiler builtins. Check its definition for any explicit compiler extensions.\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro may use do{...}while(0) (standard) or use extensions (statement-expressions, __builtin_expect, __attribute__, typeof, asm). Its definition must be checked.\n- lfs_t (and its cfg member type): The type of lfs->cfg could be a typedef or struct that carries attributes (packed, aligned) or uses compiler-specific keywords (e.g., __attribute__, __packed, __aligned__) or nonstandard bit-field implementations. Inspect the type and its headers for extensions.\n- lfs_file_t: The file object type may be a struct or alias that uses extensions (attributes, anonymous structs/unions, statement-expressions in inline helpers). Check its definition.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Although called here only for its boolean result, its definition could be an inline function or macro using extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, __attribute__, use of GCC extension for anonymous struct/union). Inspect to ensure no extensions are used.\n- lfs_file_open_: This internal helper is called by the target; it (or its callees) may be defined with attributes (e.g., __attribute__((always_inline))), use inline assembly, or other extensions. Inspect its definition.\n- lfs_file_opencfg_: As a callee of lfs_file_open_ it may contain attributes or use compiler extensions; examine it as well.\n\nIn short: any macro or type referenced by lfs_file_open can expand to compiler-specific constructs \u2014 these symbol definitions must be checked to determine compliance with the MISRA prohibition on language/compiler extensions."
