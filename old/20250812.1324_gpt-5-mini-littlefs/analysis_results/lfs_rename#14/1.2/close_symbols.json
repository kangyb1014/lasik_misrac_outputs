  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is used directly in lfs_rename and is almost certainly a macro. Its expansion must be inspected to detect any compiler-specific extensions (statement-expressions ({ ... }), __attribute__, inline asm, __builtin_*, typeof, nested functions, non\u2011standard keywords, compiler-specific pragmas, etc.).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 likely a macro/inline and may hide compiler extensions in its definition.\n- LFS_TRACE: A logging/tracing macro invoked with printf-style arguments. Trace macros commonly use variadic macros, statement-expressions, __attribute__((format)), or compiler builtins; its definition must be checked for any language extensions.\n- lfs_rename_: The called internal function: its prototype/definition must be checked for any function-level extensions (e.g. __attribute__ annotations, inline asm, nonstandard calling conventions, nested function definitions, or other compiler-specific constructs) that would make the user-facing API use an extension.\n- lfs_t: The type of the first parameter. Its typedef/struct definition must be inspected for any nonstandard type extensions (anonymous/unnamed structs/unions as extensions in some compilers, attributes on types, zero-width bitfields, packed/align attributes, or other compiler-specific decorations).\n- struct lfs_config: The type of lfs->cfg (configuration member) referenced in LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. Its definition must be inspected because macros operating on lfs->cfg may rely on compiler extensions attached to that type or its members.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the macro definitions and the definitions/prototypes of types and lfs_rename_) lets the next analyst determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used in the code paths exercised by lfs_rename."
