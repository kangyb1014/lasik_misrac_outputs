  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as presented. Agent A assumes LFS_LOCK is defined as the no-op macro ((void)cfg, 0) and therefore treats the err branch as statically unreachable. Whether that branch is unreachable is a property of the whole project/configuration: many codebases make LFS_LOCK a no-op only for certain build configurations (or via a header macro), and in other configurations it can be a real locking function that returns errors. Agent A did not show the actual project-wide definition or prove that every translation unit and every build configuration makes LFS_LOCK compile to the constant 0; nor did they run a whole-project static analysis that would be required to establish a MISRA 2.1 violation. The runtime probe and empty log do not prove static unreachability. To decide correctly you must inspect the project's definition(s) of LFS_LOCK for all configurations or run a whole-program static analysis; only if LFS_LOCK is provably always the constant 0 in the project would this be a Rule 2.1 violation."
