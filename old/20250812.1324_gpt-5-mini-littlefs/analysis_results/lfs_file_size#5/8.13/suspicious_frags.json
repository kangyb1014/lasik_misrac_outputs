  "explanation": "I flagged the function parameter declaration and the places where pointers are cast/used because they may be eligible for const qualification or may be masking constness via casts and should be investigated. I did not flag other pointer-containing fragments because: - Fields already declared const (e.g. const struct lfs_config *cfg; const struct lfs_file_config *cfg;) are correctly const-qualified. - Pointer fields that represent mutable linked-list or cache state (e.g. next pointers, caches, ctz members, flags, position/offset fields) are typically intended to be modified and therefore should not be made const. - Macro usage that takes the existing cfg pointer (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK) and printing casts to (void*) for logging are idiomatic and do not by themselves indicate missing const qualification. Based on the provided code, the listed fragments are the places most likely to deserve review for Rule 8.13; other pointer usages appear to either already be const or appropriately mutable."
