  "explanation": "For checking MISRA violation about language extensions we must inspect any symbols whose definitions could themselves use compiler extensions (attributes, inline asm, statement-expressions, typeof, variadic/gnu macros, nonstandard keywords, etc.) or introduce non\u2011standard types/formatting. Short reasons:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: macro/function invoked directly; its definition may use compiler extensions (e.g. statement-expression, typeof, __sync builtins, attributes). Need to see its expansion/type.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same as LFS_LOCK (unlock macro/function may hide extensions).\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro \u2014 commonly uses variadic macros, GCC extensions, or format attributes; must inspect its definition to detect language extensions (variadic macro syntax, ##__VA_ARGS__, __attribute__ etc.).\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro may expand to compiler-specific constructs (do/while, __builtin_trap, __attribute__, etc.); inspect for extensions.\n- lfs_soff_t: typedef used as return type \u2014 its definition may use nonstandard integer types or compiler-specific typedefs (bitfields, __int128, packed attributes).\n- lfs_t: structure type of first parameter; its definition (members like cfg, mlist) may use extensions (packed/aligned attributes, anonymous structs/unions, typeof usage).\n- lfs_file_t: file handle type \u2014 its layout/typedef may use extensions (anonymous unions, attributes, bitfields).\n- struct lfs_mlist: used in a cast in the call; its definition could use anonymous structs/unions or other extensions.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: callee used in an assertion \u2014 its prototype/definition could involve extensions (non\u2011standard attributes, inline asm, GCC-specific calling conventions).\n- lfs_file_size_: internal helper called and returning lfs_soff_t \u2014 its definition may use extensions or return types/expressions that are nonstandard; also it calls lfs_max so inspect that as well.\n- lfs_max: used by lfs_file_size_ (in static call graph) \u2014 lfs_max may be a macro or inline function that uses extensions (statement-expression, typeof, GCC inline asm, etc.).\n- PRIu32: format macro used in LFS_TRACE format string \u2014 this macro expansion and any surrounding formatting macros (or reliance on inttypes.h implementation) should be checked for portability/extension issues.\n\nProvide the definitions/headers for these symbols to the next analyzer so it can determine whether any of them (or their use) relies on compiler language extensions."
