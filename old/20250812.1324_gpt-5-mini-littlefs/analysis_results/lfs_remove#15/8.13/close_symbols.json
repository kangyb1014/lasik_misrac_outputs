  "explanation": "- lfs_remove_: must inspect the called implementation/prototype to see whether it mutates the objects pointed to by its pointer parameters (especially lfs and/or path). If lfs_remove_ does not modify certain pointed-to data, those pointer parameters could be const and that affects whether the wrapper lfs_remove should use const.\\n- lfs_t: the full struct definition is required to determine which members are pointers and whether those members (and their pointed-to types) could/should be const. In particular we must know whether lfs itself is conceptually mutable.\\n- (type of) lfs->cfg (cfg member): LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg. We need the exact type of cfg to see whether it is declared const-qualified or could be const; this affects whether passing lfs->cfg to locking/unlocking APIs forces it to be non-const and therefore whether lfs_t (or its cfg member) must remain non-const.\\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: their definitions/prototypes (macro or function) are needed to know the parameter types and whether they take const-qualified pointers. If these APIs require non-const pointers (because they modify the pointed data), then lfs->cfg (and possibly lfs_t) cannot be const; if they accept const pointers then const could be used.\\n- LFS_TRACE: its definition/macro signature is needed to check whether it expects non-const pointer arguments (e.g. it may cast away const) or otherwise forces non-const usage of path or lfs; also to verify that the use of (void*)lfs and path in the trace does not violate const-correctness.\\n\nCollectively these symbols let the analyst determine whether any pointer parameters or members used in lfs_remove should be const-qualified (or are forced to be non-const by callees/macros), which is necessary to judge compliance with the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointer types."
