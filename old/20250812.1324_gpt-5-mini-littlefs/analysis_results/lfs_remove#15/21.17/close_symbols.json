  "explanation": "- lfs_remove_: Direct callee of lfs_remove; all actual path manipulation and removal logic is inside this function. Must be analyzed to see whether any string.h functions are used on the supplied path and whether bounds are checked.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency: Called by lfs_remove_ per static call graph; may traverse filesystem metadata and could use string operations when handling names/paths; include to check for unsafe string handling.\n- lfs_dir_find: Very likely to search directory entries by name/path; high priority for analysis because it typically compares or copies names (potential use of strcmp/strncpy/strlen etc.).\n- lfs_tag_id, lfs_tag_type3: Tag parsing helpers used by directory code; may interpret bytes and construct/compare name-related fields (possible use of mem* or str*); include to ensure no out-of-bounds reads/writes.\n- lfs_dir_get: Retrieves directory entries (possibly copies names into buffers); must be checked for string copies and length checks.\n- lfs_pair_fromle32: Byte-order helper; while not a string function itself, it may be used where mem* is used to move bytes \u2014 include to inspect any uses of memcpy/memmove that could be mis-sized.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Fetches directory blocks/entries; may copy or parse names and use string functions; include to verify safe buffer bounds.\n- lfs_fs_preporphans, lfs_gstate_hasorphans, lfs_fs_pred: Filesystem consistency/orphan handling routines called during remove; they may walk metadata and manipulate names or buffers \u2014 include to ensure no hidden string.h misuse.\n- lfs_dir_commit, lfs_dir_drop: Directory modification/commit functions invoked during removal; likely to write/remove entries and may copy/shift name data \u2014 must be checked for safe use of string functions.\n- lfs_t: The filesystem main type. Its definition (including fields such as buffers, name length limits, and cfg) is needed to determine buffer sizes and invariants used by callees when copying or reading path/name data.\n- lfs->cfg (configuration structure): Configuration fields (e.g., maximum name length, buffer sizes, locking policy) are required to determine legal bounds for string operations performed in callees.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: Macros/functions used in lfs_remove; include to confirm no side effects that change buffers/paths or temporarily alter invariants used by string operations.\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro that formats the path with \"%s\". Its implementation (or expansion) must be checked to ensure it does not call unsafe string functions or cause out-of-bounds access when formatting path.\n- string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn): The MISRA rule targets these functions. Include them conceptually so the analyst inspects every occurrence of these functions in lfs_remove_ and its callees (above) to ensure lengths/limits are computed correctly and no pointer/length combinations can cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nIn short: lfs_remove itself only forwards to lfs_remove_, so the full chain of callees (listed) and the types/macros that define buffer sizes/invariants must be available, plus any occurrences of the standard string.h functions, to determine whether any string operation could access memory beyond the referenced objects."
