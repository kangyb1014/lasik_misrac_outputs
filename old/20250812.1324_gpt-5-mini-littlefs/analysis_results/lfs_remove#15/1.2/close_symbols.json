  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or inline routine used in the function prologue. Macros can expand to compiler-specific extensions (e.g. statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, __builtin_* calls). You must inspect its definition to determine whether any non-standard compiler extensions are used inside the expansion.\\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK (may be a macro/inline that uses compiler-specific extensions).\\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is invoked inside the function and almost certainly implemented as a macro (possibly variadic) or wrapper that could use compiler extensions (variadic macro extensions, __attribute__, __builtin_expect, __FUNCTION__, statement-expressions, etc.). Its definition must be checked.\\n- lfs_t (typedef/struct definition including cfg member): The function signature and the expression (void*)lfs and lfs->cfg depend on the definition of lfs_t and its cfg member type. The type or its members might carry compiler-specific attributes or use non-standard language features (packed attributes, __attribute__ annotations, extended integer types, anonymous structs/unions, etc.).\\n- lfs_remove_ (prototype/definition): The call uses this symbol; its declaration/definition could include compiler-specific extensions on the prototype (attributes, calling-convention annotations, inline/asm, or non-standard linkage) that are relevant to determining whether the codebase uses language extensions. Checking its declaration/definition is needed to fully assess compliance for the target function."
