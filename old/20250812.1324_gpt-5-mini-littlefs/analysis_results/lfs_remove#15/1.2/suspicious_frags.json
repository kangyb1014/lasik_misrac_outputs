  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specific notes:\n- The macros LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK use standard C constructs: a cast to void and the comma operator ((void)cfg, 0) and ((void)cfg) \u2014 these are standard C expressions, not compiler extensions.\n- The LFS_TRACE macro uses the variadic macro identifier __VA_ARGS__, which is part of standard C99 and later (not a compiler extension in standard-compliant compilers). Its use here is ordinary and the macro is defined with a standard form.\n- The cast (void*)lfs and use of the %p format specifier are standard C.\n- There are no uses of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly (__asm__), GNU nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords or builtins.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this code that explicitly use documented compiler language extensions that would require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
