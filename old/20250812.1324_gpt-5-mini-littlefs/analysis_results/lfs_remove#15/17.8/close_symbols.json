  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: Appears as a macro/function-like call in the target. If LFS_LOCK is a macro (or a function-like macro) it can expand into statements that might reassign or otherwise modify the local parameter variables (for example, by name collisions). To prove the target function does not modify its pointer parameters you must inspect the LFS_LOCK definition. If it is a function, its prototype is still needed to confirm it cannot alter the pointer variables in-scope via macro expansion.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 it may be a macro whose expansion could modify local names, or a function-like macro with side-effects; its definition/prototype is needed to ensure no assignments to the parameter variables occur.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This is used with (void*)lfs and path. LFS_TRACE is commonly a macro for logging; if it is a macro its expansion could contain code that (re)uses or assigns to identifiers such as lfs or path. Inspecting its definition guarantees the trace invocation does not modify the pointer parameters.\n\n- lfs_remove_: This is the only direct callee. If lfs_remove_ is implemented as a macro (or inline macro-like expansion) rather than a normal function, it could expand into code that modifies the local parameter variables. To be sure the target function does not modify its parameter variables you must examine lfs_remove_\u2019s definition (or prototype if it is a normal function) to determine whether it is a macro expansion or contains any assignments to the parameter identifiers.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition): The parameter type and its member cfg are used in the calls (lfs->cfg). Having the lfs_t typedef/struct definition and the type of cfg ensures that expressions like lfs->cfg are ordinary member accesses and helps rule out unusual macro/typedef tricks that could cause the parameter identifier to be redefined/aliased. It also helps confirm that passing (void*)lfs to LFS_TRACE can't implicitly alter the pointer variable via an unexpected type definition.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule at issue concerns modification of the parameter variables themselves (the pointer variables). The primary risk in this function is that any of the above symbols might actually be macros that expand inline and contain assignments to the parameter identifiers; thus each symbol\u2019s definition (macro body or function prototype/definition, and the lfs_t definition) is required for a sound determination."
