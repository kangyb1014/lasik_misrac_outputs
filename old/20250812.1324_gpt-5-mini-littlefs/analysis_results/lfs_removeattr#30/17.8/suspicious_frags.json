  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Details:\n- In lfs_removeattr, the parameters lfs, path and type are only read: lfs is dereferenced to access lfs->cfg (no assignment to the parameter variable), path is passed to LFS_TRACE and forwarded to lfs_removeattr_, and type is passed/printed; there are no statements that assign to or rebind these parameters.\n- The helper lfs_removeattr_ likewise only forwards its parameters to lfs_commitattr and returns; it performs no assignment to lfs, path or type.\n- The macros LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK expand to ((void)cfg,0) and ((void)cfg) respectively, which only evaluate cfg (and discard it) and do not modify the argument. LFS_TRACE is empty.\n- path is declared as const char * (so cannot be modified through this pointer), and type is passed by value (uint8_t) and never assigned to.\nTherefore, there are no code fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the supplied code."
