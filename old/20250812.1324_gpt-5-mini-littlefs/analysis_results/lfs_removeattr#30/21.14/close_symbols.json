  "explanation": "- lfs_removeattr_: This is the direct callee of the target function. Any use of memcmp to compare strings might occur here (or it may pass the path or other char* on to other helpers). You must inspect its body to see whether memcmp is used on null-terminated strings or whether it computes a byte length to pass to memcmp.\n- lfs_commitattr: Static call graph shows lfs_removeattr_ calls lfs_commitattr. memcmp usage could be in this downstream function, so its definition is required to detect prohibited memcmp-on-NT-strings patterns.\n- memcmp: The standard function itself (prototype) must be recognized so calls can be identified. You need to examine call sites to see the arguments and length parameter passed to memcmp to decide if it is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- strlen: Commonly used to compute lengths when developers wrongly combine strlen with memcmp (e.g. memcmp(a,b,strlen(a))). If a strlen (or equivalent) is used to produce the length argument, that is relevant to deciding a MISRA violation.\n\nNote: If lfs_removeattr_ or lfs_commitattr call other helper functions that perform comparisons, include those helper function definitions as well. LFS_* logging/locking macros are not relevant to detecting memcmp-on-null-terminated-string usage unless they expand to code that performs such comparisons."
