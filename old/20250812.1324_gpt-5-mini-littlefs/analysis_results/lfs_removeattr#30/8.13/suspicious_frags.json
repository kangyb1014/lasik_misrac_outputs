  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because they do not present non-const pointer declarations that could be considered for Rule 8.13: - The parameter 'const char *path' is already const-qualified. - The member 'const struct lfs_config *cfg' is already const-qualified. - Remaining members shown (arrays, scalar types, and named struct values like rcache/pcache/root/seed/gstate/gdisk/gdelta and size_t fields) are not pointer declarations and thus not relevant to the pointer const-qualification requirement. - Uses of pointers (e.g., lfs->cfg in calls) are expressions, not pointer type declarations; the rule targets pointer types that should be const-qualified whenever possible."
