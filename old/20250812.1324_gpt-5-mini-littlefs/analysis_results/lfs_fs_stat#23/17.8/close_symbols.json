  "explanation": "You must inspect any macros/functions that are invoked in the body (and the relevant types) because the MISRA rule forbids modifying function parameter variables themselves. Brief reasons for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or function-like macro invoked with the expression lfs->cfg. If it is a macro (textual expansion) it could contain code that assigns to identifiers visible in the caller scope. We need the exact definition to prove it does not reassign the parameter variable lfs (or otherwise modify the parameter object lfs or its name in the caller function).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion/definition must be checked for any assignments or side effects that could modify the parameter variable lfs.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function is called with (void*)lfs and (void*)fsinfo. Although traces usually do not write back to parameters, a macro expansion could reference or modify identifiers in the caller scope. Include its definition to confirm it does not modify the pointer parameters.\n\n- lfs_fs_stat_: The callee is invoked with the fsinfo pointer. If lfs_fs_stat_ is a macro or an inline function, its expansion could modify identifiers in the caller scope. Even if it is a normal function, we still want its declaration/body to confirm it is not a macro that rebinds or assigns the parameter variables of lfs_fs_stat.\n\n- type definition of lfs_t: The code accesses lfs->cfg. Knowing the layout of lfs_t (and whether any operators or overloaded macros are used) is necessary to determine whether member access or expressions could invoke side effects that reassign the lfs parameter variable.\n\n- definition of struct lfs_fsinfo: fsinfo is passed to routines and cast to (void*). Having the struct definition confirms whether any macros/functions accessing fsinfo could rely on unusual definitions that affect the parameter variable itself.\n\n- definition/type of the lfs->cfg member (cfg field): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg. The exact type and any associated macros or inline helpers for that member must be checked to ensure no indirect macro expands to an assignment to the lfs variable or otherwise rebind the parameter.\n\nIn short: inspect the textual definitions of all macros/functions called in the body (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE, lfs_fs_stat_) and the relevant types (lfs_t, struct lfs_fsinfo, and the cfg member type) to conclusively determine whether the function's parameter variables (lfs and fsinfo) are ever modified."
