  "explanation": "I examined the provided function lfs_fs_stat, its call sites, and the related macro definitions shown. I did not find any use of compiler-specific language extensions (such as GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords). Specific notes:\n\n- LFS_LOCK(cfg) defined as ((void)cfg,0) uses the comma operator and a (void) cast; both are standard C and not compiler extensions.\n- LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) defined as ((void)cfg) uses a (void) cast; this is standard C.\n- LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) is a variadic macro; variadic macros are part of standard C since C99, not a compiler extension. Its use in the code (LFS_TRACE(\"...\", (void*)lfs, (void*)fsinfo)) is standard.\n- Pointer casts like (void*)lfs are standard C.\n- Control flow, returns, and local variables use only standard constructs.\n\nThe only symbols not fully expanded in the supplied snippets are macros/types such as LFS_MKTAG, LFS_TYPE_INLINESTRUCT, lfs_t, lfs_fsinfo, and related functions (lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, etc.). If any of those unseen macro definitions or function implementations use compiler-specific extensions, they would need separate review; but based on the code you provided, there are no explicit uses of documented compiler language extensions to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
