  "explanation": "You must inspect not only lfs_fs_stat itself but its direct callee lfs_fs_stat_ and the functions it calls because the MISRA rule targets use of string.h functions (memcpy, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and any of those may appear in the transitive callees or depend on structure/layout information to determine pointer/buffer bounds. For each symbol:\n\n- lfs_fs_stat_: direct callee of the target; it may perform operations (copies, comparisons, conversions) that use string.h routines or that pass pointers and lengths, so its body must be inspected.\n- lfs_gstate_needssuperblock: called by lfs_fs_stat_; could examine/compare superblock bytes or state and therefore may call memcmp/memcpy or similar.\n- lfs_fs_disk_version: converts or reads version fields from on-disk data; might use memcpy/memcmp or byte-wise reads that affect pointer bounds reasoning.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: directory fetching routine \u2014 likely reads directory entries into buffers and may use memcpy/memset/strncpy/etc.; must be inspected for out-of-bounds accesses and for the sizes of destination buffers.\n- lfs_dir_get: gets a directory entry (e.g. name, metadata) \u2014 very likely to copy name strings or entry data and therefore a prime candidate for string.h use and bounds checks.\n- lfs_superblock_fromle32: converts superblock fields from little-endian; may perform byte-wise copies or rely on buffer layouts \u2014 needed to determine the sizes and valid ranges of data accessed.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: the target calls these macros/functions; include their definitions to ensure they don't themselves use string.h functions or manipulate pointers that affect analysis (typically synchronization but must be ruled out).\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro/function used in the target \u2014 include to check whether it calls any string.h functions (e.g. internal formatting helpers) that could violate the rule or mask pointer usage.\n- lfs_t (type / struct definition): lfs_fs_stat accesses lfs->cfg; the layout of lfs_t (and nested config) is needed to know buffer sizes and pointer validity for any pointer passed to callees.\n- struct lfs_fsinfo (definition): the second parameter is populated/used by callees; its fields and sizes are needed to determine whether copies into it might overflow.\n- struct lfs_superblock (or layout): used by superblock conversion and by callers; needed to understand the size and layout of on-disk data and any byte-wise copies.\n- directory/dir-entry types (e.g. lfs_dir_t, lfs_direntry): used by lfs_dir_fetch / lfs_dir_get \u2014 these definitions provide sizes and buffer member lengths required to reason about safe use of memcpy/strncpy/etc.\n- any buffer / block device read APIs used transitively: lfs_dir_fetch and other functions will read raw blocks into buffers; those APIs and their buffer semantics (destination sizes, offsets) are necessary to verify that subsequent string.h calls do not access out-of-bounds memory.\n\nIn short: include lfs_fs_stat_'s implementation and all directly-called functions and the struct/type definitions they operate on (superblock, dir entries, lfs_t, lfs_fsinfo), plus the lock/trace macros. With those symbols the next analyst can locate any uses of string.h functions, see the sizes/lengths of source and destination buffers, and determine whether any call can access beyond object bounds."
