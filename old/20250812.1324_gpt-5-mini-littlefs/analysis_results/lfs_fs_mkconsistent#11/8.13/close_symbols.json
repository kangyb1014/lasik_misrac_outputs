  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: must know the prototype (parameter qualifiers) to see whether the callee requires a mutable lfs_t*; if the callee takes a non-const lfs_t* then the caller cannot reasonably make its lfs argument const.\n- lfs_t: the full struct/type definition is required to determine whether the lfs pointer itself or any accessed members are const-qualified and whether members are modified; it reveals the type of the cfg field and other fields that might require mutability.\n- type of lfs->cfg (e.g. lfs_cfg_t or struct lfs_config): LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg. To decide if cfg could be a pointer-to-const, we need the exact cfg type and its const-qualification.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function prototype): its parameter type determines whether it requires a non-const cfg pointer (forcing cfg and potentially lfs to be non-const). If it is a macro, its expansion may also access or modify the pointer.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function prototype): same reason as LFS_LOCK\u2014its signature/expansion may require a mutable cfg pointer.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro definition): the logging macro's definition may impose type requirements (casts, side-effects) or expect non-const pointers; must inspect to ensure passing (void*)lfs is not masking a const-qualification issue.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether the lfs pointer (and its cfg member) could/should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule, and whether any called macros/functions force non-const usage."
