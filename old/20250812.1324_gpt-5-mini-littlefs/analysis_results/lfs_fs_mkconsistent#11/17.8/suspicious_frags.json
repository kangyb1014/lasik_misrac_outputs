  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies a function parameter itself. In lfs_fs_mkconsistent and lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ the parameter is lfs_t *lfs and there are no assignments to lfs (no reassignments like lfs = ...). All uses are either: (1) passing the pointer to other functions, which is permitted, (2) accessing or taking the address of subobjects (e.g., &lfs->gdisk, lfs->root), which may modify the object pointed to (allowed by Rule 17.8), or (3) passing lfs->cfg to macros. The provided macro definitions (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE) do not modify their argument (they evaluate it or cast it to void), so they do not modify the parameter pointer. Local variables (err, delta, root) are assigned, which is allowed. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for a potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
