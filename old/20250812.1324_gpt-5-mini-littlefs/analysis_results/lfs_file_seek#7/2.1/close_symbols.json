  "explanation": "To decide whether any statement in lfs_file_seek is syntactically/semantically unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) we must inspect the actual definitions/expansions that can change control flow:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: this macro/function is called at the top and its return is tested. If LFS_LOCK can itself contain non\u2011local control flow (longjmp/abort/return) or if its return type/semantics force a compile\u2011time constant, that affects whether subsequent code is ever reached. Provide its definition/signature.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: called near the end. If LFS_UNLOCK is defined to not return or to contain control flow that precludes following statements, that could make later code unreachable. Provide its definition.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: used twice. Some trace macros expand to nothing, to inline calls, or to calls that may not return (rare but possible). Its expansion determines whether the trace statements are ordinary calls or introduce unreachable code. Provide its macro/definition.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: wraps lfs_mlist_isopen. ASSERT macros sometimes expand to abort/exit/longjmp when the condition fails, which could make code following the assert unreachable in all builds (or unreachable in certain build configurations). To decide syntactic/semantic unreachability we need the exact expansion.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: used as the asserted condition. If this is a macro or inline that itself contains control flow (e.g., always false/true, or triggers side effects), it may affect reachability of following code. Provide its definition.\n\n- lfs_file_seek_: the function this wrapper calls and assigns to res. If lfs_file_seek_ is defined with noreturn semantics (e.g., always longjmp/abort), the trace/unlock/return after the call would be unreachable. Provide its full definition/signature and any attributes (noreturn).\n\n- struct lfs_t (definition): the code passes lfs->cfg to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; the concrete type/fields (cfg) and any associated inline helpers/macros may affect how LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK expand or behave. Include struct lfs_t so macros that inspect cfg can be understood.\n\nProviding these symbols (macro expansions and function definitions) allows the analyzer to determine whether any statement in lfs_file_seek can never be executed under any possible build/configuration, which is required to determine compliance with the MISRA unreachable\u2011code rule."
