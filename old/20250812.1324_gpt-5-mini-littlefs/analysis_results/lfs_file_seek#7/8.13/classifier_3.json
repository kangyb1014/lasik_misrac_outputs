  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in this code. The 'next' member is a pointer to a mutable lfs_file node in a linked list and the object it points to is intended to be modified (linked-list manipulation and file state updates). Rule 8.13 requires adding const only when the pointed-to object is never modified; here the design implies mutability, so making it 'const struct lfs_file *next' would be incorrect. (If, however, the implementation never writes through 'next' and only ever reads it, then the correct declaration would be 'const struct lfs_file *next' and the current code would violate Rule 8.13.)"
