  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not present pointer-to-non-const concerns relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: numeric parameters (off, whence), local scalar variables (err, res), macro locking/unlocking invocations (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK) and trace macros that only take void* for logging of addresses are not pointers that should be converted to point-to-const. The struct member cfg in lfs_file_t is already declared as a pointer-to-const (const struct lfs_file_config *cfg), so it does not need investigation. Other members shown (integer types, embedded structs, cache object) are non-pointer types or already appropriately qualified and therefore are not suspicious for this rule."
