  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameters of lfs_file_seek (lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) could/should be const, the analyzer must know whether those pointed-to objects are ever modified by this function or by callees it forwards them to, and whether calling conventions require non-const access. Concretely:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration/prototype): lfs_file_seek calls lfs_mlist_isopen((struct lfs_mlist*)file). The signature shows whether it takes a pointer-to-const or non-const struct lfs_mlist; if it requires a non-const pointer then file cannot be const in lfs_file_seek (or the cast would be hiding a const violation).\n\n- lfs_file_seek_ (declaration/prototype): lfs_file_seek simply forwards file and lfs to lfs_file_seek_. If lfs_file_seek_ requires non-const pointers (and/or modifies pointed data), then lfs_file_seek[']s parameters cannot be const. The prototype reveals that requirement.\n\n- typedef/definition of lfs_file_t: to determine the actual pointed type and whether it is compatible with struct lfs_mlist (the code casts file to struct lfs_mlist*). The declaration shows if lfs_file_t is an alias for a modifiable structure or should be const.\n\n- definition of struct lfs_mlist: to know whether the operations performed by callees (and the cast here) would allow const qualification, and to check if lfs_mlist_isopen legitimately could/should accept a const pointer.\n\n- typedef/definition of lfs_t (including member cfg): making lfs a const pointer would also const-qualify its members; the analyzer needs the struct layout (member cfg type) to see whether subsequent calls from this function (notably LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK) require non-const access to members of lfs. If LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK expect non-const cfg, lfs cannot be const-qualified without further changes.\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macros or function prototypes): these are invoked on lfs->cfg. Their signatures determine whether passing a const-qualified lfs (which makes lfs->cfg const) would be type-correct. If they take non-const cfg pointers (or mutate cfg), lfs cannot be made const.\n\n(Other macros like LFS_TRACE and LFS_ASSERT only log/check and do not affect whether the pointed-to objects can be const in this function; the above symbols are the ones required to assess MISRA C const-qualification for the function parameters.)"
