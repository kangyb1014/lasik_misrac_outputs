  "explanation": "I found no assignments that modify function parameter variables themselves. All writes are to objects pointed to by pointer parameters (e.g., file->pos, file->off), which is permitted by the rule. Pointer parameters are never reassigned (no statements like lfs = ..., file = ..., head = ...). The use of &head in lfs_mlist_isopen only takes the address of the local parameter and then walks next pointers via p; it does not assign to *p or head. The compound literal addresses (e.g., &(lfs_off_t){file->pos}) create temporary objects and do not modify any parameter variables. The macros LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE/LFS_ASSERT expand to expressions that do not modify the parameter variables. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs to be investigated for this rule."
