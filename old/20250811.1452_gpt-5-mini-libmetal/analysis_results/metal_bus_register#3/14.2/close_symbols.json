Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether metal_bus_register violates the MISRA C for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness rule you must determine whether any for loops (and their loop counters/flags) are present or implied by functions/macros called from this function and whether those loops use or are affected by objects modified in metal_bus_register. The following symbols are therefore needed:\n\n- struct metal_bus (full definition): metal_bus_register accesses bus->name, bus->devices and bus->node. You must know the types/layout to see if any of these objects are or alias loop counters/flags used in callee for loops, or are modified inside called routines.\n\n- metal_bus_find (full definition): called from the second if. If this function contains a for loop, its loop controller or body may use or modify objects visible to the caller; its implementation is needed to judge whether any for loop within it violates the MISRA constraints when considered in the calling context.\n\n- metal_list_init (full definition or macro expansion): called to initialize bus->devices. If this is a macro or function containing a for loop (or modifies objects that could act as loop counters/flags), its code is necessary to inspect for MISRA rule compliance.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (full definition or macro expansion): called with &_metal.common.bus_list and &bus->node. This routine (or macro) is a prime candidate to contain list traversal loops. You must inspect its for loops to ensure loop counters/flags are local, not modified outside the loop body, and that it does not rely on objects that are modified by metal_bus_register.\n\n- struct/list node types used by metal_list_* (e.g. metal_list, metal_node definitions): to understand what objects metal_list_add_tail and metal_list_init manipulate; to check whether any identifier used as a loop counter/flag in their loops could be an object that metal_bus_register modifies.\n\n- _metal (global) and type/definition of _metal.common.bus_list: passed into metal_list_add_tail; you must know whether this global is used in for loop headers or modified by the caller, and whether its fields could serve as loop counters/flags in callee loops.\n\n- strlen (declaration/implementation, normally <string.h>): called in the conditional. Although unlikely, if a nonstandard strlen is used that contains problematic for loops or has side effects relevant to MISRA clause 2, its behavior must be known. At minimum the prototype confirms it has no persistent side effects.\n\n- metal_log (declaration/definition): called at end; if this routine contains for loops, their compliance must be checked (and whether they use/modify objects visible to metal_bus_register).\n\nCollecting the full definitions/prototypes (or macro expansions) for the above symbols lets the next analyzer inspect any for statements present in callees/macros and determine whether any loop counters or flags violate MISRA requirements when considered in the calling context of metal_bus_register."
