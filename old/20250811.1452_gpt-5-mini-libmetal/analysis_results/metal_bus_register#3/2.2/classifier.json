  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_bus_register code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/26.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_bus_register as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_bus_register:\n```c\nint metal_bus_register(struct metal_bus *bus)\n{\n\tif (!bus || !bus->name || !strlen(bus->name))\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\tif (metal_bus_find(bus->name, NULL) == 0)\n\t\treturn -EEXIST;\n\tmetal_list_init(&bus->devices);\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.bus_list, &bus->node);\n\tmetal_log(METAL_LOG_DEBUG, \"registered %s bus\\n\", bus->name);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_bus_register code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Each statement in metal_bus_register has observable effect: the input validation and strlen call determine error returns; metal_bus_find enforces uniqueness; metal_list_init and metal_list_add_tail modify bus and global lists; metal_log produces observable output (and may affect timing). Removing any of these operations would change program behaviour, so there is no dead code here.",
