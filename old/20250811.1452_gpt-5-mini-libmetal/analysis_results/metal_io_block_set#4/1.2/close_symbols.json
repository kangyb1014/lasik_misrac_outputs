  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed:\n- metal_io_virt: the function is called at the start; inspect its implementation to ensure it does not use compiler-specific extensions (builtins, inline asm, attributes) or return a nonstandard pointer type that would make this code rely on an extension.\n- struct metal_io_region: the structure definition (types of members) is required to check whether used member types (e.g. io->size) or layout rely on nonstandard extensions (bitfields, packed attributes, nonportable types) and to confirm sizeof/alignment assumptions.\n- struct metal_io_region::ops (and ops.block_set prototype): block_set is invoked (if present). Its declaration may use nonstandard calling conventions, attributes, or compiler extensions; the prototype is necessary to determine whether use of block_set is standard C or an extension.\n- atomic_thread_fence: this identifier may be a macro or builtin that maps to compiler-specific intrinsics; its definition is needed to tell whether the code uses a standard C11 atomic or a compiler extension.\n- memory_order_seq_cst: this memory-order enumerator/macro comes from the atomics API; its origin/definition must be checked to determine if C11 atomic semantics are used or if a compiler-specific substitute/extension is in play.\n- uintptr_t: the integer pointer type is usually from <stdint.h>; confirm its definition (and existence) to ensure it is standard on the target compiler and not a compiler-specific typedef/extension.\n- CHAR_BIT: used to compute shifts; include its definition (from <limits.h>) to confirm standard usage and that the code does not rely on an implementation-specific value or extension.\n- ERANGE: errno macro used in return; its definition (from <errno.h>) is required to confirm standard error reporting and that no nonstandard error code or extension is being used.\n\nProviding these symbols (and their headers/definitions) lets the analyst determine whether the target function relies on language/compiler extensions (for example nonstandard atomics, builtins, attributes, or inline assembly) and thus whether it violates the MISRA rule banning language extensions."
