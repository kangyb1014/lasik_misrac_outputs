  "explanation": "- strlen: The target calls strlen() to validate bus_name and dev_name. Its presence is needed to confirm the code uses length checks rather than string comparisons and to reason about null-terminated string handling in this function.  \n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. To determine a violation you must know whether memcmp is called anywhere in this function or in functions it invokes (directly or via the ops pointer). Include memcmp to detect such uses.  \n- metal_bus_find: This function is called by the target. Its implementation must be examined for any use of memcmp (or other string comparison on NUL-terminated strings). The static call graph already shows it as a callee, so its definition is required.  \n- struct metal_bus: The code dereferences bus and accesses bus->ops; the struct definition is required to locate the ops field and confirm types and semantics.  \n- struct metal_bus::ops (metal_bus_ops): The ops field type (the ops structure) is required to know the prototype and name of dev_open and to locate where implementations of dev_open are defined/assigned. Those implementations may use memcmp incorrectly.  \n- dev_open implementations (functions assigned to metal_bus->ops.dev_open): The target calls bus->ops.dev_open via a function pointer. Any function assigned here must be inspected for memcmp usage on null-terminated strings; therefore the concrete dev_open implementations are required for analysis.  \n- struct metal_device: The target passes a metal_device** to dev_open; the type is included to fully understand dev_open prototype and whether string arguments are forwarded or compared there.\n\nCollectively, these symbols allow a reviewer to trace any memcmp usage reachable from metal_device_open (directly in this function, in metal_bus_find, or in any dev_open implementation invoked through the ops pointer) and so determine whether the MISRA prohibition is violated."
