  "explanation": "To decide whether the parameter 'struct metal_device **device' should be const-qualified (MISRA: prefer const whenever possible) we must know whether the function or callees are allowed/expected to modify the object pointed to. Each listed symbol is needed for that determination:\n\n- struct metal_device\n  - Needed to see whether the pointed-to object is conceptually mutable or contains const members that would require const qualification. Also to know if caller is expected to receive a newly-initialized/modified metal_device instance.\n\n- struct metal_bus\n  - Required because metal_device_open dereferences 'bus' (bus->ops). Knowing the bus layout lets us locate the ops field and its types.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (type of bus->ops) including dev_open declaration\n  - The ops structure contains the dev_open member; its declared type tells whether dev_open accepts a 'struct metal_device **', 'const struct metal_device **', or some other const-qualification. That directly affects whether device should be const-qualified in metal_device_open.\n\n- prototype/declaration of dev_open function pointer (signature)\n  - The exact parameter types of dev_open (e.g., whether it takes struct metal_device **device or const struct metal_device **device or struct metal_device * const *device) determine whether dev_open will modify the pointer value and/or the object pointed to. This is the crucial symbol for deciding const-correctness of the 'device' parameter in metal_device_open.\n\n- metal_bus_find prototype\n  - metal_device_open calls metal_bus_find and receives a struct metal_bus*. The prototype shows whether metal_bus_find can return a bus whose ops and dev_open signatures are as declared (and whether any qualifiers are involved). Also needed to validate that bus->ops is the expected ops type.\n\n- implementations of dev_open used by registered buses (concrete dev_open functions)\n  - Even if the dev_open function pointer type is non-const, concrete implementations may or may not modify the *device object. Inspecting implementations verifies actual behavior (whether they write into *device or modify the pointed-to metal_device). This runtime behavior influences whether the pointer must be non-const by MISRA rules.\n\n(Other symbols like strlen or error macros are not needed to assess const-correctness of the 'device' pointer.)"
