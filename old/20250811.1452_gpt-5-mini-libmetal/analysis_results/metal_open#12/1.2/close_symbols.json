  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions/declarations of these symbols to decide whether the target uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA: language extensions forbidden). For each symbol check whether it is implemented using compiler-specific language extensions (e.g. uses keywords such as __attribute__, typeof, __extension__, built\u2011in functions, inline assembly, compiler\u2011specific macros or tokens) rather than plain standard C/library definitions. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- O_RDWR, O_CREAT, O_CLOEXEC: these are file\u2011flag macros (usually from <fcntl.h>). Macros can hide compiler extensions (e.g. defined via other compiler-specific macros or use compiler built\u2011ins). O_CLOEXEC in particular is platform/GNU specific on some systems \u2014 verify it is a simple integer macro, not an extension that injects compiler-specific tokens.\n\n- S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR: permission\u2011mode macros (from <sys/stat.h>). As macros they could expand to implementation\u2011specific expressions; inspect for any use of compiler extensions.\n\n- shm_open: POSIX/shared memory function. Confirm its declaration/definition is a normal library prototype (not a compiler built\u2011in or a macro that expands to compiler\u2011specific code). Also check which header declares it (feature test macros may be required) but the key is whether its symbol involves language extensions.\n\n- open: standard system call wrapper. Check its prototype/macros (sometimes open is a macro alias to open64 or other wrappers); ensure it is not defined via compiler extensions.\n\n- strlen: standard C library function. Inspect its declaration and any possible inline/macro implementation shipped with the platform that might use compiler extensions (e.g. GCC built\u2011ins, inline assembly or typeof tricks).\n\n- errno: typically a macro that may expand to a function or thread\u2011local accessor (often implemented via compiler macros). Inspect its definition to ensure it does not rely on compiler extensions beyond standard C (MISRA cares about language/compiler extensions used in code via such macros).\n\n- EINVAL: error code macro (from <errno.h>). As with other macros, verify its definition is a plain integer constant and not implemented via compiler\u2011specific constructs.\n\n- size_t: used in prototypes (strlen). Verify the type is the standard typedef from <stddef.h>/<string.h> and not a compiler extension.\n\nIn short: examine the header declarations/definitions (headers involved: <fcntl.h>, <sys/stat.h>, <string.h>, <errno.h>, the header providing shm_open on the target platform) for these symbols to determine whether any of them are implemented using compiler language extensions. Only if such extensions appear in those symbol definitions should the MISRA rule be reported violated."
