  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_open code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/99.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_open as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_open:\n```c\nint metal_open(const char *path, int shm)\n{\n\tconst int flags = O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_CLOEXEC;\n\tconst int mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR;\n\tint fd;\n\n\tif (!path || !strlen(path))\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\n\tfd = shm ? shm_open(path, flags, mode) : open(path, flags, mode);\n\treturn fd < 0 ? -errno : fd;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_open code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The parameter path is declared as const char * and the function does not modify the pointed-to object. The code only tests path for NULL/empty and calls strlen and either shm_open or open, both of which accept const char * for the pathname. There is no cast to remove const nor any modification through the pointer, so Rule 8.13 is satisfied.",
