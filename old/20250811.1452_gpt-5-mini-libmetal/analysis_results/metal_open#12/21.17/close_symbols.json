  "explanation": "You must determine whether the call strlen(path) can read beyond the bounds of the object referenced by path (MISRA: string functions must not access past object bounds). For that you need the following symbols:\n\n- strlen: The standard function itself \u2014 its semantics (reads bytes until a NUL terminator) are the direct source of potential out-of-bounds access. Include its prototype/standard behavior so the analyzer can reason about its read-until-NUL precondition.\n\n- metal_uio_dev_open: A direct caller of metal_open. To prove safety you must inspect how metal_uio_dev_open constructs, validates or obtains the path pointer passed into metal_open (allocation, lifetime, guaranteed NUL-termination, empty-string handling, checks against NULL).\n\n- metal_uio_read_map_attr: Called by metal_uio_dev_open and likely involved in reading/producing attribute strings or names used as path. If it builds or returns a buffer used as path, its implementation determines whether that buffer is NUL-terminated and sized correctly.\n\n- metal_map: Also called by metal_uio_dev_open; included because it may produce or transform mapping names/paths or buffers that ultimately become the path argument. Its behavior can affect whether path is a valid, NUL-terminated string.\n\n- metal_shmem_open: Another direct caller of metal_open. You must inspect how it obtains or constructs its path argument (validation, guarantees of termination, ownership and buffer size) to ensure strlen won't read out of bounds.\n\n- metal_shmem_open_generic: Called by metal_shmem_open; may allocate or format the shared-memory name/path. Its implementation may contain string operations (snprintf/strcpy/etc.) or buffer allocations that determine whether the returned path is NUL-terminated and within bounds.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: Also called by metal_shmem_open; it may construct or manipulate path-like strings or map names. Its behavior can affect path validity and termination.\n\n- shmem_child: Listed as a caller of metal_shmem_open in the call graph. Include it to trace the original source of the path (how the argument is passed down) and any checks done before calling metal_shmem_open.\n\nIn short: include strlen (to reason about its read-until-NUL requirement) and the callers plus any helper functions that create or return the path string so you can trace the origin, allocation, size, and validation of the buffer passed as path. This is necessary to determine whether strlen(path) can legally access the object pointed to, or whether it may run past its bounds (a MISRA violation)."
