  "explanation": "struct linux_bus: Required to know the exact type and const-qualification of the member bus_name (e.g. whether bus_name is declared as char * or const char *). The MISRA rule requires pointers to be const-qualified when possible; determining whether lbus could/should be a pointer-to-const depends on the bus structure member types and whether lbus is modified.\n\nstruct linux_driver: Required to inspect the types and const-qualification of drv_name, mod_name and sdrv. The function reads drv_name/mod_name and writes ldrv->sdrv; to check MISRA compliance we must know whether these members are declared const-qualified (or could be) and the type of sdrv.\n\nsysfs_open_driver: The prototype is needed to know the parameter types (does it take const char *bus_name, const char *drv_name or non-const pointers?) and the return type. That tells us whether passing lbus->bus_name and ldrv->drv_name violates const-qualification expectations or whether sysfs_open_driver could modify the passed strings.\n\nstruct sysfs_driver: The concrete type of sdrv (the object pointed to by ldrv->sdrv) is required to determine whether sdrv should be a pointer-to-const (i.e. whether the pointed-to object is immutable) and whether other code/functions might modify the object (which would make a const pointer inappropriate).\n\nsnprintf: The prototype (particularly the type of the format and variadic %s handling) is needed to confirm whether passing ldrv->mod_name to snprintf is compatible with const qualification of mod_name and whether any implicit/unsafe conversions occur that relate to const correctness.\n\nsystem: Its prototype/semantics are needed only to confirm it does not modify the strings passed (it takes a const char * command) and thus does not force non-const qualification of command or its contents.\n\nmetal_log: The logging function prototype is required to see whether it takes const char * parameters (so passing __func__ and command is const-correct) and to ensure logging does not require non-const pointers.\n\nMETAL_LOG_WARNING: The logging-level macro is included because it is an argument to metal_log; knowing whether it expands to something that affects const-correctness or macro side-effects helps ensure the log call does not imply modification of string arguments.\n\n(These symbols together allow checking: which pointer members are declared const, whether this function or callees modify pointed-to objects, and whether pointers could/should be const-qualified per the MISRA rule.)"
