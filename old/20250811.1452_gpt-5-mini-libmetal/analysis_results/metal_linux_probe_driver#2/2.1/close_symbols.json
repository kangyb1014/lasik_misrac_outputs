  "explanation": "For determining whether any branch or statement inside metal_linux_probe_driver is provably unreachable, the analyzer must know the declarations and semantics of all external symbols and the caller that affect runtime values and control flow:\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition; must include member: bus_name): The function reads lbus->bus_name to call sysfs_open_driver. The concrete layout and the fact that bus_name is valid are necessary to know whether the call is well-formed and whether any preconditions make later branches unreachable.\n\n- struct linux_driver (definition; must include members: sdrv, drv_name, mod_name): ldrv->sdrv is tested and updated; drv_name and mod_name are used to form commands. Knowing these members (their types and possible initial values set by callers) is required to reason about whether the initial if (!ldrv->sdrv) branches can ever be taken.\n\n- metal_linux_probe_bus (caller of metal_linux_probe_driver): The caller may initialize or set ldrv->sdrv before calling this probe. To prove a branch in the callee is unreachable, the analyzer must inspect the caller(s) to see if they guarantee ldrv->sdrv is non-NULL on entry.\n\n- void *sysfs_open_driver(const char *bus_name, const char *drv_name) (prototype and semantic): The function is called repeatedly to open the driver and its return (NULL vs non-NULL) directly controls the branching. The analysis needs the possible return values and any side effects (e.g., deterministic success/failure) to determine reachability of the probe/retry blocks.\n\n- int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...) (standard return-value semantics): The code checks the return against sizeof(command) and may return -EOVERFLOW. The static analyzer needs to know snprintf's guaranteed return behavior (how it reports truncation, negative on encoding errors, range of return values) to decide whether the overflow check can ever be true or is unreachable.\n\n- int system(const char *command) (POSIX semantics: returns -1 on failure / wait status on success): system() return is tested for < 0 to decide logging; understanding possible return values is necessary to know whether the metal_log call can be reached.\n\n- void metal_log(int level, const char *fmt, ...) and METAL_LOG_WARNING: The logging call is an observable statement inside an error path. To decide if that statement is unreachable, the analyzer must know whether the conditions that cause system() to return < 0 are possible; the metal_log symbol itself must be available to include that statement in reachability analysis.\n\n- EOVERFLOW and ENODEV (errno macros): These macros are used in return statements. To reason about the control-flow outcomes and whether returns are reachable, their presence and values are needed (mainly for completeness of semantic model).\n\n- __func__ (function-name identifier macro): Used in the metal_log format string; included for completeness since it appears in the logged branch. \n\nTogether these symbols provide the necessary type information, caller context, and function return semantics to determine whether either of the \"if (!ldrv->sdrv)\" blocks, the snprintf overflow return, the metal_log calls, or the final -ENODEV return are provably unreachable under all feasible executions."
