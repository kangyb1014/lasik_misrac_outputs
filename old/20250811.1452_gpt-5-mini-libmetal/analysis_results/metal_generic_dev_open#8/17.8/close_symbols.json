  "explanation": "- metal_list_for_each (macro): The loop is implemented via this macro; its expansion could contain assignments or side-effects that modify local variables or parameters. Expanding it is necessary to prove it does not assign to or rebind the pointer parameters (bus, dev_name, device).\n- metal_container_of (macro): This macro computes a pointer from a list node. Its expansion must be checked to ensure it does not perform writes that could alter the pointer parameters or alias them.\n- struct metal_device: Needed to see the types of its members (especially name and node). If dev->name were e.g. char * vs const char *, that affects whether dev_name could be modified or aliased; also to ensure no surprising aliasing with the device parameter.\n- struct metal_list: The list node type and semantics determine what the iterator manipulates; required to ensure the iteration does not modify the pointer parameters.\n- _metal (global) / _metal.common.generic_device_list: The symbol being iterated must be inspected to ensure its type/expansion (or accessor macros) do not hide code that writes to the function parameters.\n- strcmp (declaration): Confirming the standard declaration/semantics shows it does not modify its string pointer arguments (and that dev_name is passed as const char * consistent with no modification).\n- metal_generic_dev_sys_open (declaration/definition): Although called with dev (not a parameter), it might be a macro or inline that expands into code touching local variables. The declaration/definition is needed to rule out any macro expansion that could modify the function's pointer parameters.\n\nChecking the expansions/definitions of these symbols lets an analyzer determine if any of them perform writes or rebinds to the parameter variables (bus, dev_name, device)."
