  "explanation": "- strcmp: The source calls strcmp. To check the MISRA rule you must know the exact implementation/definition used in this build/unit (could be the C library, an inline helper, or a macro). If that strcmp is implemented as or mapped to memcmp it would violate the rule.\\n- memcmp: If strcmp is implemented internally by calling memcmp (or if memcmp is aliased to strcmp), that is what the MISRA rule prohibits. You need the memcmp symbol/implementation to detect such usage.\\n- struct metal_bus: You must confirm the type of the member 'name' (e.g. char * or char[] and whether it is guaranteed to be null-terminated). The MISRA restriction only applies to comparing null-terminated strings; if name is not a C string, the rule may not apply.\\n- metal_container_of: The container_of macro/implementation is used to obtain the bus pointer from the list node. You need it to verify that the 'name' member referenced is indeed the struct member you inspected in struct metal_bus and not some different mapping.\\n- any preprocessor mapping/header (string.h or local headers): strcmp could be #defined to something else (for example to a memcmp-based inline). You need the header/preprocessor symbols to see such redefinitions or builtins.\\n- metal_list_for_each and struct metal_list: Include these to ensure the iteration and node-to-bus relationship are correctly understood (so the bus->name reference is valid). This helps confirm the context in which strcmp is used (string compare of a bus name) and supports the determination whether a null-terminated string comparison is being performed."
