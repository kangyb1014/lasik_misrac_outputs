  "explanation": "METAL_DMA_DEV_W: The conditional on dir controls whether metal_cache_flush is executed. To decide if the flush call is dead (removable without observable effect) you must know the value space/meaning of this constant.\n\nstruct metal_sg (definition): The function memcpy size and the subsequent cache operations operate on sg_out[i].virt and .len. You must know the layout and types of virt and len (pointer size, semantics, allowed values such as NULL or zero length) to determine whether the memcpy and cache ops have observable effects.\n\nmetal_cache_flush (prototype/implementation): Whether calling metal_cache_flush produces observable behavior (hardware state, timing side effects, I/O ordering) is central to deciding if the flush is dead. Its implementation or specification is needed to know if removing the call changes program behaviour.\n\nmetal_cache_invalidate (prototype/implementation): Same reasoning as flush. In particular, the invalidate is also called by other code (see unmap); you must know its semantics to decide whether this local invalidate is redundant or otherwise required.\n\nmetal_generic_dev_dma_unmap (prototype/implementation): The static call graph shows metal_cache_invalidate is also called by the unmap function. To determine whether the invalidate here is redundant (i.e. dead because unmap will always perform the necessary action later), you need the unmap implementation or its contract (whether unmap is always invoked, and when/what it invalidates).\n\nmemcpy (prototype/semantics regarding overlap): The code performs memcpy when sg_out != sg_in. To judge whether that copy is necessary (or removable), you need the exact behaviour of memcpy (standard) and to know whether callers may supply overlapping buffers (which would also affect correctness). If copying is only to mirror pointers and later operations don't rely on the copy, it might be dead \u2014 but that depends on memcpy semantics and caller guarantees.\n\nsg_in/sg_out aliasing and map/unmap lifecycle contract (API documentation): Whether sg_out and sg_in may alias, whether callers rely on the copy of sg entries, and whether map() and unmap() are guaranteed to be paired (and in what order) are behavioural contracts outside this function that determine if operations here are necessary or redundant. This non-code contract is required to conclude whether any executed operation is dead."
