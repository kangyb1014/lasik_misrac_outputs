  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA C const-pointer analysis:\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): The function accesses sg_in[i].virt and sg_out[i].virt and sg_out[i].len. We must know the exact types of these members (e.g., is virt declared as void * or const void *, and the type of len) to decide whether sg_in and/or sg_out should be pointers to const-qualified metal_sg and/or whether the virt pointer inside metal_sg itself should be const-qualified.\n\n- metal_cache_flush (prototype/definition): The parameter types and the implementation of this function determine whether it modifies the memory pointed to by the passed pointer. If it modifies the pointee, then the pointer passed to it (sg_out[i].virt) must not be const; if it does not, the parameter could accept a const pointer. The prototype also shows whether it already expects const.\n\n- metal_cache_invalidate (prototype/definition): Same reason as metal_cache_flush. The function is called with sg_out[i].virt; to decide whether virt (and thus metal_sg fields and sg_out/sg_in) can be const-qualified we need the signature and/or implementation to know whether the function modifies the referenced object.\n\n- memcpy prototype (from <string.h>): memcpy has the signature void *memcpy(void *dst, const void *src, size_t n). The const qualification on the source argument is the basis for determining whether sg_in can be declared as const struct metal_sg * here. Including the exact prototype confirms that sg_in is only used as a read-only source in the memcpy call.\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_W (macro definition): The conditional (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) controls whether metal_cache_flush is called. Knowing the macro (value and intended semantics) helps determine whether certain code paths cause modification semantics that prevent const-qualification (for example, if a particular direction implies writes that require non-const pointers).\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition) and struct metal_device (definition): Although the parameters bus and device are currently unused in the function, MISRA suggests qualifying pointer parameters const when possible. To determine whether they could be const-qualified in the function signature without breaking semantics, their definitions (or at least knowledge of how they are used in other code) are needed to ensure no hidden modification is required and that changing to const is compatible with callers.\n\nProvide these symbols (prototypes/definitions or implementations where relevant) so the next analyzer can determine whether pointers in metal_generic_dev_dma_map should be const-qualified or must remain non-const to satisfy the MISRA rule."
