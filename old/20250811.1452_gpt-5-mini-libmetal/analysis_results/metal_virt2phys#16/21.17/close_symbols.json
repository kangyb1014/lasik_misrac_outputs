  "explanation": "Only functions that can cause or propagate uses of <string.h> routines need inspection for this MISRA rule. The reasons each symbol is required:\n\n- strerror: The call strerror(errno) is the only direct reference to the C library string API in metal_virt2phys. To determine if the rule is violated we must inspect strerror's behavior/implementation (it returns a pointer to internal/static storage and may use string operations internally). Confirming strerror does not copy into a caller buffer or otherwise perform out-of-bounds accesses is necessary.\n\n- errno: errno is the argument passed to strerror. Knowing the possible range/values of errno in the error path helps confirm that strerror is used in a normal/specified manner (e.g., no non-standard strerror variant that indexes into an array unsafely).\n\n- metal_log: metal_log is called with the %s value returned by strerror. metal_log's implementation must be inspected to see whether it performs any string operations (e.g., copies, concatenations, use of strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strlen/strspn) that could access beyond buffer bounds when given the strerror result or the format string. If metal_log performs its own unsafe string handling, the MISRA rule could be violated even though metal_virt2phys itself does not directly call string.h functions.\n\n- _metal: The global _metal object is referenced for .pagemap_fd and .page_shift. While not directly related to string functions, confirming the declaration/type of _metal and its members ensures there are no hidden string operations or macros (for example, logging macros or accessor wrappers) that expand into string-handling calls affecting the analysis.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: The logging level macro passed to metal_log may control code paths inside metal_log (e.g., formatting, buffering). Inspecting this symbol helps ensure the invoked logging path does not trigger unsafe string handling.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any standard string.h functions are used (directly or indirectly via logging) in the execution path of metal_virt2phys and whether such uses could access memory beyond object bounds."
