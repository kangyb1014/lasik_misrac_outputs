  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n\n- _metal: The global object name starts with an underscore and could be a macro/alias or defined with compiler-specific attributes or storage-class extensions. Its definition must be checked to ensure no compiler extensions are used.\n\n- _metal.pagemap_fd: The field's type and definition (e.g., typedef, macro, or unusual attribute) could hide compiler-specific extensions; needed to confirm plain integer semantics and no extension use.\n\n- _metal.page_shift: Used in bit shifts and address calculations; its declaration (type, constness, macros) must be inspected to ensure no nonstandard attributes or extensions are present.\n\n- metal_log: This logging symbol might be a macro or implemented with compiler-specific variadic/macro extensions; its definition must be checked for language-extension usage.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: Likely a macro or enum; its definition could be implemented via nonstandard compiler constructs and must be inspected.\n\n- pread: A POSIX library call that may be provided as a macro or wrapper (e.g., aliasing to __pread64) depending on feature-test macros; check its declaration to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are required/used.\n\n- strerror: Typically a library function or macro; errno/strerror implementations sometimes use compiler-specific thread-local storage or macros \u2014 inspect to ensure no compiler extensions are required.\n\n- errno: Often a macro that may expand to thread-local or compiler-provided constructs (e.g., __errno_location()); its definition must be checked for compiler-specific extensions.\n\n- off_t: A typedef controlled by headers/feature-test macros; its definition could vary (e.g., 64-bit off_t via _FILE_OFFSET_BITS or compiler/OS-specific types) and may involve extensions \u2014 needed to verify standard usage.\n\n- uintptr_t: A stdint type; verify inclusion and that its definition is from a standards-compliant header rather than a compiler-specific typedef or extension.\n\n- uint64_t: Same rationale as uintptr_t \u2014 verify it comes from standard headers and not a compiler extension.\n\n- EINVAL: Standard errno macro, but verify header provenance and that no nonstandard extension redefines it.\n\n- ENOENT: Same as EINVAL \u2014 check definition to ensure standard usage.\n\nSummary: these symbols cover globals, types, macros and library calls referenced by the function. Inspecting their declarations/definitions is necessary to determine whether any compiler- or implementation-specific language extensions (macros, attributes, builtins, nonstandard typedefs, feature-test requirements) are being used by the target function."
