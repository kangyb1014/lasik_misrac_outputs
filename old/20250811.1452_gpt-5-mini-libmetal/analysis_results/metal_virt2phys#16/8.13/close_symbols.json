  "explanation": "- metal_shmem_try_map: Direct caller of metal_virt2phys. You must inspect its prototype and call-site(s) to see what actual arguments are passed for addr and phys (types, const-qualification, and whether the caller expects these pointers to be modified). This determines if changing addr to const void * (or phys to const) would be permissible and whether any caller relies on modification of the pointed object.\n\n- metal_shmem_open: Caller of metal_shmem_try_map. The origin of the addr/phys values may lie here; inspect it to determine the original object\u2019s constness and whether a const-qualified pointer would propagate correctly through the call chain.\n\n- metal_map and metal_unmap: These are callees of metal_shmem_try_map and likely operate on the memory region described by addr. If either function modifies the memory pointed to by addr (or requires a non-const pointer), that affects whether addr in metal_virt2phys should be non-const. You need their signatures and bodies to determine if the memory region is ever modified.\n\n- _metal (global): The target function reads _metal.pagemap_fd and _metal.page_shift. Include the _metal definition to confirm these fields\u2019 types and to ensure the function\u2019s use of addr is strictly as an address (not used to modify pointee) and that no hidden side-effects or macros change pointer semantics.\n\n(These symbols let you trace how addr and phys are created, passed, and used across the call chain to decide whether they should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule.)"
