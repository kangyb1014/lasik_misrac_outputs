  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must inspect any symbols the target references (or that could contain the problematic call) so the analyzer can find any memcmp usage or string comparisons reachable from metal_virt2phys:\n\n- metal_log: target calls this logging function. Its implementation could (incorrectly) call memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings (e.g., for log filtering or format handling). You must inspect metal_log to be sure no memcmp-on-NT-strings occurs.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: macro/constant passed into metal_log; its definition may expand to string literals or expressions that influence how metal_log behaves; include it to see whether any string comparisons occur.\n- strerror: called in the error path; although typically a library function, its implementation should be checked in analysis context to ensure it does not use memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings (or to confirm it\u2019s safe to ignore).\n- pread: system / library call used to read the pagemap entry. Include to confirm it does not indirectly cause code paths that use memcmp on strings within this translation unit.\n- errno: the global error indicator is read/used; include its declaration to see usage patterns and ensure no string comparison there.\n- _metal (fields pagemap_fd, page_shift): the target reads these fields; include the _metal object/struct definition so the analyzer sees types and any possible accessors or wrappers (which might contain memcmp use).\n- memcmp (standard library): include the symbol so the analyzer can detect any direct uses in the target or in any of the listed callees/related symbols; this is the exact function forbidden for NT string comparisons.\n- metal_shmem_try_map: listed as a caller of metal_virt2phys in the static call graph. Include it so the analyzer can see the calling context and detect any passing of string pointers/indirections or additional calls to memcmp that could be relevant to the overall compliance of code that exercises metal_virt2phys.\n\nIncluding these symbols lets the next agent (a) detect any direct or indirect uses of memcmp that compare null\u2011terminated strings reachable from metal_virt2phys, and (b) determine whether such uses occur inside the target or only in unrelated library/system code that can be considered safe."
