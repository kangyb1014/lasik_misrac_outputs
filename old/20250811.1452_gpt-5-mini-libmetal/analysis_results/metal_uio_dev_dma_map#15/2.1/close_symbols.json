  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA unreachable-code analysis:\n\n- struct metal_sg\n  - Required to know the types and ranges of sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len (pointer type, signedness/width of len). These determine whether comparisons and arithmetic inside the loops can ever make the loop body or branches execute (e.g., whether vaddr_sg_hi <= vaddr_hi can be true). Also required to detect any constant/annotated invariants that would make code paths impossible.\n\n- struct linux_device (including .device.regions, .device.num_regions, .dev_name)\n  - The function iterates over ldev->device.regions and tests j against ldev->device.num_regions. The exact type and possible values (e.g., if num_regions is always 0 or a compile-time constant) determine whether the inner loop body or the return branch can ever be reached. dev_name is used in the logging call; its type/availability affects whether the logging call is well-formed.\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - Required to know io->virt and io->size types/semantics so pointer arithmetic and range comparisons vaddr_lo/vaddr_hi are well-defined. If io->size or virt have constraints (e.g., size == 0 always), that could make branches unreachable.\n\n- metal_log (declaration including attributes)\n  - If metal_log is declared with attributes (for example, noreturn) or its prototype has side effects that change control flow, that affects reachability analysis. The analyzer must know whether the call can return; if it cannot, code after the call would be unreachable.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING\n  - Needed so the analyzer can resolve the logging-call variant. Some logging macros expand to constructs that alter control flow (e.g., they could include abort() or longjmp). Knowing the macro definition is necessary to determine reachability after the call.\n\n- EINVAL\n  - The return value -EINVAL is used in the early return. While the numeric value itself does not affect reachability, knowing EINVAL ensures the return is a normal return and not an alias for something with side effects (rare, but macro definitions should be checked).\n\n- memcpy (declaration including attributes)\n  - The code calls memcpy(sg_out, sg_in, ...). If memcpy is replaced/annotated in this build (e.g., as a builtin or an intrinsified function with attributes that could affect control flow), the analyzer must know whether it can return normally. Also verifying the prototype ensures the call is well-formed and not a macro that expands to something altering control flow.\n\n- compiler/ABI rules for pointer arithmetic on void *\n  - The function performs vaddr_sg_lo + sg_in[i].len where vaddr_sg_lo is void*. Standard C does not permit arithmetic on void*; many compilers provide this as an extension (treating void* like char*). The exact semantics (unit size of addition) affect whether comparisons can ever succeed and therefore whether branches/loops are reachable.\n\nThese symbols/definitions are the minimal additional information needed to determine whether any path in metal_uio_dev_dma_map is impossible (unreachable) under the build\u2019s types, macros, attributes, and compiler/ABI semantics."
