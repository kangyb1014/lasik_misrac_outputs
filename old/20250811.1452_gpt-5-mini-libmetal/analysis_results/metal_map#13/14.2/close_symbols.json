The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions and linkage of any macros, types or functions that appear in metal_map because a MISRA check for \"well\u2011formed for loops\" needs assurance that no hidden or called code introduces or modifies a for loop (MISRA counts the behaviour of called functions and any macro expansions used in the function). For each symbol:\n\n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE: macros (usually constants). Verify they are simple integer constants and do not expand to code containing a for loop or side effects.\n- MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE, MAP_ANONYMOUS: mapping flags macros. Confirm these are constant definitions (no code/macro expansion that could contain a for loop or side effects). Also check they do not alias to inline/helper macros that introduce loops.\n- MAP_FAILED: macro/constant returned by mmap on failure. Ensure it is a simple sentinel (pointer constant) and not a macro that expands to code containing a for loop.\n- LOCK_EX, LOCK_UN: lock flag macros used with flock. Verify they are simple constants (no macro expansion that could include loops).\n- errno: macro or accessor (may be function-like on some platforms). Inspect its definition to ensure that using errno in expressions does not expand to code with loops or non\u2011local side effects that could affect loop well\u2011formedness analysis.\n- flock, fstat, ftruncate, mmap: these called functions must be inspected if any for loop in metal_map called these functions from within a for loop body. Although metal_map itself contains no for statements, to be thorough you must confirm these functions (or their inline/wrapper variants/macros) do not hide for loops or modify objects that would be used as loop counters if metal_map were changed. Also verify none are implemented as macros that expand into code containing for loops.\n- struct stat: the type definition must be available to verify that accessing stat.st_size has no surprising side effects (e.g., overloaded macros) and to ensure no hidden code is invoked when reading fields.\n- off_t, size_t: type definitions \u2014 ensure they are plain arithmetic types (no weird typedefs to struct with side effects) so they cannot hide loop counters or cause implicit calls when modified.\n\nIn short: inspect all macros/constants for macro expansions and all called functions (and their header wrappers/inline definitions) to ensure none introduce for statements or side effects that could violate the MISRA rule. These are the minimal symbols from metal_map that must be checked."
