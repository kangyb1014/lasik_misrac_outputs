  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for analyzing MISRA C string\u2011handling/bounds rule for metal_map:\n\n- mmap: The function that creates the mapping returned in *result. Understand its semantics (how it interprets size and offset, alignment, and failure modes) to decide whether subsequent memory accesses could go out of bounds and whether mmap itself might internally use any string functions (rare but must be ruled out).\n\n- MAP_FAILED: The sentinel compared to mmap result. Required to confirm the failure path and that the code correctly treats mmap failures (so no invalid pointer is later exposed to string functions).\n\n- PROT_READ / PROT_WRITE: Protection flags passed to mmap. Needed to know whether the mapping is writable/readable (affects whether subsequent string functions could legally write/read the mapping).\n\n- MAP_SHARED / MAP_PRIVATE / MAP_ANONYMOUS: Mapping flags that change mmap behavior (backing, visibility). They affect whether the mapping size/contents and lifetime are as the caller expects and whether any implicit zeroing or kernel behavior could mask out\u2011of\u2011bounds issues.\n\n- flock: Used to lock the file before fstat/ftruncate. Needed to understand error handling and ordering (if locking fails or is skipped, could the function return leaving state that enables out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses elsewhere).\n\n- fstat: Used to obtain stat.st_size. Required to verify how stat.st_size is obtained and used in the reqsize check (central to deciding if the file is extended sufficiently before mapping) and to ensure there is no signed/unsigned mistake leading to incorrect bounds checks.\n\n- ftruncate: Used to extend the file. Its semantics determine whether the file size after the call matches reqsize (so mapping of the requested region is valid), and whether failures are correctly handled.\n\n- errno: Used when converting system call failures to negative return codes. Needed to confirm correct error propagation and that an erroneous errno use does not mask a condition leading to later out\u2011of\u2011bounds uses.\n\n- struct stat (and stat.st_size): The structure and the st_size member type/semantics are essential to reason about the comparison stat.st_size < reqsize and potential overflow/sign issues: a mistaken interpretation of st_size could lead to incorrect bounds decisions.\n\n- off_t and size_t: Types of offset and size are central to the arithmetic reqsize = offset + size. You must know their signedness and width to detect possible integer overflow or sign\u2011conversion errors that would make the bounds check ineffective and could enable out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses when the mapping is used by string functions.\n\n- metal_uio_dev_open and metal_shmem_try_map (callers): Including the callers is important to obtain typical/possible argument values (offset, size, expand, fd) and calling context. They may pass values that lead to overflow or invalid offsets/sizes; analyzing only metal_map without knowing caller constraints can miss situations where string operations on the returned mapping would be out of bounds.\n\n(Collectively these symbols let the next analyst determine: 1) whether metal_map itself performs any string operations (it does not), 2) whether its computations/OS calls can produce mappings whose size/validity would permit subsequent string.h functions to access beyond object bounds, and 3) whether error paths could expose invalid pointers that callers might pass to string functions.)"
