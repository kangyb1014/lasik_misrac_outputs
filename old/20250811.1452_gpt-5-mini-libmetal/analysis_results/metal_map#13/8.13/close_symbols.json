  "explanation": "For deciding whether the returned void * (via the void **result parameter) should be const-qualified we must know whether any caller or callee subsequently writes through that pointer and what access the mapping grants. Each symbol is required as follows:\n\n- metal_uio_dev_open: caller of metal_map; must be inspected to see how it uses the returned pointer (reads only or writes/initialises memory).\n- metal_shmem_try_map: caller of metal_map; inspect for writes or casts that indicate mutable access to the mapped memory.\n- metal_uio_read_map_attr: callee used by metal_uio_dev_open; may access or modify mapping contents or metadata \u2014 must check for writes.\n- metal_uio_dev_bind: callee used by metal_uio_dev_open; may perform initialization or writes to the mapped region \u2014 inspect its use of the pointer.\n- metal_io_init: called by both callers; typically sets up I/O state and may write to the mapped memory (initialization), so its behaviour determines if the pointer must be mutable.\n- metal_linux_irq_register_dev: called from metal_uio_dev_open; could register handlers that write to or otherwise mutate the mapping \u2014 needs review.\n- metal_unmap: used by metal_shmem_try_map; while it unmaps memory (not a write), its usage and any intermediate actions can indicate lifetime and mutation patterns.\n- metal_virt2phys: called by metal_shmem_try_map; may take the mapped pointer to compute physical address or perform operations that read or write \u2014 check for writes or casts to mutable types.\n- mmap: the system/library call used to obtain the mapping; its prototype and semantics are needed to confirm how permissions are applied and whether the returned pointer is intended for writable access.\n- PROT_READ / PROT_WRITE: these flags determine whether the mapping allows writes. Presence of PROT_WRITE in metal_map suggests the mapping is writable (argues against const), so their definitions/usage must be considered.\n- MAP_SHARED / MAP_PRIVATE / MAP_ANONYMOUS: mapping type affects copy-on-write and visibility semantics; whether modifications are allowed and visible to others can influence whether callers treat the memory as mutable.\n- MAP_FAILED: used to detect mmap failure; not directly about constness but needed to fully understand metal_map error-path behaviour.\n\nIn short: to determine if the pointer could be const-qualified you must (a) inspect mmap/flag semantics (PROT_*, MAP_*) to know whether the mapping permits writes and (b) inspect all callers and related helper functions listed above to see whether any of them write through the returned pointer or cast it to mutable types. The listed symbols are the minimal set from the static call graph and mapping semantics required for that analysis."
