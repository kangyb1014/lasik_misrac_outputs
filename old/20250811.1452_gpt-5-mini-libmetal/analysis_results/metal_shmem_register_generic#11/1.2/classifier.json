  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_shmem_register_generic code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/88.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_shmem_register_generic as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_register_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_register_generic(struct metal_generic_shmem *shmem)\n{\n\t/* Make sure that we can be found. */\n\tmetal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0);\n\n\t/* Statically registered shmem regions cannot have a destructor. */\n\tmetal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close);\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list,\n\t\t\t    &shmem->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_shmem_register_generic:\n#define metal_assert(cond) metal_sys_assert(cond)\n...\nextern struct metal_state _metal\n...\nstruct metal_generic_shmem {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_io_region\tio;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above metal_shmem_register_generic code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function uses only standard C constructs (function call, pointer dereference, string length check, list manipulation). There are no compiler-specific extensions (no __attribute__, asm, typeof, statement-expression, nested functions, zero-length arrays, or other documented compiler extensions) visible in the provided code. Note: if the macro metal_assert or any of the list/io helpers were implemented using a compiler extension, that would be a violation, but no such implementation details were provided here.",
