  "explanation": "For determining whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions of every macro, function and type the function references, because extensions commonly appear in those definitions (not just in this small body). Reason each symbol is needed:\n\n- metal_assert: It's a macro (or function-like macro). Macros often hide compiler extensions (statement-expression GCC extension, __attribute__, typeof, builtins, __extension__, inline asm, variadic macro extensions). Inspecting its definition is required to see if it uses any nonstandard compiler extensions.\n\n- strlen: Although a standard C library function, some platforms implement library functions as macros or use compiler builtins/attributes. Check its declaration/definition or included headers to ensure no extension (e.g., builtin overloads, attribute((...))) is used.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail: This is called from the function and may be a macro or inline that uses nonstandard constructs (statement expressions, typeof, container_of macros that use GCC extensions). Its prototype/definition must be checked.\n\n- _metal: The global object whose member generic_shmem_list is referenced. Its type/definition may contain compiler-specific attributes, anonymous structs/unions, or other extensions that affect whether the code uses language extensions.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: The parameter type. You must inspect the struct definition to see whether it contains any extension (anonymous/unnamed members, attributes, bit-field packing pragmas, zero-length arrays, flexible-array usage declared with extensions, etc.).\n\n- member: shmem->name: The code dereferences shmem->name and passes it to strlen; the member's type (char *, array, or macro) must be known to ensure no extension (e.g., nonstandard pointer qualifiers or macros) is involved.\n\n- member group: shmem->io and its nested ops/close: Nested member access could rely on anonymous structs/unions or other extensions. Also ops.close is a function pointer; its declaration could use attributes or nonstandard calling conventions\u2014these definitions must be inspected.\n\n- member: shmem->node: This is passed to the list insertion routine. The node's type or any macros used to link it into the list (e.g., container_of) may use extensions.\n\n- _metal.common.generic_shmem_list: The list head object type must be inspected for anonymous structs, attributes, or other extensions in its declaration.\n\n- definitions of the list types used by metal_list_add_tail (e.g., metal_list / node types): List helper macros/functions frequently use GCC extensions (statement expressions, typeof, __builtin, attributes). Inspecting these types/definitions is necessary.\n\n- declarations/definitions (headers) that introduce the above macros/functions/types: Finally, the header files that bring these symbols into scope must be examined because extension usage is often introduced at include-time (macros, attribute macros, compiler-specific wrappers).\n\nOnly by examining these symbols/definitions can you determine whether any of them (and thus the target function by dependency) use language extensions that MISRA forbids. The list is intentionally concise and focused on the symbols actually referenced by the target function and the definitions that commonly hide extensions."
