  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d for metal_shmem_register_generic you must be able to prove that the parameter variable shmem itself is not assigned to or otherwise modified. The following symbols are needed and why:\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (full definition): to confirm shmem is a pointer and to see the exact member names/types (name, io, node). Also to ensure none of the members are macros or unusual types that could alias or hide assignment to the parameter variable.\n\n- metal_assert (macro or function definition): metal_assert is invoked with expressions that include shmem. If metal_assert is a macro it could expand to code that assigns to or otherwise modifies its argument; the expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not modify the shmem parameter variable.\n\n- strlen (declaration/prototype): to confirm it takes a const char * and does not modify the pointer parameter; this helps show that calling strlen(shmem->name) does not modify the shmem parameter itself.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (declaration/definition): the call passes &shmem->node. You must check the prototype/definition to ensure it does not take a pointer to the shmem pointer (e.g. pointer-to-pointer) or otherwise perform operations that could modify the shmem parameter variable (it normally operates on the node, which is allowed, but this must be verified).\n\n- _metal (global object) and type of _metal.common.generic_shmem_list: to verify the types passed to metal_list_add_tail and to ensure no hidden macros/overloads alter shmem.\n\n- type of shmem->node (e.g. struct metal_list_node): to confirm that taking &shmem->node yields an address to a subobject (allowed) and to inspect whether node-related operations could somehow require modifying the shmem pointer itself (rare but must be ruled out).\n\n- types for shmem->io and shmem->io.ops (e.g. struct metal_io / struct metal_io_ops): to confirm that the expression shmem->io.ops.close is a simple member access (used in an assert) and that evaluating it cannot cause side effects that modify the shmem parameter variable.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether any macro expansions or called functions/prototypes could modify the parameter variable shmem (which would violate the MISRA rule) or whether only the pointees/subobjects are modified (which is permitted)."
