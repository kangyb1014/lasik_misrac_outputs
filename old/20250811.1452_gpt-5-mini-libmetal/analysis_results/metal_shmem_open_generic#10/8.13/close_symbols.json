  "explanation": "- struct metal_generic_shmem: The target returns &shmem->io. You must see the definition of this struct to know the type and qualifiers of the io member (e.g., whether it is declared const) so you can tell if returning a non-const pointer violates the rule.\n- struct metal_io_region: Determine whether the region type itself or its members are const-qualified; also needed to know if the API is intended to present mutable or immutable region objects.\n- metal_io_region_size (prototype/definition): The target calls this function. Its parameter constness (e.g., takes const struct metal_io_region * vs struct metal_io_region *) provides evidence whether region objects are intended to be treated as read-only in callers.\n- metal_shmem_open (definition): This function is the caller of metal_shmem_open_generic. Inspecting its use of the returned struct metal_io_region * (e.g., whether it passes the pointer to functions that modify the region) is necessary to justify a non-const result parameter.\n- metal_open (prototype/definition): Called by metal_shmem_open; check whether it accepts/needs a mutable struct metal_io_region * (i.e., whether it modifies the region). If it mutates the region, returning a non-const pointer is justified.\n- metal_shmem_try_map (prototype/definition): Also called by metal_shmem_open; inspect its parameter constness and semantics to see whether callers require a mutable region pointer.\n- metal_container_of (macro/definition): Used to derive the containing metal_generic_shmem from the list node; include to confirm the types involved and that shmem->io is the same object whose address is returned.\n\nIncluding these symbols lets the analyzer determine (1) whether the target itself mutates the pointed object, (2) whether the returned pointer refers to a const-qualified object, and (3) whether callers expect or perform modifications on the returned region \u2014 all required to assess compliance with the MISRA const-pointer rule."
