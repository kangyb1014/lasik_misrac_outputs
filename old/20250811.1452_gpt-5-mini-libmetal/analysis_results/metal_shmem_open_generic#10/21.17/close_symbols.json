  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each requested symbol (focused on the MISRA C string-bounds rule):\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (definition, including the 'name' and 'io' members)\n  - Need to know the type and storage of shmem->name (e.g., char name[N] versus char *), its declared size, and whether the code guarantees a terminating '\\0'. strcmp reads bytes until a NUL; if name is a fixed-size buffer the declared size matters for bounds checks.\n\n- Functions that allocate/initialize/modify struct metal_generic_shmem instances (where shmem->name is assigned)\n  - To determine how shmem->name is populated (copied from user input, strncpy usage, heap allocation, pointer assignment) and whether the producer ensures NUL-termination and sufficient storage. Also to detect possible dangling pointers or later modifications that could break termination.\n\n- global _metal and _metal.common.generic_shmem_list (definition/initialization)\n  - To confirm what objects are stored in the list (ensures they are truly struct metal_generic_shmem instances) and to find where list entries are added so the initialization path for shmem->name can be inspected.\n\n- struct metal_list and the metal_list_for_each macro definition\n  - To ensure the iteration yields valid node pointers and to verify the loop visits only valid list entries (so shmem pointer computed from node points to valid memory with a proper name buffer).\n\n- metal_container_of macro definition\n  - To validate that metal_container_of correctly computes the containing struct pointer from the node pointer (ensuring shmem points to the expected memory layout and member offsets).\n\n- strcmp prototype / <string.h> semantics (documentation of behavior)\n  - Although standard, we explicitly need the semantics: strcmp reads both strings until NUL and therefore both operands must be non-NULL and NUL-terminated within their allocated bounds. This links directly to the MISRA rule about accesses beyond object bounds.\n\n- metal_shmem_open (the caller) and its callers (to trace origin and validation of the 'name' parameter)\n  - The other strcmp operand is the function parameter 'name'. To determine whether passing 'name' to strcmp can cause out-of-bounds reads, inspect callers (metal_shmem_open and upstream) to see how 'name' is obtained, whether it can be NULL, and whether its termination/length is validated prior to this call.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether both operands passed to strcmp in metal_shmem_open_generic are guaranteed to be valid, NUL-terminated character arrays within their bounds (thus satisfying the MISRA requirement)."
