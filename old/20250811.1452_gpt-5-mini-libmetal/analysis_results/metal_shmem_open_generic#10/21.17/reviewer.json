  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The call to strcmp(shmem->name, name) can read memory until a NUL byte is found; if either argument does not have a terminating '\\0' within the bounds of the underlying object (for example a fixed-size char array that has been completely filled), strcmp will access beyond the object bounds and invoke undefined behaviour. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically forbids such use of <string.h> functions that may read beyond object bounds. The posted function performs no checks that either pointer is non-NULL or that the buffers contain a terminating NUL within their storage, so unless there is an external invariant (not shown) guaranteeing NUL termination, this is a violation. (Additional issues: strcmp also requires non-NULL pointers, so a NULL name would similarly be problematic.) Recommended fixes include ensuring stored names are NUL-terminated when populated, storing and using explicit lengths with bounded comparisons (e.g. strncmp with the buffer size or memcmp with known lengths), or otherwise proving the termination invariant."
