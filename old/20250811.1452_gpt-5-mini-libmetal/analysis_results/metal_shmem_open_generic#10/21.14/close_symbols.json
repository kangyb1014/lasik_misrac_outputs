  "explanation": "- strcmp: The target function calls strcmp(shmem->name, name). To decide whether the code violates the MISRA rule we must inspect how strcmp is provided in this codebase (real implementation or macro). If strcmp is implemented or aliased to a memcmp-based routine (or macro-mapped to memcmp), that would constitute use of memcmp on null-terminated strings and be a violation.\n- memcmp: Even if the target source does not call memcmp directly, the rule concerns use of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings. Inspecting memcmp (and where it is referenced) lets the analyzer detect whether any used string-comparison functions (strcmp or macros) delegate to memcmp.\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: The target dereferences shmem->name. The analyzer must see the struct definition to confirm the type and semantic of the name member (e.g., char * or fixed-size char array) and to determine whether it represents a null-terminated string. If name is not a null-terminated string the MISRA rule in question would not apply in the same way.\n- metal_container_of: The code obtains the containing struct via metal_container_of(node, struct metal_generic_shmem, node). To locate the shmem->name member and confirm its type/semantics the analyzer may need the macro's expansion or definition so it can resolve the pointer arithmetic and confirm that the node-to-struct conversion is correct.\n- metal_list_for_each: The loop uses this macro to iterate the list. To be certain the loop yields valid shmem objects and that shmem->name is accessed as expected, the analyzer should see the macro definition (iteration semantics). This helps ensure the comparison is indeed between null-terminated strings and not some other buffer semantics.\n\nProvide these symbols/definitions (strcmp and memcmp implementations or macro mappings, the full definition of struct metal_generic_shmem, and the macros metal_container_of and metal_list_for_each) to the next analyzer so it can conclusively determine whether a memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings."
