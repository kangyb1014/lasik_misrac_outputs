The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_shmem_open_generic as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_open_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_open_generic(const char *name, size_t size,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_io_region **result)\n{\n\tstruct metal_generic_shmem *shmem;\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list, node) {\n\t\tshmem = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_generic_shmem, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(shmem->name, name) != 0)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\tif (size <= metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io)) {\n\t\t\t*result = &shmem->io;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENOENT;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_shmem_open_generic code violates the rule 2.1 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: All code paths are reachable. The loop body executes for each list node, the 'continue' statement skips to the next iteration but does not create unreachable code, the 'return 0' is reachable when a matching shmem with sufficient size is found, and the final 'return -ENOENT' is reachable when no matching element is found (or the list is empty). Thus there is no unreachable code in metal_shmem_open_generic.",
