  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_shmem_open_generic code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/82.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_shmem_open_generic as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_open_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_open_generic(const char *name, size_t size,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_io_region **result)\n{\n\tstruct metal_generic_shmem *shmem;\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list, node) {\n\t\tshmem = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_generic_shmem, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(shmem->name, name) != 0)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\tif (size <= metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io)) {\n\t\t\t*result = &shmem->io;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENOENT;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_shmem_open_generic:\nstruct metal_generic_shmem {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_io_region\tio;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_io_region {\n\tvoid\t\t\t*virt;      /**< base virtual address */\n\tconst metal_phys_addr_t\t*physmap;   /**< table of base physical address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of each of the pages in the I/O\n\t\t\t\t\t\t region */\n\tsize_t\t\t\tsize;       /**< size of the I/O region */\n\tunsigned long\t\tpage_shift; /**< page shift of I/O region */\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\tpage_mask;  /**< page mask of I/O region */\n\tunsigned int\t\tmem_flags;  /**< memory attribute of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I/O region */\n\tstruct metal_io_ops\tops;        /**< I/O region operations */\n}\n...\nstruct metal_list {\n\tstruct metal_list *next, *prev;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above metal_shmem_open_generic code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Every operation in metal_shmem_open_generic affects program behaviour: the list traversal selects a matching shmem by name, the size comparison determines whether the found region is acceptable, the assignment to *result and the return 0 are used by callers, and the final return -ENOENT is reached when no suitable region is found. There is no executed statement whose removal would not change program behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated.",
