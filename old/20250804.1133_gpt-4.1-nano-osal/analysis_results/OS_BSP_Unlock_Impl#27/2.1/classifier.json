The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Restore previous cancellability state */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState, NULL);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl code violates the rule 2.1 or not.",
