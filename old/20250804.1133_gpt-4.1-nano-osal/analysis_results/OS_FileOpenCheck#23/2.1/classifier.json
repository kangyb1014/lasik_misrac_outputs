The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_FileOpenCheck as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileOpenCheck:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileOpenCheck(const char *Filename)\n{\n    int32                        return_code;\n    OS_object_iter_t             iter;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(Filename);\n\n    return_code = OS_ERROR;\n\n    OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, &iter);\n\n    while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n    {\n        stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, iter.token);\n        if (stream->socket_domain == OS_SocketDomain_INVALID && (strcmp(stream->stream_name, Filename) == 0))\n        {\n            return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_FileOpenCheck:\n#define OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,OS_INVALID_POINTER)\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(osal_objtype_t objtype, OS_object_iter_t *iter)\n{\n    return OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit(OS_ObjectFilterActive, NULL, objtype, iter);\n}\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_FileOpenCheck code violates the rule 2.1 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function contains a loop with a break statement, which might terminate the loop prematurely, but it does not necessarily imply unreachable code. However, if there were a situation where code after certain condition checks or within certain branches is never executed, that would violate the rule. In the provided code, no unreachable code is apparent.",
