  "explanation": "The use of 'dlopen' in the code constitutes the use of a POSIX extension, as it is not part of the standard C language, and it is explicitly documented as such. Therefore, employing 'dlopen' indeed violates MISRA C 2023 rule 1.2, which states that language extensions should not be used. The modified code example provided by the agent does not include 'dlopen' and thus does not violate the rule."
