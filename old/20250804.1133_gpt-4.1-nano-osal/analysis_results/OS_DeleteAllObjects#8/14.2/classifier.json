  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_DeleteAllObjects code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/68.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_DeleteAllObjects as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_DeleteAllObjects:\n```c\nvoid OS_DeleteAllObjects(void)\n{\n    uint32 ObjectCount;\n    uint32 TryCount;\n\n    /*\n     * Note - this is done in a loop because some objects depend on other objects\n     * and you will not be able to delete the object until the ref count becomes zero.\n     */\n    TryCount = 0;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        ObjectCount = 0;\n        ++TryCount;\n\n        /* Delete timers and tasks first, as they could be actively using other object types  */\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        /* Then try to delete all other remaining objects of any type */\n        OS_ForEachObject(OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        if (ObjectCount == 0 || TryCount > 4)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n        OS_TaskDelay(5);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_DeleteAllObjects:\nuint32 ObjectCount\n...\nuint32 TryCount\n...\nvoid OS_ForEachObjectOfType(osal_objtype_t idtype, osal_id_t creator_id, OS_ArgCallback_t callback_ptr,\n                            void *callback_arg)\n{\n    OS_object_iter_t    iter;\n    OS_creator_filter_t filter;\n\n    filter.creator_id    = creator_id;\n    filter.user_callback = callback_ptr;\n    filter.user_arg      = callback_arg;\n\n    if (OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit(OS_ForEachFilterCreator, &filter, idtype, &iter) == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry(&iter, OS_ForEachDoCallback);\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n}\n...\nvoid OS_CleanUpObject(osal_id_t object_id, void *arg)\n{\n    uint32 *ObjectCount;\n\n    ObjectCount = (uint32 *)arg;\n    ++(*ObjectCount);\n    switch (OS_IdentifyObject(object_id))\n    {\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK:\n            OS_TaskDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_QUEUE:\n            OS_QueueDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_BINSEM:\n            OS_BinSemDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_COUNTSEM:\n            OS_CountSemDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MUTEX:\n            OS_MutSemDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE:\n            OS_ModuleUnload(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE:\n            OS_TimeBaseDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB:\n            OS_TimerDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_STREAM:\n            OS_close(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_DIR:\n            OS_DirectoryClose(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR:\n            OS_CondVarDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n}\n...\nint32 OS_TaskDelay(uint32 millisecond)\n{\n    /* just call the implementation */\n    return OS_TaskDelay_Impl(millisecond);\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_DeleteAllObjects code violates the rule 14.2 or not.",
