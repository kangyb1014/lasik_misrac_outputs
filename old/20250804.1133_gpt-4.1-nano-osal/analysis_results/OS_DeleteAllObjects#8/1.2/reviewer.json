  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The scenario describes the use of the 'true' keyword in the code, which is a language extension in some C compilers. Since MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 states that language extensions should not be used, the presence of 'true' as a keyword (assuming it's not part of standard C, which relies on <stdbool.h> for boolean types) constitutes a violation of this rule. The argument about the test code and logging does not impact the violation of the language extension rule. Therefore, the agent's claim that the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is correct."
