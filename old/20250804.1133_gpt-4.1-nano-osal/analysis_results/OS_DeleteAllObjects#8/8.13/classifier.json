  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_DeleteAllObjects code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/67.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_DeleteAllObjects as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_DeleteAllObjects:\n```c\nvoid OS_DeleteAllObjects(void)\n{\n    uint32 ObjectCount;\n    uint32 TryCount;\n\n    /*\n     * Note - this is done in a loop because some objects depend on other objects\n     * and you will not be able to delete the object until the ref count becomes zero.\n     */\n    TryCount = 0;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        ObjectCount = 0;\n        ++TryCount;\n\n        /* Delete timers and tasks first, as they could be actively using other object types  */\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        /* Then try to delete all other remaining objects of any type */\n        OS_ForEachObject(OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        if (ObjectCount == 0 || TryCount > 4)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n        OS_TaskDelay(5);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_DeleteAllObjects:\nvoid OS_ForEachObjectOfType(osal_objtype_t idtype, osal_id_t creator_id, OS_ArgCallback_t callback_ptr,\n                            void *callback_arg)\n{\n    OS_object_iter_t    iter;\n    OS_creator_filter_t filter;\n\n    filter.creator_id    = creator_id;\n    filter.user_callback = callback_ptr;\n    filter.user_arg      = callback_arg;\n\n    if (OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit(OS_ForEachFilterCreator, &filter, idtype, &iter) == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry(&iter, OS_ForEachDoCallback);\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ForEachObject(osal_id_t creator_id, OS_ArgCallback_t callback_ptr, void *callback_arg)\n{\n    osal_objtype_t idtype;\n\n    for (idtype = 0; idtype < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER; ++idtype)\n    {\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(idtype, creator_id, callback_ptr, callback_arg);\n    }\n}\n...\nint32 OS_TaskDelay(uint32 millisecond)\n{\n    /* just call the implementation */\n    return OS_TaskDelay_Impl(millisecond);\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_DeleteAllObjects code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
