  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_CountSemTake_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/154.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_CountSemTake_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CountSemTake_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CountSemTake_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token);\n\n    if (sem_wait(&impl->id) < 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_CountSemTake_Impl:\nint32 OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, osal_id_t id, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit(lock_mode, idtype, token);\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return return_code;\n    }\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex(idtype, id, &token->obj_idx);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        token->obj_id = id;\n\n        /*\n         * The \"ConvertToken\" routine will return with the global lock\n         * in a state appropriate for returning to the caller, as indicated\n         * by the \"check_mode\" parameter.\n         *\n         * Note If this operation fails, then it always unlocks the global for\n         * all check_mode's other than NONE.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdConvertToken(token);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_CountSemTake_Impl code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",

  "scenario": "The function OS_CountSemTake_Impl calls sem_wait and subsequently returns OS_SEM_FAILURE if sem_wait returns a negative value, otherwise it returns OS_SUCCESS. There is no unreachable code or dead code in this function, as all code paths could potentially be executed depending on the outcome of sem_wait call. Therefore, there is no violation of Rule 2.2.",
