The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "The symbol 'OS_TaskEntryPoint' is a callee of the target function and is directly invoked within it. Analyzing this symbol helps determine if any typical CPU or loop control-related code occurs within or impacts it, which is relevant for the violation of the for loop rule. Since the target function itself does not contain a for loop, understanding the behavior of 'OS_TaskEntryPoint' provides context about any indirect influence or side effects that could relate to loop control rules."
