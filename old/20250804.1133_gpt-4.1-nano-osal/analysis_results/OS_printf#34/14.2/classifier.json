  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_printf code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/276.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_printf as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_printf:\n```c\nvoid OS_printf(const char *String, ...)\n{\n    va_list va;\n    char    msg_buffer[OS_BUFFER_SIZE];\n    int     actualsz;\n\n    BUGCHECK_VOID(String != NULL)\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER)\n    {\n        /*\n         * Catch some historical mis-use of the OS_printf() call.\n         *\n         * Typically OS_printf() should NOT be called before OS_API_Init().\n         *\n         * This was never guaranteed to work, particularly on a VxWorks\n         * deployment where the utility task was enabled.\n         *\n         * However, some PSPs do this, particularly those that used POSIX\n         * where it happened to work (because OS_printf just called printf).\n         *\n         * As a workaround, use the OS_DEBUG facility to dump the message,\n         * along with a clue that this API is being used inappropriately.\n         *\n         * If debugging is not enabled, then this message will be silently\n         * discarded.\n         */\n        OS_DEBUG(\"BUG: OS_printf() called when OSAL not initialized: %s\", String);\n    }\n    else if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled)\n    {\n        /* Format and determine the size of string to write */\n        va_start(va, String);\n        actualsz = vsnprintf(msg_buffer, sizeof(msg_buffer), String, va);\n        va_end(va);\n\n        if (actualsz < 0)\n        {\n            /* unlikely: vsnprintf failed */\n            actualsz = 0;\n        }\n        else if (actualsz >= OS_BUFFER_SIZE)\n        {\n            /* truncate */\n            actualsz = OS_BUFFER_SIZE - 1;\n        }\n\n        msg_buffer[actualsz] = 0;\n\n        OS_ConsoleWrite(OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfConsoleId, msg_buffer);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_printf:\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nextern OS_SharedGlobalVars_t OS_SharedGlobalVars\n...\n#define OS_BUFFER_SIZE 172\n...\nint32 OS_ConsoleWrite(osal_id_t console_id, const char *Str)\n{\n    int32                         return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t             token;\n    OS_console_internal_record_t *console;\n    size_t                        PendingWritePos;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONSOLE, console_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        console = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_console_table, token);\n\n        /*\n         * The entire string should be put to the ring buffer,\n         * or none of it.
