  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_rename code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/168.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_rename as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_rename:\n```c\nint32 OS_rename(const char *old, const char *new)\n{\n    OS_object_iter_t             iter;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    int32                        return_code;\n    char                         old_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    char                         new_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(old, old_path);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_TranslatePath(new, new_path);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_FileRename_Impl(old_path, new_path);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, &iter);\n\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, iter.token);\n\n            if (stream->socket_domain == OS_SocketDomain_INVALID && strcmp(stream->stream_name, old) == 0)\n            {\n                strncpy(stream->stream_name, new, sizeof(stream->stream_name) - 1);\n                stream->stream_name[sizeof(stream->stream_name) - 1] = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_rename:\nvoid OS_printf(const char *String, ...)\n{\n    va_list va;\n    char    msg_buffer[OS_BUFFER_SIZE];\n    int     actualsz;\n\n    BUGCHECK_VOID(String != NULL)\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER)\n    {\n        /*\n         * Catch some historical mis-use of the OS_printf() call.\n         *\n         * Typically OS_printf() should NOT be called before OS_API_Init().\n         *\n         * This was never guaranteed to work, particularly on a VxWorks\n         * deployment where the utility task was enabled.\n         *\n         * However, some PSPs do this, particularly those that used POSIX\n         * where it happened to work (because OS_printf just called printf).\n         *\n         * As a workaround, use the OS_DEBUG facility to dump the message,\n         * along with a clue that this API is being used inappropriately.\n         *\n         * If debugging is not enabled, then this message will be silently\n         * discarded.\n         */\n        OS_DEBUG(\"BUG: OS_printf() called when OSAL not initialized: %s\", String);\n    }\n    else if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled)\n    {\n        /* Format and determine the size of string to write */\n        va_start(va, String);\n        actualsz = vsnprintf(msg_buffer, sizeof(msg_buffer), String, va);\n        va_end(va);\n\n        if (actualsz < 0)\n        {\n            /* unlikely: vsnprintf failed */\n            actualsz = 0;\n        }\n        else if (actualsz >= OS_BUFFER_SIZE)\n        {\n            /* truncate */\n            actualsz = OS_BUFFER_SIZE - 1;\n        }\n\n        msg_buffer[actualsz] = 0;\n\n        OS_ConsoleWrite(OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfConsoleId, msg_buffer);\n    }\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_rename code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
