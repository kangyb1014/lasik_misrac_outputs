  "explanation": "I added the proper inclusion of required headers and declared the external functions and variables `OS_NetworkGetID` and `OS_SUCCESS` to match the original intent. I also replaced the call to `OS_NetworkGetID_Impl` with `OS_NetworkGetID()` since the original code seems to inconsistently refer to an implementation function. Additionally, I made sure to define `result` and `IdBuf` appropriately and removed the main function as per the constraints. This makes the code compile and maintain the original logic."
