  "explanation": "I moved the definition of 'OS_SymbolLookup_Static' outside of the nested function 'log_info', and I ensured all code is properly scoped and not nested within another function. This syntax makes the code compilable. Additionally, I fixed the line '++StaticSym;' to 'StaticSym++;' for clarity, though both are valid in C. The original logic is preserved, with 'OS_SymbolLookup_Static' functioning as intended and including the logging."
