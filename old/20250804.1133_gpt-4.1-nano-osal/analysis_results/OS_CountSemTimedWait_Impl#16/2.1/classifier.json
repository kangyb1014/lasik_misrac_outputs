The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl contains a code path where sem_timedwait is called, and depending on its return value, the function returns a specific result. Unreachable code would be any code path that can never be executed, such as code after a return statement that is always taken, or code guarded by a condition that can never be true. In this implementation, all control paths are reachable; sem_timedwait is called, and the function proceeds based on its return value. Therefore, there is no unreachable code.",
