  "close_symbols": [],
  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required for analyzing the target function against the specified MISRA C rule because the rule pertains primarily to the usage and declaration of pointer types within the code and their const qualification, not necessarily involving external symbols or functions. The function mainly interacts with standard library functions and pthread functions, which are well-defined in terms of const correctness, and the analysis can be performed based on the code within the function itself."
