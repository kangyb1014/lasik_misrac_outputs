  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 is: A project shall not contain unreachable code.\n\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/161.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(const char *Str, size_t DataLen)\n{\n    ssize_t WriteLen;\n\n    while (DataLen > 0)\n    {\n        /* writes the raw data directly to STDOUT_FILENO (unbuffered) */\n        WriteLen = write(STDOUT_FILENO, Str, DataLen);\n        if (WriteLen <= 0)\n        {\n            /* no recourse if this fails, just stop. */\n            break;\n        }\n        Str += WriteLen;\n        DataLen -= WriteLen;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl code violates the rule 2.1 or not.",
