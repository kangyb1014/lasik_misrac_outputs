  "explanation": "The provided code for OS_ConsoleWrite does not include any usage of memcmp or similar string comparison functions. The scenario described by agent A involves the use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, which is a separate example and is not present in the given code. Therefore, the claim that OS_ConsoleWrite violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 based on the provided code is incorrect, as there is no usage of memcmp or any other standard library string comparison function in the original code."
