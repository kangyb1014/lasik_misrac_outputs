  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_CondVarLock_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/203.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_CondVarLock_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CondVarLock_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CondVarLock_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int                                status;\n    OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut);\n    if (status != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_CondVarLock_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t OS_impl_condvar_table[OS_MAX_CONDVARS]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_mutex_t mut;\n    pthread_cond_t  cv;\n} OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_CondVarLock_Impl code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "In the function OS_CondVarLock_Impl, the pointer 'impl' points to an element of OS_impl_condvar_table which is of type OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t. The code obtains a non-const pointer to this object, and then calls pthread_mutex_lock on its 'mut' member, which is a non-const pointer. This usage aligns with the MISRA rule 8.13, since the pointer points to a non-const type, and we are modifying the object via this pointer.",
