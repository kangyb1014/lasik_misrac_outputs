  "explanation": "The report claims that passing a pointer to a const object and then modifying or potentially modifying the object pointed to could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. However, in the provided code, the function accepts a 'const OS_object_token_t *token', which indicates that the function should not modify the object pointed to by 'token'. The code within the function does not modify '*token', nor does it modify 'token' itself; it merely reads from it to access 'impl'. The added logging code also does not modify 'token'. Therefore, the function does not violate Rule 17.8, since it respects the 'const' qualifier and does not modify the input object or the pointer. The violation scenario presented by the agent is based on the assumption that 'token' or what it points to are modified, but there is no evidence in the code that such a modification occurs. Consequently, the report is incorrect."
