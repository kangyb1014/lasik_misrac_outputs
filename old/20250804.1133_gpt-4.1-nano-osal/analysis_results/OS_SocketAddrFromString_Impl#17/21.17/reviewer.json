  "explanation": "The report claims that calling inet_pton could result in buffer overflows by writing beyond the bounds of the buffers pointed to by addrbuffer (sin_addr or sin6_addr). According to the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17, this is a concern if the function's implementation does not correctly handle buffer sizes, which could lead to unsafe memory access. However, inet_pton is a standard function designed to convert address strings to network address structures, and it internally manages buffer sizes for the specific address family. The buffers pointed to by sin_addr and sin6_addr are fixed-size and well-known, and inet_pton's parameters match these expected buffer sizes. Therefore, under typical usage, inet_pton does not access beyond these fixed buffer sizes, and there is no evidence suggesting that passing a malformed string could cause overflows beyond these buffers. The claim that the function could write beyond the bounds of these buffers due to incorrect handling of large or malformed strings does not hold, given the function's contract and implementation. Consequently, the usage in the code does not violate MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17."
