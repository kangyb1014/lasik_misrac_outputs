  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/141.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl(OS_SockAddr_t *Addr, const char *string)\n{\n    void *                  addrbuffer;\n    OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor;\n\n    Accessor = (OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData;\n\n    switch (Accessor->sa.sa_family)\n    {\n        case AF_INET:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr;\n            break;\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n        case AF_INET6:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr;\n            break;\n#endif\n        default:\n            return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    /* This function is defined as returning 1 on success, not 0 */\n    if (inet_pton(Accessor->sa.sa_family, string, addrbuffer) != 1)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl code violates the rule 17.8 or not.",

  "scenario": "The function parameter 'Addr' is a pointer, and it is a non-const pointer, but the pointer itself is modified within the function if any operation such as assigning to 'Accessor' or dereferencing occurs. However, in this function, 'Addr' is only dereferenced to access data, and not modified to point elsewhere. Therefore, the pointer itself is not modified.",
