  "explanation": "The original code modified the loop variable 'i' inside the loop, which is generally problematic and can cause compile errors or undefined behavior. I removed the assignment 'i = 100;' inside the loop. This preserves the original intent of the loop for simulation purposes but adheres to good coding practices, allowing the code to compile successfully."
