  "explanation": "The scenario described involves the function OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl potentially using memcmp to compare strings, which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 if memcmp is indeed used for string comparison. However, the provided implementation of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl does not show any usage of memcmp or any string comparison function; it only logs the input parameters. Therefore, based on the provided code, there is no evidence that memcmp is used for null-terminated string comparison, and the claim of violation cannot be substantiated with this code snippet."
