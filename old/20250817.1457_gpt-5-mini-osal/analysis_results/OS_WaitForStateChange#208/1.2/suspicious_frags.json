  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were detected in the provided function. Specifically:\n- There are no use of compiler-specific keywords or builtins (e.g. __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, _Pragma with vendor-specific pragmas).\n- There are no nested functions or statement-expressions ({ ... } used as an expression) which are GCC extensions.\n- There are no inline assembly statements or vendor-specific inline pragmas.\n- The identifier usage (uint32, osal_key_t, OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID, OS_objtype_state) appear as ordinary typedefs/macros and not compiler extensions; typedefs/macros are standard C features (the snippet does not show any nonstandard type qualifiers or extension syntax).\n- The comment \"/* cppcheck-suppress redundantAssignment */\" is a static-analysis tool directive in a comment and not a compiler language extension.\n\nTherefore, under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibiting language extensions), there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for use of compiler language extensions."
