  "explanation": "- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: The key control-flow question is whether this callee ever returns (e.g. marked noreturn, calls exit/longjmp, blocks forever). If it does not return then the final restore assignment is unreachable. Need its prototype/definition and any attributes.  \n- OS_objtype_state and OS_objtype_state_t: The function indexes &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type] and reads/writes objtype->owner_key. You must know the array symbol, its size and the structure layout (owner_key field, volatile qualifiers, side-effecting members) to determine whether the subsequent store is reachable/meaningful or if UB (which can affect reachability) can occur.  \n- OS_object_token_t: To determine valid ranges/semantics of token->obj_type (index into the objtype array). If obj_type is constrained such that the function can never reach certain lines (or causes UB/crash before the later assignment), that affects reachability analysis.  \n- osal_key_t: The type of owner_key (saved_unlock_key) \u2014 if the type has special semantics (e.g. volatile, a function pointer, or assignment macro) this can affect whether the assignment can be optimized away or considered unreachable.  \n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: The constant assigned to owner_key; if this is a macro that expands to a non-returning expression or has other side effects, it can affect whether code after the assignment is reachable.  \n- OS_ObjectIdConvertToken and its callers (OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew): To determine whether OS_WaitForStateChange is reachable from program entry you must inspect its callers and caller chain. If none of these callers are reachable from any program entry points then the whole function (and its statements) may be unreachable.  \n- main: Include a program entry point (or other system init entry) so reachability can be determined from the program start.  \nProviding the definitions/prototypes/attributes for these symbols (and the call graph up to program entry) is necessary to decide if any statement in OS_WaitForStateChange is provably never executed, which is the MISRA \"no unreachable code\" concern."
