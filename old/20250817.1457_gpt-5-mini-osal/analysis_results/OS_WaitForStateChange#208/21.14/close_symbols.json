  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_WaitForStateChange violates the MISRA rule prohibiting use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any code it invokes and any symbols that affect what is being compared: \n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: the direct callee \u2014 the implementation may perform comparisons (including calls to memcmp). The body of this function must be checked for any memcmp usage and how its arguments are formed. \n\n- memcmp: the standard-library symbol itself \u2014 needed to identify direct uses and to inspect argument types/lengths where it is called to determine whether the operands are null-terminated strings (which would violate the rule). \n\n- OS_object_token_t: definition of the token type passed into OS_WaitForStateChange. Fields in this struct might be forwarded into called functions; knowing their types (char*, arrays, integer IDs, etc.) is necessary to determine whether memcmp is comparing strings. \n\n- OS_objtype_state: definition of the objtype structure manipulated by the function (and potentially passed into the impl). Its fields (e.g. any character arrays or pointers) must be known to decide if memcmp is being used on null-terminated strings. \n\n- osal_key_t: the type of owner_key \u2014 needed to confirm that owner_key is not a character array or string subject to memcmp-based string comparisons. \n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: the constant written into owner_key \u2014 knowing its value/type helps confirm owner_key is not being treated as a string.\n\n- Any project-specific memcmp wrappers (e.g. OS_memcmp, OS_bcmp) if present: some codebases wrap standard functions; these wrappers must be inspected the same way as memcmp to detect forbidden string comparisons. \n\nTogether these symbols (the callee implementation, the memcmp symbol or wrappers, and the relevant type/constant definitions) provide the information needed to determine whether any memcmp in the call chain is comparing null-terminated strings, and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
