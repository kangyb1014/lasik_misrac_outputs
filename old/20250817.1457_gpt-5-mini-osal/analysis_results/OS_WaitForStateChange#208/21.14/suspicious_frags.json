  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp or any comparisons that operate on null-terminated strings in the provided code. The fragments only perform: assignments of an integer-like key type (osal_key_t), manipulation of OS_objtype_state entries, calls to OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl, pthread condition wait and mutex cleanup, and time calculations with struct timespec. None of these involve char* or string buffers or any direct/indirect string comparison using memcmp. The types shown (osal_key_t with a uint32 member, OS_object_token_t, OS_objtype_state_t, OS_impl_objtype_lock_t, timespec) are not string types, and no memcmp call or equivalent byte-wise compare is present in the supplied code. Therefore there are no fragments here that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If there are other source files not provided (e.g., implementations of OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex or other helper functions), those should be checked separately for memcmp usage comparing null-terminated strings."
