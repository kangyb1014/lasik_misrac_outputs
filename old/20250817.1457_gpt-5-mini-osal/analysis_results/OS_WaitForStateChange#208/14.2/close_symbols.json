The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_WaitForStateChange can violate the MISRA \u2018\u2018for loop shall be well\u2011formed\u2019\u2019 rule you must know all side effects and which objects it modifies (because the behaviour of a for loop body includes called functions). Each symbol below is required for that analysis:\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: the function called from the target. It may perform unlock/wait operations and may modify global/state objects that could be used as loop counters or loop\u2011condition objects; inspect its side effects.\n- OS_objtype_state (global array/table): the function indexes this table (objtype = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]) and writes to an element. You must inspect this global to see what objects are modified.\n- OS_objtype_state_t (type): to understand the layout and semantics of members (especially owner_key) and whether they could alias or be used as loop counters/condition objects.\n- owner_key (member of OS_objtype_state_t): this member is explicitly written (saved_unlock_key = objtype->owner_key; objtype->owner_key = ...). You must know its type/semantics to determine if it can be (or alias) a loop counter or a loop\u2011condition object.\n- OS_object_token_t (type): to understand token->obj_type (how it is passed in from callers), possible aliasing, and whether callers could pass a token derived from loop counters or objects used in the for condition.\n- token->obj_type (field): used to index OS_objtype_state; you must confirm its type/range and whether writing into the objtype element can affect objects used as loop counters in callers.\n- osal_key_t (type): the type of owner_key/saved_unlock_key \u2014 knowing whether this is an integer, pointer, or special type matters to determine if the write constitutes modification of a loop counter/condition.\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID (constant/macro): the value written into owner_key; needed to understand semantics (is this a special sentinel that callers might test in a loop condition?).\n- OS_ObjectIdConvertToken (caller): inspect the caller to see whether it (or other callers) invoke OS_WaitForStateChange from inside a for loop and whether loop counters or loop\u2011condition objects in those loops could be modified by this function (directly or via OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine what state this function (and its callee) modify and whether those modifications could violate MISRA constraints about loop counters and objects used in for loop clauses."
