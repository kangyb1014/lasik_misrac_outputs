  "explanation": "- OS_object_token_t: the full struct/typedef is required to see what members exist and whether this function writes through the token (i.e. any token->field assignments). If the function only reads token members, the parameter can be const-qualified.\\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: the prototype is needed to confirm whether this function (or an inline/implementation variant) receives the token (or a pointer derived from it) and could modify it; if the token is forwarded to a callee that requires a non-const pointer, const cannot be added.\\n- OS_objtype_state (global array): the declaration of the global array being indexed (&OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]) is needed to verify that the code is modifying the object-type table and not the token itself, and to check for possible aliasing issues.\\n- OS_objtype_state_t: the element type is required to see which fields are modified (owner_key) and whether those operations could alias or otherwise require token to be non-const.\\n- osal_key_t: the type of owner_key is needed to ensure the code assigns to owner_key (a separate object) and to check for any qualifiers that would affect const-correctness analysis.\\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: the constant/macro is needed to understand the assignment to objtype->owner_key and to confirm that the only mutation in the function is to the objtype state (not to *token)."
