  "explanation": "The parameter token is only read in this function (only token->obj_type is accessed) and the function does not modify the object pointed-to by token; therefore the pointer parameter should be investigated to see whether it can be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const OS_object_token_t *). Other pointers and references in the code do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - objtype is used to modify objtype->owner_key (assigning OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID and restoring saved_unlock_key), so it must point to a mutable OS_objtype_state_t (cannot be const). - The impl pointer refers to locking primitives whose state is modified by pthread_cond_timedwait and by the cleanup handler; these APIs require mutable objects (mutex/cond), so pointers to them cannot be const. - The addresses passed to pthread APIs (&impl->mutex, &impl->cond) are used for mutation by the threading primitives and therefore must be non-const. - saved_unlock_key and OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID are value types (not pointers) so Rule 8.13 does not apply. Hence only the token parameter and its use to index the table are suspicious for potential missing const qualification."
