  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function (or anything it invokes) could violate the MISRA rule about bounds when calling <string.h> functions, the next analyst must see any code that could call those string functions and the data definitions that affect pointer/array bounds and indexing:\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl: The target function delegates the wait/unlock to this implementation. If any string.h functions are used, they will most likely be in this implementation. The full implementation is required to inspect any use of memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc. and verify buffer/length arguments.\n\n- OS_object_token_t (type/struct definition): The target function indexes into OS_objtype_state using token->obj_type. The layout and field types of the token structure (and the valid range/semantics of obj_type) are needed to determine whether the index can go out of bounds or produce an invalid pointer that could later be used in string calls.\n\n- OS_objtype_state_t (type/struct definition): The target function accesses objtype->owner_key and the Impl function may access other members of the object-state structure (including pointers/buffers). Knowing the members and their sizes is essential to check any string operations against their bounds.\n\n- OS_objtype_state (global array / declaration and its size): The code uses &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]. The array declaration and its size (or the constant that defines its length) are required to confirm that token->obj_type indexing is within bounds, preventing out-of-range access that could feed into a string operation.\n\n- osal_key_t (typedef): owner_key is of this type. Knowing the typedef ensures correct interpretation of assignments and whether any pointer/aliasing could lead to invalid memory being passed to string functions.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID (macro/constant): The function writes this value into objtype->owner_key. The exact definition could be a special value (e.g., NULL or specific bit pattern) that influences subsequent code paths in Impl (or other code) which in turn may perform string/buffer operations. Understanding this value helps determine whether later code could dereference or treat the object/state as valid and then misuse string functions.\n\nProvide these symbols (code for the Impl and the full type/global declarations) to the next analyst so they can fully trace any string.h usage and verify correct buffer bounds and argument sizes."
