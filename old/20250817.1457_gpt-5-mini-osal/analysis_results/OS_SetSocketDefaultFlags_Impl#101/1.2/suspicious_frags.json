  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. All constructs are standard C and POSIX usage: function prototype and const qualifier, use of fcntl/F_GETFL/F_SETFL and O_NONBLOCK (POSIX), strerror(errno) (C/POSIX), the bool type (C99 <stdbool.h>), and the variadic macro OS_DEBUG which is a standard C99 feature. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro uses only standard address-of and array indexing operations. There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, implicit zero-length arrays, or other compiler-specific tokens. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 based on the supplied code."
