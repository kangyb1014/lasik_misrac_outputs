  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not appear to violate Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *token), the local pointer variable declaration (OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) is used to modify the underlying object (impl->selectable = true) so it legitimately points to a non-const type, and the uses of fcntl/strerror and the os_flags variable do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified. The only places where const-qualification could be lost or questioned are the macro definition (it takes tok and takes its address via &(tok)) and the call site that passes *token into that macro; these need inspection to ensure no const qualifier is being discarded."
