  "explanation": "Only the two calls that invoke strerror(...) are related to the <string.h> family in the provided function. These calls should be investigated to ensure the use of string-handling facilities does not lead to out-of-bounds accesses. All other fragments in the function are not uses of the <string.h> API and therefore do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: - Calls to fcntl(...) operate on integer file descriptors/flags, not string buffers. - Bitwise operations (os_flags |= OS_IMPL_SOCKET_FLAGS) and comparisons (os_flags == -1) do not involve string handling. - The assignment impl->selectable = true and the retrieval impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) do not involve string functions or pointer parameters to <string.h> functions. - The macro OS_IMPL_SOCKET_FLAGS is an integer constant (O_NONBLOCK) and unrelated to string buffer manipulation. Consequently, no other code fragments require investigation for Rule 21.17 compliance based on the supplied code."
