  "explanation": "No other code fragments require investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The remaining lines only declare local variables, call pthread_mutex_lock with the address of a member of the object obtained from the table, check the return value, and return constants \u2014 none of which modify the function parameter itself. The primary concern is whether the pointer parameter token is altered; there are no assignments to token in this function. However, the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET should be inspected (by others) to ensure it does not modify the pointer parameter or perform operations that would amount to modifying the parameter. If that macro is safe (does not assign to token or otherwise modify the parameter), then the rest of the function complies with Rule 17.8."
