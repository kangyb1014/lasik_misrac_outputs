  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in OS_MutSemTake_Impl. Reasoning: \n\n- The call to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is an expression used to obtain impl; its result is used and not discarded, so it is reachable and has observable effect (reads table entry). The macro expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))], and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken() takes the address of the token expression and returns a runtime index; there is no compile-time constant expression that would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- The call to pthread_mutex_lock(&(impl->id)) is executed unconditionally at runtime; its return value is stored to status and used directly in the following conditional. The if (status != 0) branch may be taken at runtime when pthread_mutex_lock fails; the else path (fall-through) is taken when it succeeds. Both outcomes are reachable depending on the return value, so neither branch is statically unreachable.\n\n- The function has two explicit return points: one inside the if (status != 0) and one at the end returning OS_SUCCESS. There is no code after the final return, so there is no dead code following a return statement.\n\n- No constant-condition constructs, unconditional jumps, or labels/gotos are present that would render any portion of the function unreachable.\n\nGiven the surrounding symbol definitions (table array, macro, struct, and constants), there is no indication of any compile-time or syntactic construct that yields unreachable code in this function. Therefore, no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
