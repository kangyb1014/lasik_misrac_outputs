  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_MutSemTake_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_MutSemTake_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int                              status;\n    OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_mutex_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n    ** Lock the mutex\n    */\n    status = pthread_mutex_lock(&(impl->id));\n    if (status != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_MutSemTake_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t OS_impl_mutex_table[OS_MAX_MUTEXES]\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_mutex_t id;\n} OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_SEM_FAILURE (-6)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (status != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the conditional is executed when pthread_mutex_lock fails (non-zero return). For example, if the mutex is invalid or not initialized (pthread_mutex_lock can return EINVAL) the function returns OS_SEM_FAILURE; removing this branch would change program behaviour."
