  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointer types could be const-qualified. The remaining fragments in the function are either non-pointer objects (ActualCopy, MaxSize), control-flow statements (if checks, return), or operations that modify the data structure (e.g. incrementing Position, calling UT_ClearStubEntry). Those are not candidates for adding const (they are scalar variables or require mutability), so they do not need to be investigated for this rule. Additionally, calls to helper functions (UT_GetStubEntry, UT_ClearStubEntry) are external and would be checked in their own definitions if needed; their usage here does not itself indicate a missing const qualification in local declarations."
