  "explanation": "No assignments or modifications of the function parameters occur in this function. Specifically:\n- FuncKey is only passed to UT_GetStubEntry and is not assigned to or modified.\n- LocalBuffer (a pointer parameter) is not reassigned or incremented; it is only used as the destination in memcpy. Writing to the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule, provided the pointer itself is not modified.\n- MaxSize is only read for comparison and is not modified.\nAll other assignments (ActualCopy, StubPtr, and StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position) affect local variables or objects reachable via local pointers, not the function parameters themselves, and therefore do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
