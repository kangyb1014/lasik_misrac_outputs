  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code consists exclusively of standard C constructs: a normal function definition and prototype, typedef-based identifiers (UT_EntryKey_t, UT_StubTableEntry_t) and standard type size_t, pointer and struct member access, array indexing, integer arithmetic and comparisons, and a call to the standard library function memcpy. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __inline__ (compiler-specific forms), typeof, statement-expressions ({: ... ; }), nested functions, Microsoft-specific keywords, GCC builtins, designated initializer extensions, or other vendor-specific tokens that compilers document as extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in this snippet."
