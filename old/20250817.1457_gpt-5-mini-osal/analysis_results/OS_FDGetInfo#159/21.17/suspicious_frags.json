  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 21.17 because they do not call or directly cause accesses by the string.h functions specified by the rule. The declarations and assignments (variable declarations, return_code handling, record = ..., fd_prop->User = ..., fd_prop->IsValid = true;, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdRelease, the if/return control flow) do not perform string buffer operations and therefore cannot by themselves cause out-of-bounds accesses under the string.h functions covered by this rule. The only locations in this function that invoke the Standard Library string/memory functions and therefore require examination are the memset and strncpy calls listed above."
