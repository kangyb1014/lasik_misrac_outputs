  "explanation": "To determine whether the strcmp call in OS_ModuleLoad_Static can access beyond object bounds you must know the provenance, types and termination guarantees of both pointer arguments and the table-sentinel logic: \n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t: needed to know the exact types of the Name and Module fields (char * vs const char *, any additional qualifiers) so you can reason about whether they point to valid C strings and their lifetimes. \n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE (the static symbol table object/macro): this identifies the start of the table used by the function. You must see its definition to know how the loop walks memory and whether the pointer arithmetic (++StaticSym) stays inside a valid array (avoids walking past the array bounds). \n\n- The static symbol table array entries and the storage the Module and Name pointers point to (the initializers): you need to inspect the actual table contents and the buffers or string literals referenced by Module and Name to verify that Module (when non-NULL) and ModuleName are null-terminated and sized appropriately so strcmp cannot read past their ends. Also confirm what sentinel is used (Name==NULL) and that it is present. \n\n- OS_ModuleLoad (caller / implementation): the caller supplies ModuleName. You must inspect that function to see whether ModuleName can be NULL or non-null-terminated, or whether it is validated/constructed in a way that guarantees strcmp safety. \n\n- strcmp (prototype/semantics from <string.h>): include the standard semantics (strcmp scans both strings until a NUL) so you can correctly reason that both operands must be valid NUL-terminated objects; knowing this lets you map the required guarantees back to the table and caller code.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether either argument to strcmp can be non-terminated, NULL, or point outside an object (or whether the table walk itself can run past the table), which are the conditions that would violate the MISRA rule about out-of-bounds string handling."
