  "scenario": "The single statement OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym = OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE; itself does not call any <string.h> functions and therefore does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, elsewhere in the function strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) is invoked: that call is only guarded against StaticSym->Module being NULL, but ModuleName is not checked. A violation of Rule 21.17 can occur at that strcmp call if ModuleName is NULL or if either pointer does not reference a properly NUL-terminated character array (causing access beyond the object bounds)."
