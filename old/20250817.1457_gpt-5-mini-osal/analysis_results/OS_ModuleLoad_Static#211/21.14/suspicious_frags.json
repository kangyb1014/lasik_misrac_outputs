  "explanation": "No use of memcmp was found in the provided function or related symbols. The code uses strcmp to compare null-terminated strings (strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) == 0), which is the appropriate standard library function for null-terminated strings and thus not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Other fragments (NULL checks, pointer increments, pointer-equality tests) do not involve memcmp and therefore do not need to be investigated for this rule. Note: memcmp would only be suspicious if used to compare null-terminated strings; comparing non-null-terminated buffers with memcmp (with explicit lengths) is outside the scope of Rule 21.14."
