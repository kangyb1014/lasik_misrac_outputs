  "scenario": "Not violated: OS_static_symbol_record_t is typedef'ed as a const-qualified struct (typedef const struct { ... } OS_static_symbol_record_t;), so the declaration OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym is a pointer to a const-qualified type. A violation would occur if the typedef lacked the const (e.g. typedef struct { ... } OS_static_symbol_record_t;) and the pointer were used only for reading \u2014 in that case it should be declared as a pointer to const (const OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym)."
