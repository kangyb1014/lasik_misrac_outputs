The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_static_symbol_record_t: The target function iterates over an array/pointer of this type and accesses its fields Name and Module. The MISRA for-loop rule refers to objects modified in the loop body and to the semantics of loop control flags and counters. To determine whether any object accessed or modified in the loop body (or via called functions) could act as or interact with a for-loop counter or be modified improperly, the precise types of the struct fields (e.g. whether Name/Module are pointers, volatile, const, or have non-trivial semantics) and any special attributes must be known.\n\nOS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: This global provides the initial value for StaticSym. Its declaration/initializer (e.g. whether it is an array, pointer to dynamically allocated memory, read-only table, or a sentinel-terminated list) is necessary to judge the effect of the pointer increment (++StaticSym) and whether that increment modifies or aliases other objects used in the loop body. The MISRA rule forbids loop counters or objects modified in the body to be used improperly; knowing how the iteration is performed and what ++StaticSym actually does is required to assess any potential rule violation.\n\nstrcmp: This function is called from inside the loop body. The MISRA rule states the behaviour of a loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement, and that the second/third clauses of a for must not use objects modified in the loop body. To prove there are no side effects that modify loop counters or other objects of interest, the called function's declaration and semantics (that strcmp does not modify its arguments and has no persistent side effects) must be known."
