  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of loop control. Although the function contains no 'for' statement, the loop control logic here (a while loop that advances the iteration pointer inside the loop body, use of break to terminate iteration, and a function call used in a loop condition) are the constructs that should be investigated to determine whether the intent of Rule 14.2 (single loop counter, no modification of that counter in the loop body except in the loop control clause, and no side-effecting expressions used as loop conditions) is satisfied or violated. Other code fragments in the function do not affect loop control and therefore do not need investigation for this rule: the initialization of return_code, the declaration and initialization of StaticSym = OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE, the assignments to return_code (other than the loop-related one already included), the final return statement, and the comments. These items are unrelated to the loop-control concerns of MISRA Rule 14.2 and so are not included as suspicious fragments."
