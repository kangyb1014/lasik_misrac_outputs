  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided code fragments. The function body only uses standard C constructs: typedef aliases (int32 -> int32_t), pointer iteration (++StaticSym), NULL checks, strcmp (standard library), function-pointer member in the struct, and macro aliases (#define OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE). The typedef of a const-qualified struct (typedef const struct { ... } OS_static_symbol_record_t) is legal standard C (not a compiler extension). There are no visible compiler-specific attributes, builtin functions, asm statements, pragmas, or other documented extensions in the supplied code. Note: the macro OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE (referenced via OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE) is not shown; if that macro or the symbol it expands to uses a compiler-specific extension, that expansion would need to be inspected \u2014 but based on the code provided, no extensions are present."
