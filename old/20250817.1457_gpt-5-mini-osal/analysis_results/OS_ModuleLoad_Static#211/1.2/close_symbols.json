  "explanation": "For verifying whether OS_ModuleLoad_Static uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect all externally defined types, objects and macros that the function relies on, because an extension could be hidden in their definitions:\n\n- int32: This is a typedef or macro for the integer return type. Its typedef/definition must be checked to ensure it is a standard typedef (e.g., from stdint.h) and not a compiler-specific built-in or an extension.\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t: The struct/type of StaticSym must be examined to see whether it contains any compiler extensions (anonymous structs/unions, GCC __attribute__ annotations, non-standard bit-field widths, packed/pragmas, flexible/zero-length arrays implemented as extensions, etc.).\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: The symbol providing the initial pointer must be inspected for its declaration/definition. It could be implemented with nonstandard storage-class specifiers, section attributes, or other compiler-specific annotations that are language extensions.\n\n- OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND and OS_SUCCESS: These constants (macros or enum values) must be inspected to verify they are simple standard macros/enum values and not defined via compiler-extension constructs or exotic macros.\n\n- strcmp: The use of strcmp requires its prototype to be visible; an implicit declaration (old C) or a nonstandard replacement could indicate usage of extensions. Confirm the standard declaration from string.h (or an explicitly provided prototype).\n\n- NULL: The NULL macro\u2019s definition should be checked (e.g., 0 vs ((void*)0)) in the project headers to ensure no nonstandard definition is used.\n\n- declaration attributes / compiler-specific keywords used in the above definitions (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, __packed__, __extension__): Many extensions are expressed via attributes or compiler-specific keywords in type/variable declarations. You must search the definitions of the items above for any of these tokens (or project macros that expand to them) because their presence would be a direct violation of the MISRA requirement against language extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions allows the next analyst to determine whether any nonstandard language extensions are present in the target function\u2019s dependent declarations."
