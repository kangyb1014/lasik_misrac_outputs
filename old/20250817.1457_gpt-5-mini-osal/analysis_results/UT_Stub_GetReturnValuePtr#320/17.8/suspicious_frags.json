  "explanation": "No function parameter in UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr is modified. Specifically:\n- FuncKey is only passed to UT_GetStubEntry and never assigned to or altered.\n- ReturnSize is only compared (used in the inequality check and cast for printing) and not assigned to.\n- TypeName is declared const char * and only used as an argument to strcmp and for printing; the pointer itself is not changed nor is any assignment made to it.\nThe code assigns to local variables (StubPtr, ReturnPtr) and accesses object members via pointers, which is permitted (the rule allows modification of the object pointed to by a pointer parameter but forbids changing the pointer parameter itself). Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
