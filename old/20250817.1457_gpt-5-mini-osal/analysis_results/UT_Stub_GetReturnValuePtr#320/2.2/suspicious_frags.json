  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were not marked as suspicious for dead-code investigation because they appear to be active, used operations or initializations that (a) are required for correct control/data flow or (b) are initializations which per MISRA Note 3 are not candidates for dead code. Specifically: - Variable declarations and typedefs shown in the additional code are necessary for type correctness and are referenced elsewhere. - The macro expansion for UtAssert_Failed and the definition of UtAssert_Abort/UtAssert_GetContext are used to report/assert errors; removing them would change behaviour. - Simple assignments that initialize variables before use (other than the single initialization flagged) were not flagged because initialization is explicitly excluded from dead-code consideration. - Comments and string literals are not executable code and thus not candidates. The selected fragments above represent places where executed operations (conditional branches, assignments, loop control, and update of shared limits) could be effectively inert in some configurations or call paths and therefore merit investigation to determine whether they constitute dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
