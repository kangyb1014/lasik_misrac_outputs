  "explanation": "I selected all locations where non-const pointers are introduced, returned or propagated (function return type, local pointer declarations, assignments from struct members, and the helper function that yields the table entry). These are the places that could violate Rule 8.13 if the pointed-to data is actually immutable and should be const-qualified. I did NOT flag: - parameters or arguments already declared const (e.g. the TypeName parameter is const char *), - uses of integral types or comparisons (Position, ReturnSize, Idx, SearchLen, etc.) since they are not pointer-to-object qualifiers, - the UtAssert_Abort/UtAssert_Failed calls (they accept const char * where needed), and - other obvious non-pointer expressions. Some pointers in this code may intentionally be non-const (for example when the buffer is meant to be written by callers), so only the listed fragments need investigation to confirm whether they should be const-qualified."
