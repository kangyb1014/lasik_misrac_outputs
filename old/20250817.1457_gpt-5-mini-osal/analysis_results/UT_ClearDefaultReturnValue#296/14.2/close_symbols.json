Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is required for analyzing MISRA 'well-formed for loop' conformance in the target function:\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry: This identifier is invoked in the target. It may be either a function or a function-like macro. If it is a macro, its expansion could introduce a for loop (or other loop constructs) directly into the target function body; if it is a function, its body might still contain for loops that are relevant only when called inside a for loop. You need the definition (or macro expansion) and prototype to determine whether it introduces or affects any for-loop behaviour or loop counters visible to the target.\n\n- UT_ClearStubEntry: This is called conditionally in the target. Like UT_GetStubEntry, it could be a macro that expands into loop code or a function whose implementation contains for loops. Obtain its definition/prototype to check if it introduces loops or side effects that could interact with any for-loop in the target.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t: The target stores the return of UT_GetStubEntry into a pointer of this type. Its typedef/definition is needed to confirm whether its declaration involves unusual constructs (e.g., arrays, embedded volatile objects, overloaded macros) that might affect analysis of side-effects or cause hidden loops via macros or inline functions operating on that type.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t: The function parameter type. Its typedef/definition is required to ensure it is a plain scalar (no macro trickery) and to exclude the possibility that passing it to UT_GetStubEntry uses side-effecting expressions or macros that might include loops.\n\n- UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT: This constant is passed as a second parameter to UT_GetStubEntry. If it is a macro expression (rather than a simple enum/const), its expansion might contain code with side-effects or loop constructs. The definition is required to rule out such expansions.\n\n- NULL: Used in the conditional check. NULL's definition (macro) should be checked to ensure it is a plain null pointer constant and not a suspicious macro that could expand to code with side-effects.\n\nIn short: obtain declarations/definitions (or macro expansions) of the two callees and the types/constants used in the call. This set lets an analyzer determine whether any for-loop constructs or side-effecting code are introduced into the target function (directly by macro expansion or indirectly by called functions) and therefore whether any MISRA for-loop rules could be implicated by the target function."
