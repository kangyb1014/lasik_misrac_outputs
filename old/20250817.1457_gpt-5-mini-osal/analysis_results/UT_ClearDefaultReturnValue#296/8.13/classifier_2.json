  "scenario": "The fragment itself (if (StubPtr != NULL)) does not violate Rule 8.13. The pointer StubPtr is declared as UT_StubTableEntry_t * and is subsequently passed to UT_ClearStubEntry(StubPtr), which presumably modifies the pointed-to object; therefore the pointer must not be const. A violation would occur if the function only read from the pointed-to object (no modifications anywhere) and the pointer were not const-qualified \u2014 in that case it should be declared as const UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr to satisfy Rule 8.13."
