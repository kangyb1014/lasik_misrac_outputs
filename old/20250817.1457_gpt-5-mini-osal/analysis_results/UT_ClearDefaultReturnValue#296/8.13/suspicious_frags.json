  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and their const-qualification. The only pointer token in this function is the local variable StubPtr and the places it is assigned/used; these are listed above and should be investigated to determine whether the pointer could/should point to a const-qualified type. Other parts of the function do not involve pointer declarations or pointer-to-object usage that would affect Rule 8.13: the function return type is void, the parameter FuncKey is not a pointer, the macro UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT is an integer constant argument, and the surrounding braces and control structure syntax are not relevant to const-qualification of pointers."
