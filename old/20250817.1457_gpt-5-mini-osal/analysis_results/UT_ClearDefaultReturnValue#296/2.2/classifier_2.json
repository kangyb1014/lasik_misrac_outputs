  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_ClearDefaultReturnValue:\n```c\nvoid UT_ClearDefaultReturnValue(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n\n    StubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT);\n    if (StubPtr != NULL)\n    {\n        UT_ClearStubEntry(StubPtr);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nvoid UT_ClearDefaultReturnValue(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n\n    StubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT);\n    if (StubPtr != NULL)\n    {\n        UT_ClearStubEntry(StubPtr);\n    }\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code performs a lookup (UT_GetStubEntry) and conditionally calls UT_ClearStubEntry only when StubPtr != NULL. These operations affect program behavior and are not executed redundantly; removing them would change behavior, so they are not dead code."
