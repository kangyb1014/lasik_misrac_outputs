  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_ClearDefaultReturnValue:\n```c\nvoid UT_ClearDefaultReturnValue(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n\n    StubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT);\n    if (StubPtr != NULL)\n    {\n        UT_ClearStubEntry(StubPtr);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nStubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the assignment calls UT_GetStubEntry and stores its return in StubPtr which is subsequently tested (if (StubPtr != NULL)) and used in UT_ClearStubEntry. Removing this assignment would change program behaviour (and likely cause undefined behaviour since StubPtr is a local variable). Therefore this operation is not dead code."
