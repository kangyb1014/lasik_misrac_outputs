  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter FuncKey is passed by value and is not assigned to or otherwise modified inside UT_ClearDefaultReturnValue. The local pointer StubPtr is a separate local variable (assignment to it does not modify FuncKey). Calling UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, ...) uses the value of FuncKey but does not itself indicate modification of the parameter here; even if UT_GetStubEntry returned or operated on a pointer internally, that would not constitute modification of the FuncKey parameter. The subsequent call UT_ClearStubEntry(StubPtr) may modify the object pointed to by StubPtr, which is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the pointer parameter itself must not be modified, but the object referred to may be). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
