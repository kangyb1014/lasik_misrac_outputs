Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other code fragments in this function do not appear to be dead and thus do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: the function signature and parameter list define the API (cannot be removed), the local declaration (bool IsCompatible;) provides required storage, the final return (return IsCompatible;) propagates the computed result, and the comments do not affect behavior. No other statements or branches outside the listed fragments are present that are obviously unreachable or redundant; the flagged fragments cover the places where assignments/branches might be redundant or overwritten and therefore merit investigation."
