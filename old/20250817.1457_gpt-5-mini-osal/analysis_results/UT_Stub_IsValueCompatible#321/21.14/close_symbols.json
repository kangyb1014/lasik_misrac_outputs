  "explanation": "- strcmp: The target calls strcmp; you must inspect its actual implementation or mapping in the build to determine whether it ultimately uses memcmp on null-terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule).\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp for null-terminated strings; check whether strcmp (or any wrapper) calls or is implemented as memcmp.\n- strlen: Some strcmp-to-memcmp implementations compute the length (via strlen) and call memcmp; presence of strlen in such a chain is evidence of memcmp-based string comparison.\n- __builtin_strcmp: Compiler intrinsics or builtins may replace strcmp with implementations that use memcmp; inspect these compiler-provided symbols too.\n- string.h (or project header that defines/overrides strcmp): A project header may #define or inline/replace strcmp with a memcmp-based routine; you need the header that provides the declaration/definition to detect such overrides.\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: The struct definition is needed to confirm that Rvc->TypeName is a conventional null-terminated C string (const char *) and not a length-tagged/binary buffer, which affects whether comparing via memcmp would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: The enum type for Genre is used in the function; its definition can show whether Genre values imply non-string binary payloads (relevant to deciding if TypeName is string data).\n- UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: The constant used in the conditional; knowing its intended meaning and value helps determine whether the code path deals with string contents or opaque/binary data.\n\nCollecting and inspecting these symbols (implementations, headers, and the UT types) lets the next analyst determine if strcmp in this build resolves to memcmp (directly or indirectly) and whether the compared operands are null-terminated strings \u2014 the two facts required to decide MISRA conformance for the rule about memcmp."
