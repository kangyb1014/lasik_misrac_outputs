  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related type definitions for use of compiler-specific or nonstandard language extensions. No constructs that are documented compiler extensions are present. Specifically:\n\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof (GCC extension), __int128, __extension__, or other vendor-specific extensions.\n- The boolean type (bool) is a standard C keyword since C99 (from <stdbool.h>), and size_t and strcmp are standard library items; their use is standard C.\n- The enum and struct declarations use only standard C syntax; the enumerator initializers (e.g. = 0, = 1) are plain standard values.\n- There are no inline assembly blocks, no pragma directives, no variadic macros, no designated initializers with nonstandard syntax, and no anonymous structures/unions in the shown code.\n\nThe identifiers int32, UT_RetvalBuf_t, and similar user types are not language extensions by themselves; they are (presumably) typedefs or user-defined types and do not represent compiler language extensions. If any of those underlying definitions (not shown) used compiler-specific extensions, those definitions would need to be reviewed, but based on the code provided there are no explicit language extensions to report."
