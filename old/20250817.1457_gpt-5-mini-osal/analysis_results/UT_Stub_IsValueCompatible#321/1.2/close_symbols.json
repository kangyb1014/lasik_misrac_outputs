  "explanation": "For determining whether this function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual definitions/resolutions of the identifiers and macros used in the function: \n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: need the full typedef/struct declaration to see whether it is implemented using any compiler-specific/extended constructs (packed attributes, non\u2011standard storage, extension typedefs, etc.).\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::TypeName: the member type must be checked to ensure it is a standard const char * (or if it is some non\u2011standard alias/macro/extension) because an extension here could make the code non\u2011conforming.\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::Genre: need the exact declaration of the member to see if it uses an extended type or attributes.\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: check whether this is a plain enum/typedef (standard C) or defined using compiler extensions (e.g., extended integer types, non\u2011standard bitfield width, compiler attributes, or macros that expand to non\u2011standard constructs).\n- strcmp: verify the symbol resolves to the standard C library function (declared in string.h) and is not a project/compiler extension/macro that changes semantics or uses non\u2011standard calling conventions.\n- NULL: check how NULL is defined in the translation unit (0, ((void*)0), 0UL, etc.) to ensure no non\u2011standard macro redefinition or extension is present.\n- bool, true, false: determine whether these come from the standard header (<stdbool.h> / C99 _Bool) or are project/compiler extensions (macros or typedefs introduced by the toolchain). Some toolchains provide non\u2011standard definitions for boolean types; that would be a language extension for MISRA purposes.\n- <stdbool.h> (or the project header that defines bool/true/false): inspect the actual include or replacement header to see whether standard definitions are used or replaced by non\u2011standard/extended definitions.\n- <string.h> (or the project header that declares strcmp): inspect the include/resolution to ensure strcmp is the standard library symbol and not a replaced/extended implementation.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions lets the analyzer determine whether any of the used types, macros, or library functions are provided via compiler or toolchain extensions (which would violate the MISRA rule) or are standard C constructs."
