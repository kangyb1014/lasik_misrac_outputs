  "scenario": "The fragment ensures both TypeName and WantTypeName are non-NULL before strcmp is called. Therefore it prevents a NULL pointer being passed to strcmp. If this check were absent and strcmp(Rvc->TypeName, WantTypeName) were called with a NULL pointer, that would violate Rule 21.17. As written, the fragment does not violate Rule 21.17 (note: it does not by itself guarantee the strings are properly null-terminated or within bounds, but that is outside the provided fragment)."
