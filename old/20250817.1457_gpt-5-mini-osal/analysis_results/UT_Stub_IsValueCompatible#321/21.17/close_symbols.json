  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about string.h functions reading beyond object bounds you must know exactly what pointers and buffers are being handed to strcmp and what guarantees exist about their termination/lifetime. Each symbol below is required for that reasoning:\n\n- strcmp: The function used in UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible. You need its exact semantics (reads both char arrays until a '\\0', possible reads up to and including the terminator) to judge whether a call can run past the end of the underlying object.\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: The full struct definition and any documentation/annotations. The code dereferences the Rvc pointer members; you must know member types and any invariants placed on the struct instance.\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::TypeName: The TypeName member\u2019s declared type and any contract (e.g., const char * pointing to a NUL\u2011terminated string, pointer into a buffer, optional/owned, lifetime). Whether TypeName always points to a valid NUL\u2011terminated character array is the central fact for deciding if strcmp can overrun memory.\n\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::Genre, UT_ValueGenre_t, UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: These determine control flow in the function (whether the strcmp branch executes). Knowing the enum layout and when Genre may be UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE or other values is needed to see whether the strcmp path can be avoided (and therefore whether a risky call can ever occur for real inputs).\n\n- All call sites of UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible (callers): To decide if Rvc can be NULL, if Rvc->TypeName can be non\u2011NULL but not NUL\u2011terminated, or if callers ever pass non NUL\u2011terminated buffers or pointers to interior/non\u2011string memory. Static callers reveal the actual argument values passed in practice.\n\n- All initializers/constructors/assignment sites that set UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t.TypeName: Code that creates or populates TypeName (string literals, strncpy targets, pointers into larger buffers) shows whether the stored pointer always references a NUL\u2011terminated string or might reference partial buffers (which would make strcmp unsafe).\n\n- All call sites / providers of the WantTypeName argument: Same reasoning as for TypeName \u2014 the pointer passed in must be a valid NUL\u2011terminated string for strcmp to be safe. Inspecting where WantTypeName comes from (callers) is necessary.\n\n- <string.h> declaration/contract for strcmp: To be explicit about the standard behavior and requirements (that strcmp reads both strings until a NUL is seen) and to match that behavior against the pointer invariants discovered in the above symbols.\n\n(You do not strictly need language-level NULL/bool definitions to assess out\u2011of\u2011bounds string accesses; the important facts are the provenance, lifetime and NUL\u2011termination guarantees of the char* arguments and the control\u2011flow conditions that guard strcmp.)"
