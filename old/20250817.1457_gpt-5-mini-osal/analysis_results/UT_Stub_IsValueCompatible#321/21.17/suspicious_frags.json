  "explanation": "No other fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not invoke or pass pointers into any <string.h> functions (there are no other calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, strcmp, etc.). The remaining statements (assignments to IsCompatible, the Genre comparisons, the return, and other control flow) do not perform string operations and therefore cannot cause accesses beyond the bounds of objects via the standard string functions covered by Rule 21.17. Investigators should focus only on the listed fragments which relate to string pointer parameters and the use of strcmp/type-name pointers."
