  "scenario": "Declaration of 'const char *TypeName' by itself does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The rule concerns uses of <string.h> functions (e.g. strcmp) that may access beyond object bounds. However, a specific violation scenario would be: if Rvc->TypeName (or WantTypeName) points to a buffer that is not NUL-terminated or points outside the valid object lifetime, then the subsequent strcmp(Rvc->TypeName, WantTypeName) call in UT_Stub_IsValueCompatible could read past the bounds and thereby violate Rule 21.17."
