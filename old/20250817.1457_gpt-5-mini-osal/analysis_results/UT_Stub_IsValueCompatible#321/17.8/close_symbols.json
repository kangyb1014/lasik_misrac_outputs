  "explanation": "UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: You must see the struct/type definition to know the exact types and const-qualification of its members (in particular TypeName and Genre). MISRA analysis needs to know whether accessing Rvc->... could be interpreted as modifying the parameter or its pointee and whether member types permit modification.\n(UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t).TypeName member type: Explicitly note the declared type of TypeName (e.g., const char * vs char *) to ensure the function is not attempting to modify the pointee via a non-const member or that the member access is only a read.\n(UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t).Genre member type: The declared type of Genre (e.g., UT_ValueGenre_t) is needed to confirm the comparisons do not perform hidden assignments or casts that could modify parameters.\nUT_ValueGenre_t: The typedef/enum definition is needed to know whether WantGenre is an scalar/enum type and to confirm that comparing or using it does not imply modification.\nUT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: The value/definition of this enumerator/macro is required to verify the comparison Rvc->Genre != UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE is a pure read and not a macro that expands to something with side effects (assignment, function call).\nstrcmp (declaration/semantics): The prototype/semantics (from string.h) are required to confirm that calling strcmp does not modify the string arguments or perform side effects that would count as modifying the pointer parameters.\nNULL (macro): Knowing how NULL is defined (e.g., ((void*)0) or 0) ensures the pointer comparisons against NULL are pure comparisons and not macros that could hide side effects.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine whether the function body performs any assignment to the parameter variables (Rvc, WantTypeName, WantGenre) or causes modifications of the objects they point to, and whether any used identifiers/macros expand to side-effecting code that would violate the MISRA rule."
