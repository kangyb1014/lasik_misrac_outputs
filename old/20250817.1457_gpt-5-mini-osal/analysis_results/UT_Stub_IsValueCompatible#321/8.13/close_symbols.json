  "explanation": "- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t: needed to see the exact declarations of the struct members used by the function so you can check whether any pointer members should be const-qualified.\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::TypeName (member): this is the critical symbol \u2014 its declared type (e.g. char * vs const char *) determines whether the code violates the MISRA advice that pointer fields used only for reading should point to const-qualified data.\n- UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t::Genre (member): confirm this member is not a pointer (so the const-pointer rule does not apply) and verify its type for completeness.\n- UT_ValueGenre_t: the enum/typedef for the Genre values is needed to understand Genre's type (pointer vs scalar) and the comparison semantics used in the function.\n- UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE: the specific enum constant used in the comparison; include it to fully resolve the Genre comparison and confirm Genre is not pointer-typed.\n- strcmp: include the prototype (from <string.h>) to confirm its parameter types (const char *), which is relevant to whether passing Rvc->TypeName or WantTypeName requires or changes const qualification.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether any pointer declarations in the called function (notably the TypeName member) ought to be const-qualified under the MISRA guideline."
