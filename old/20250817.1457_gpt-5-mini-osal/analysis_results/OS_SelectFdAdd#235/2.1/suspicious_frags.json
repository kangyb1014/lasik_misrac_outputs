  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided functions (OS_SelectFdAdd, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, OS_printf) and the related symbol definitions. I did not find any code that is provably unreachable based on the provided source: \n\n- OS_SelectFdAdd: The conditional that updates Set->object_ids depends on the runtime return value of OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex; both outcomes (true/false) are feasible at runtime, so the body is not statically unreachable. There is no code after an unconditional return or any dead statements.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex: All branches depend on runtime inputs (idtype, actual_type, max_id). No branch is determined always false/true by the visible constants. The function returns a value on all control paths; there are no statements after an unconditional return.\n\n- OS_printf: The two main branches depend on the runtime value of OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState and PrintfEnabled. The else-if structure is normal (mutually exclusive at runtime), not statically unreachable. The vsnprintf error/overflow handling branches are reachable according to the standard behavior of vsnprintf.\n\n- Macros: OS_CHECK_POINTER / BUGCHECK / BUGCHECK_VOID semantics are not fully shown. Their use is conditional on pointer checks and assertions; they may abort or otherwise transfer control on failure, but that does not make the following code statically unreachable (those paths are only taken on assertion failure). If verification needs to be exhaustive, the only places to double-check are the definitions of the BUGCHECK/BUGCHECK_VOID macros to ensure they do not expand to constructs that would make subsequent code unconditional dead code (for example, if they unconditionally longjmp/return in all cases). Given the supplied definitions and usages, there are no fragments that are provably unreachable and thus no fragments to mark for further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
