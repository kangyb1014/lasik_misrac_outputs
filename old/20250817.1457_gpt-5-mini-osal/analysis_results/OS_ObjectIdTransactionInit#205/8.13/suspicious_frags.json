  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer parameters/variables that could be to const-qualified types. In this function the only pointer is the parameter OS_object_token_t *token. It is explicitly written to (memset(token,...), assignments to token->fields) and then passed to OS_Lock_Global (which, given the usage, is expected to modify or depend on a non-const token). Therefore token cannot reasonably be const-qualified. There are no other pointer declarations or usages in this function that could be made to point to const-qualified types. Consequently no code fragments in this function require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
