  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because the rule targets use of <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and potential accesses beyond object bounds caused by them. The provided function contains no calls to any of these string handling functions and no buffer or string operations:\n\n- The only external operations are OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) (a table lookup/macro) and pthread_mutex_destroy(&(impl->id)). Neither involves <string.h> functions or string/buffer copying.\n- There is no pointer arithmetic, no manipulation of character arrays, and no use of memory copy/set/compare functions.\n- The return-value check on pthread_mutex_destroy is unrelated to string handling.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments in this function that need to be investigated for Rule 21.17."
