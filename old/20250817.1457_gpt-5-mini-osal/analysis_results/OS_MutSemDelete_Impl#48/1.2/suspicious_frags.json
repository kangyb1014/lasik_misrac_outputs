  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specific notes: \n\n- The function definition and declarations (int32 return type, pointers, const qualifier) use standard C constructs; int32 is a typedef of standard int32_t, not a compiler extension.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro uses standard preprocessor substitution, the address-of operator (&) and array indexing; these are standard C features, not extensions. The usage impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_mutex_table, *token); is macro expansion and pointer dereference\u2014standard behavior.\n- pthread_mutex_t and pthread_mutex_destroy are part of the POSIX threads API (library calls), not compiler language extensions. Their use does not constitute a language extension per MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2.\n- The return-value macros (OS_SEM_FAILURE, OS_SUCCESS) and comments are standard preprocessor and comment syntax.\n\nBecause none of the above rely on compiler-specific language extensions (such as __attribute__, typeof, asm, nonstandard keywords, or other documented compiler extensions), there are no fragments that need to be flagged for Rule 1.2 investigation."
