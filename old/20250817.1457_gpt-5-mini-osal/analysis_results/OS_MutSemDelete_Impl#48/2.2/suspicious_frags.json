  "explanation": "Fragments not listed have been reviewed and are not considered likely candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: the remaining typedefs, simple declarations, and the other switch cases invoke meaningful deletion or cleanup functions and are therefore observable in program behaviour. The inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is used by the macro and participates in indexing (so is not dead). Simple macro/constant definitions (e.g. OS_SEM_FAILURE, OS_SUCCESS) and the function headers/variable declarations are necessary for compilation and participant behaviour and thus are not reported. The listed fragments were chosen because they represent operations or interactions where the effect could be redundant, overwritten, unobserved, or otherwise candidates for being removable without changing program behaviour (and therefore merit investigation)."
