  "explanation": "Other fragments do not appear to violate Rule 8.13: the function parameter token is already a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *), so it meets the rule; the local pointer impl points to a mutable mutex record that is passed to pthread_mutex_destroy (which requires a non-const pthread_mutex_t *), so the pointed-to type cannot be const; the pthread_mutex_destroy call necessarily takes a non-const pointer as it modifies/destroys the mutex; the OS_impl_mutex_table array and the OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t structure represent modifiable OS state and thus cannot be const. The only places that could hide a const-qualification issue are the macro and its use above, since the macro takes the address of its tok argument and forwards that to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken \u2014 this can lead to discarding const-qualification depending on the expected parameter type of OS_ObjectIndexFromToken."
