  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified or they already use const where appropriate. Specifically:\n- The function parameter declaration int32 OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token) already uses a pointer to a const-qualified type.\n- Local scalar variable declarations (e.g. int status) and the return statements do not involve pointer const-qualification concerns.\n- The typedef of OS_object_token_t (shown as typedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t) is not a pointer type; its use as a const-qualified pointer in the function parameter is already present.\n- The call sites and simple assignments not involving pointers (other than those listed as suspicious) do not affect const qualification and thus are not relevant to Rule 8.13.\n\nThe listed fragments were chosen because they involve pointer usage, taking addresses via the macro, or point to non-const data structures and therefore should be inspected to ensure const qualifiers are not being discarded or omitted where they could/should be applied."
