  "explanation": "No unreachable code constructs were identified in the presented function. Reasoning:\n\n- Every statement in OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl is potentially reachable in normal control flow: the assignment to impl via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro is executed unconditionally, the call to pthread_mutex_unlock is executed unconditionally after that, and either of the two returns (OS_ERROR or OS_SUCCESS) can be reached depending on the runtime return value of pthread_mutex_unlock. There are no constant conditions, unconditional jumps, infinite loops, or labels that render any statements permanently unreachable.\n\n- The additional visible definitions (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken and the OS_impl_condvar_table array) do not introduce unreachable code in the shown function; the inline function is not used here, and the global table is accessed via the macro call which is executed at runtime.\n\n- There are no preprocessor conditionals, dead code branches, or unreachable labels shown in the provided snippets. Without additional code (e.g., a macro expansion that contains compile-time conditionals or non-returning constructs), there is no basis to mark any fragment as unreachable.\n\nTherefore, no code fragments need to be investigated for Rule 2.1 based on the provided sources."
