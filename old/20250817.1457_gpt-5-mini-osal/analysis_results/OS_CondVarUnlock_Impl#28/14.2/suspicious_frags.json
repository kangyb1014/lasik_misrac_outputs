First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-loops are present in the target function, its direct macro expansions, or the provided related definitions. Specifically:\n- OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl contains no for statement.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an array indexing expression (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) and does not introduce a for loop.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is an inline accessor (returns token->obj_idx) and contains no for loop.\n- The other provided symbols (the array definition, struct typedefs, and OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS macros) contain no for statements.\n\nTherefore there are no for-loop fragments in the shown code to investigate for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. (Implementation details of external library functions such as pthread_mutex_unlock are outside the provided code and not part of this source-level inspection.)"
