  "explanation": "I examined the provided function OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl and the related definitions. There are no uses of memcmp (or strcmp/strncmp) anywhere in the supplied code. The function only calls pthread_mutex_unlock on a pthread_mutex_t member of OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t; the related code shows an array of those records, a macro to index the array, and a token-to-index inline function. None of these symbols involve character buffers or null-terminated strings, nor do they call any standard-library string-comparison functions. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need to be investigated for Rule 21.14 (memcmp on null-terminated strings)."
