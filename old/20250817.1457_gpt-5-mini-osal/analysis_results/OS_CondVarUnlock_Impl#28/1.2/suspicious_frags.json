  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are present in the provided code fragment. Specific checks:\n\n- Function signature and types (int32, OS_object_token_t, OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t): these are user typedefs or application-defined types, not compiler language extensions. Typedefs and const qualifiers are standard C.\n\n- Variable declarations (int status; OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl;): standard C declarations, not extensions.\n\n- Macro usage (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);): a macro invocation itself is standard C. The macro definition is not provided here; if that macro uses compiler-specific extensions (for example GCC statement expressions, typeof, or attributes), that would need to be investigated, but the macro body is not part of the supplied code so it cannot be flagged from this fragment alone.\n\n- POSIX pthread call (pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mut);): use of POSIX threads is a platform/library API, not a language/compiler extension.\n\n- Return statements and constants (return OS_ERROR; return OS_SUCCESS;): standard C constructs; OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS are identifiers/macros that are not language extensions.\n\n- Additional array definition (OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t OS_impl_condvar_table[OS_MAX_CONDVARS]): a normal array definition; not a language extension.\n\nConclusion: based on the provided source lines there are no explicit compiler language extensions used. To be thorough, review the definitions of the macros and typedefs referenced here (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, int32, OS_object_token_t, OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t, OS_MAX_CONDVARS) and any compiler-specific headers or pragmas in the broader codebase; if any of those use documented compiler extensions (e.g., __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions, pragma with compiler-specific tokens), they should be reported then."
