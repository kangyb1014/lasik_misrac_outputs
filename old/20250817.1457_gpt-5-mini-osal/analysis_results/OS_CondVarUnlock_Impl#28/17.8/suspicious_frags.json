  "explanation": "No code fragments modify the function parameter token (the pointer itself). Details:\n- The function signature is int32 OS_CondVarUnlock_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token); token is a pointer parameter and there are no assignments to token (no statements like token = ..., ++token, or similar).\n- The macro call impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token); expands so that the index is computed via OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&( *token )), which is equivalent to passing token to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken. Taking the address of the dereferenced token does not modify the pointer parameter; it merely produces a pointer value for the inline function to read token->obj_idx.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token) only reads token->obj_idx (no writes), so the object referred to by the pointer is not modified by that function.\n- The rest of the function uses impl and calls pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mut); which does not modify the token parameter.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
