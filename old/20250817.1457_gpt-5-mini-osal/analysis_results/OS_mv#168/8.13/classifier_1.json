  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment as both src and dest are declared const char *. A violation would occur if the called function OS_rename were declared to take non-const pointers (e.g. int32 OS_rename(char *old, char *new)); in that case passing const char * would discard the const qualifier and violate the intent of Rule 8.13."
