  "explanation": "Only the fragments that involve pointer types or pass pointers to other functions need investigation for Rule 8.13. The function parameters and the calls that pass those parameters to OS_rename, OS_cp and OS_remove should be checked to ensure the called functions accept const-qualified pointers (i.e. their prototypes use const char *). All other lines (variable declaration of return_code, control flow, comments, return statement, and comparisons) do not involve pointer qualification and therefore do not need investigation for this rule."
