  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The sole function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token and the code does not assign to or perform pointer arithmetic on token. The code only dereferences *token to obtain a value for OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (a read), assigns local variables (status, impl), and calls pthread_mutex_unlock(&(impl->id)). None of these actions modify the pointer parameter itself. Therefore there are no places in this function that appear to violate the rule. (Note: if the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET were to expand in an unexpected way that attempted to modify its argument, that would be outside the visible code here; given the call uses *token (a value dereference), the function body as shown does not modify the parameter.)"
