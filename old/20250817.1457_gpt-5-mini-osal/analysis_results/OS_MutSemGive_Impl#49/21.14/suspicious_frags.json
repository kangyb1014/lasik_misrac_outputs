  "explanation": "I inspected the target function OS_MutSemGive_Impl and all provided related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp (direct or via the shown macros/wrappers). The code only uses pthread_mutex_unlock, array access via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, and a simple index extractor OS_ObjectIndexFromToken that returns token->obj_idx. The OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t contains only a pthread_mutex_t member (no character arrays or string operations). No other string-handling or memory-compare operations (memcmp) are present in the supplied code fragments, so there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14 in this input."
