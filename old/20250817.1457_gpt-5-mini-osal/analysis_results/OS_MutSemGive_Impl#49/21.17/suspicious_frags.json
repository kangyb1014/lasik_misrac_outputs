  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in OS_MutSemGive_Impl or in the related definitions provided. The function only calls pthread_mutex_unlock and accesses the implementation table via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro; neither involves the Standard string-handling routines constrained by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Although the table access (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) could be inspected for possible out-of-bounds indexing under other MISRA rules, it does not invoke any <string.h> functions and therefore is not relevant to Rule 21.17. Consequently there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 21.17 compliance."
