  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is assigned to in this function. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameters (console, Str, NextWritePos) themselves are not modified (no assignments like console = ..., Str = ..., or NextWritePos = ...).\n- pmsg is a local pointer initialized from Str and then incremented; this modifies only the local copy (pmsg), not the parameter Str.\n- The assignment *NextWritePos = WriteOffset modifies the object pointed to by NextWritePos, which the MISRA rule explicitly permits; the pointer NextWritePos itself is not altered.\n- Modifications to console->BufBase[...] modify the buffer object referred to by the console pointer, which is allowed; the console pointer variable is unchanged.\n- All other variables modified (WriteOffset, return_code, pmsg) are local variables.\nTherefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and no code fragments require further investigation under this rule."
