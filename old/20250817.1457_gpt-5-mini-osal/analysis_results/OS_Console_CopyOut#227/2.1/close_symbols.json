  "explanation": "- OS_console_internal_record_t (structure definition, including fields BufBase, BufSize, ReadPos): The function's control flow depends on the types, ranges and semantics of these fields. BufSize and ReadPos determine whether the WriteOffset wrap/compare and the \"out of space\" test (WriteOffset == ReadPos) can ever be true; BufBase type determines whether stores are valid. Also needed to know if any of these fields are declared volatile/const which affects side\u2011effects and reachability reasoning.  \n- OS_ConsoleWrite (caller implementation): To determine whether particular paths inside OS_Console_CopyOut are actually reachable in the project you must inspect how this function calls CopyOut (how Str and NextWritePos are initialized and what invariants are established on console). The caller may enforce invariants (e.g. BufSize>0, NextWritePos always != ReadPos) that make some branches unreachable.  \n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS, OS_QUEUE_FULL (macro/enum definitions): Knowing the values is necessary to check whether any return statements or return value tests could be simplified by constant folding or other project-wide constraints that would render code unreachable. Also useful for understanding which return path is taken in practice.  \n- int32 (typedef): To reason about return type semantics and any implicit conversions that might affect control/data-flow analysis.  \n- size_t (typedef): To reason about the behavior of WriteOffset arithmetic, comparisons with BufSize, and potential wrap-around; their widths and unsigned semantics are relevant to reachability of the branch that wraps WriteOffset to 0.  \n- true / bool definition (e.g. <stdbool.h> or macro): The loop uses while(true); confirming what \"true\" expands to ensures the loop is an unconditional infinite loop syntactically and that only break/return statements can exit it (important when checking for unreachable statements).  \n\nProviding these symbols allows the next analyzer to determine whether specific statements/branches inside OS_Console_CopyOut can never be executed given the actual project types, constants and caller-established invariants (MISRA \"no unreachable code\" analysis)."
