  "scenario": "Not violated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the fragment does not call any <string.h> functions (the rule applies specifically to those library functions). However, the code can still cause out-of-bounds reads if the caller passes a pointer Str that does not point to a valid, null-terminated character array (e.g. Str points to a buffer of length N with no '\\0' within bounds); in that case the loop\u2019s repeated '*pmsg' and '++pmsg' can read beyond the object, causing undefined behavior (a different safety issue but not a violation of 21.17)."
