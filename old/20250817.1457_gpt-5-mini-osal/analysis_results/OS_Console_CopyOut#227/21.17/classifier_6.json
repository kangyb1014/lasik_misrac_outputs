  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the code fragment does not call any string.h function (the rule targets use of standard string handling functions such as strcpy, memcpy, strlen, etc.). Therefore Rule 21.17 is not applicable. (Note: unrelated bounds issues are possible if console->BufSize == 0 or console->BufBase == NULL, in which case the assignment could access out-of-bounds, but that would be a different violation, not Rule 21.17.)"
