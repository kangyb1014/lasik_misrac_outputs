  "explanation": "Other code fragments in this function are simple initializations, control-flow constructs, return code assignments, and the final return statement; they do not perform pointer dereferences, index memory accesses, or manipulate string/byte buffers and therefore do not raise additional concerns under MISRA C Rule 21.17. The flagged fragments cover all places where the function reads from the input string (pmsg/Str), writes into the console buffer (BufBase/WriteOffset), or obtains/updates indices (NextWritePos/WriteOffset/BufSize/ReadPos) \u2014 these are the operations that can lead to accesses beyond object bounds and therefore must be investigated. No other lines perform memory accesses relevant to this rule."
