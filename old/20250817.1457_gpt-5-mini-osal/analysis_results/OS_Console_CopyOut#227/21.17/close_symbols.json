  "explanation": "For a bounds-safety (MISRA) analysis of OS_Console_CopyOut you need the following symbols and contracts:\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t (full struct definition): Required to know the exact names, types and layout of the fields used (BufBase, BufSize, ReadPos) and whether there are other relevant fields or alignment/padding rules.\n\n- console->BufBase (type and allocation/length): The analysis must know whether BufBase is an array embedded in the struct or a pointer to separately allocated memory, its element type (char, uint8_t, etc.), and the actual allocated length so that accesses console->BufBase[WriteOffset] can be checked against the real object bounds.\n\n- console->BufSize (value semantics and invariants): The code uses BufSize to bound WriteOffset. You must know the relationship between BufSize and the actual length of BufBase, whether BufSize can be zero, and any invariants (e.g. BufSize > 0) to determine if indexing and the >= check prevent out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- console->ReadPos (valid range and concurrency semantics): The function compares WriteOffset to ReadPos to detect full buffer. You need to know the valid range for ReadPos (0..BufSize-1?) and whether ReadPos can temporarily have values outside that range. Also whether ReadPos may be changed concurrently by other threads/ISRs (which affects whether the simple check guarantees safety at time of write).\n\n- Caller contract for *NextWritePos (valid range on entry): The function reads *NextWritePos and uses it directly for the first write before any bounds-wrap. The precondition on the incoming NextWritePos (e.g. 0 <= *NextWritePos < BufSize) is required to prove the initial write cannot index out of bounds.\n\n- Str parameter contract (pointer validity and NUL-termination): The code reads *pmsg repeatedly until a NUL. To ensure no out-of-bounds read of Str, you must know that Str points to a readable, NUL-terminated buffer (or its maximum length). Without that contract you cannot guarantee *pmsg accesses stay within the object referenced by Str.\n\n- Concurrency/locking specification for console object (who may update ReadPos/BufSize/BufBase concurrently): If other code can concurrently modify ReadPos, BufSize, or reallocate/free BufBase while this function runs, the per-access safety guarantees change. The concurrency model or required locking must be known to reason about potential races that could produce out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n(Types like size_t/int32 and the error-code constants do not affect buffer-bounds reasoning and are not required for this particular MISRA <string.h>-style bounds analysis.)"
