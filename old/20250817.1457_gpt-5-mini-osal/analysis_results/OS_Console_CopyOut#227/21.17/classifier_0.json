  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Rule 21.17 concerns the use of string.h library functions (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strlen). This code does not call any <string.h> functions; it performs manual pointer arithmetic. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated. (Note: separately, if Str is not a valid null-terminated string or is NULL, then ++pmsg combined with subsequent *pmsg dereferences could read beyond the bounds of the object \u2014 that would be undefined behavior but is not a violation of Rule 21.17 which only applies to <string.h> functions.)"
