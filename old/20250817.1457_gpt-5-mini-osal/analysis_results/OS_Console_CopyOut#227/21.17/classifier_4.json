  "scenario": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. The fragment does not call any <string.h> function, so Rule 21.17 is not applicable. The code wraps WriteOffset to 0 when it reaches console->BufSize, and the write to console->BufBase[WriteOffset] occurs only when WriteOffset is expected to be a valid index. (A separate, unrelated defect would occur if *NextWritePos were already >= console->BufSize, which would cause an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access \u2014 but that is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because no <string.h> function is used.)"
