  "scenario": "The fragment performs an index comparison (WriteOffset == console->ReadPos) to detect a full circular buffer; it does not call any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). Therefore Rule 21.17, which applies to use of string.h functions and preventing their out-of-bounds accesses, is not violated by this fragment."
