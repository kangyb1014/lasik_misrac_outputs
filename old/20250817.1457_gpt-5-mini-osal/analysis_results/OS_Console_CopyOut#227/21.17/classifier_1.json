  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement \"pmsg = Str;\" is a simple pointer assignment and does not call any <string.h> function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) causing out-of-bounds accesses; the assignment itself does not invoke those functions. (Note: subsequent dereferences or use of Str could still cause out-of-bounds behavior if Str is invalid or not NUL-terminated, but that is a separate correctness issue, not a direct violation of Rule 21.17 for this fragment.)"
