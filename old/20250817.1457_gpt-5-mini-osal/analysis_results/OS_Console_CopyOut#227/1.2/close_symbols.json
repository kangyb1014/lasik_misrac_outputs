  "explanation": "To determine whether the function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual definitions that appear in the translation unit rather than just the local code. Specifically:\n\n- OS_console_internal_record_t: The struct fields (BufBase, BufSize, ReadPos) and their types must be known to see if they use nonstandard types or attributes (for example pointer types, __attribute__ annotations, or compiler-specific integer types). Array indexing and wrap-around logic could rely on nonstandard types.\n\n- int32: This typedef may be a plain standard integer type (e.g., int32_t) or a compiler-specific extension (e.g., __int32, long long with attributes). You must inspect its definition to ensure it is not a compiler extension.\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS, OS_QUEUE_FULL: These macros or enum constants could be defined using extension syntax or nonstandard constructs; their definitions must be checked for use of compiler-specific tokens or attributes.\n\n- true: The code uses the identifier true. In standard C99/C11 this comes from <stdbool.h>; if the translation unit does not include <stdbool.h> then true might be a nonstandard macro or extension. You need the symbol/definition or the header inclusion to confirm it is standard.\n\n- size_t: Although standard, size_t is provided by standard headers. Confirming which header/typedef is used ensures no extension is being introduced for this fundamental type.\n\n- List of headers included by the translation unit: Many language extensions are introduced via headers (project or compiler-provided). Inspecting the included headers (and any private headers that define the above symbols) is necessary to detect any nonstandard macros, typedefs or compiler-specific constructs.\n\nProviding these symbols/definitions lets the next agent inspect whether any of the types, macros, or identifiers used by OS_Console_CopyOut are implemented using compiler-specific language extensions (e.g., __attribute__, __declspec, __int64/__int128, built-in keywords not in standard C, or nonstandard macro tricks)."
