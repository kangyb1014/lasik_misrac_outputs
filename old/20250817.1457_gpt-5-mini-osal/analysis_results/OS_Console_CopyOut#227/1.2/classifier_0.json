  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No rule 1.2 violation found. The use of \"while (true)\" itself is not a compiler language extension if \"true\" is the standard macro from <stdbool.h> (C99 and later). This is acceptable. A violation would only occur if the identifier/keyword \"true\" is provided by the compiler as a nonstandard extension (i.e. compiler documentation explicitly states that bare true/false are extensions) \u2014 in that case using it would violate Rule 1.2."
