  "explanation": "All other constructs in the function are standard C and do not in themselves indicate use of a compiler language extension: declarations (const char *, size_t, int32, user-defined types), pointer arithmetic and indexing (pmsg, console->BufBase[WriteOffset]), character literal/zero-termination check (*pmsg == 0), increments (++pmsg, WriteOffset = WriteOffset + 1), conditional statements and breaks, and return statements are ordinary C. The identifier int32 and the type OS_console_internal_record_t appear to be project typedefs rather than compiler language extensions. No compiler-specific tokens (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __extension__, GCC/Clang builtins) or other nonstandard syntax are present elsewhere in the snippet."
