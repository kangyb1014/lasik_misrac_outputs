  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Console_CopyOut:\n```c\nstatic int32 OS_Console_CopyOut(OS_console_internal_record_t *console, const char *Str, size_t *NextWritePos)\n{\n    const char *pmsg;\n    size_t      WriteOffset;\n    int32       return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    pmsg        = Str;\n    WriteOffset = *NextWritePos;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        if (*pmsg == 0)\n        {\n            /* String is complete */\n            *NextWritePos = WriteOffset;\n            return_code   = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n        console->BufBase[WriteOffset] = *pmsg;\n        WriteOffset                   = WriteOffset + 1;\n        if (WriteOffset >= console->BufSize)\n        {\n            WriteOffset = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (WriteOffset == console->ReadPos)\n        {\n            /* out of space */\n            return_code = OS_QUEUE_FULL;\n            break;\n        }\n\n        ++pmsg;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Console_CopyOut:\ntypedef struct\n{\n    char device_name[OS_MAX_API_NAME];\n\n    char *          BufBase;        /**< Start of the buffer memory */\n    size_t          BufSize;        /**< Total size of the buffer */\n    volatile size_t ReadPos;        /**< Offset of next byte to read */\n    volatile size_t WritePos;       /**< Offset of next byte to write */\n    uint32          OverflowEvents; /**< Number of lines dropped due to overflow */\n    bool            IsAsync;        /**< Whether to write data via deferred utility task */\n} OS_console_internal_record_t\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\n#define OS_QUEUE_FULL (-9)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nWriteOffset                   = WriteOffset + 1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is inside a while loop, not a for loop, so MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 (A for loop shall be well\u2011formed) does not apply. If this were a for loop where WriteOffset is the loop counter, modifying the loop counter inside the loop body (as in this increment) would violate clause 3/4 of Rule 14.2."
