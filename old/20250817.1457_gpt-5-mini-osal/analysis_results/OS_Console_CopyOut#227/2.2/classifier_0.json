  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Console_CopyOut:\n```c\nstatic int32 OS_Console_CopyOut(OS_console_internal_record_t *console, const char *Str, size_t *NextWritePos)\n{\n    const char *pmsg;\n    size_t      WriteOffset;\n    int32       return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    pmsg        = Str;\n    WriteOffset = *NextWritePos;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        if (*pmsg == 0)\n        {\n            /* String is complete */\n            *NextWritePos = WriteOffset;\n            return_code   = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n        console->BufBase[WriteOffset] = *pmsg;\n        WriteOffset                   = WriteOffset + 1;\n        if (WriteOffset >= console->BufSize)\n        {\n            WriteOffset = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (WriteOffset == console->ReadPos)\n        {\n            /* out of space */\n            return_code = OS_QUEUE_FULL;\n            break;\n        }\n\n        ++pmsg;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn_code = OS_ERROR;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The initial assignment \"return_code = OS_ERROR;\" is dead because every path that exits the while(true) loop assigns return_code (either OS_SUCCESS when the string terminator is found, or OS_QUEUE_FULL on buffer full) before the break. The value set by the initial assignment is never observed; removing it would not change program behaviour, so this statement violates Rule 2.2."
