  "explanation": "- OS_console_internal_record_t: Need the full struct definition to see the exact types and qualifiers of its members so we can determine whether the console pointer and its members are (or should be) const-qualified.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t.BufBase: This field is written to (console->BufBase[WriteOffset] = ...). Its declared type (e.g. char * vs const char * vs volatile char *) decides whether the code violates the MISRA guidance that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t.BufSize: Used in comparisons with WriteOffset (size_t). The declared type matters for compatibility with size_t and whether any implicit conversions mask const/qualification issues.\n- OS_console_internal_record_t.ReadPos: Compared to WriteOffset; its type and qualifiers affect whether making it const would be appropriate and whether pointer/element constness is respected.\n- int32: The typedef/definition is needed to confirm it is an integer type (not a pointer) so it does not introduce additional pointer-qualification concerns.\n- size_t: Confirm the exact definition used in this environment to ensure correct comparison semantics and to assess whether pointers to size_t (NextWritePos) are correctly qualified.\n\n(Other callers/callees in the static call graph are not required to evaluate this MISRA rule for the target function; the key information is the concrete definitions and qualifiers of the struct fields and the typedefs used.)"
