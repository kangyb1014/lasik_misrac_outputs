  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the source pointer pmsg is declared as const char * and is only read; console->BufBase is a non-const char * because the buffer is explicitly written to (console->BufBase[WriteOffset] = *pmsg). Making BufBase const would be incorrect since the code modifies the buffer. A violation would occur if a pointer that is only used for read access were not const (e.g., if Str or pmsg were declared as char * but only read), but that is not the case here."
