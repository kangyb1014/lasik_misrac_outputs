  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are most likely to be no-op or redundant in some build/configuration combinations (e.g. assertion/check macros that may be compiled out, diagnostic/debug calls that may be disabled, and an assignment that contradicts the documented allowance to call with NULL). Other code fragments were not selected because they perform essential, observable actions affecting program behaviour or are necessary bookkeeping: - The function-local variable declaration and the final return are required to return the result (not dead). - The call to OS_ObjectIdGetByName and the conditional checking of return_code are the primary control flow and produce observable effects (not dead). - The buffer truncation/terminator logic in OS_printf (the actualsz range checks and msg_buffer[actualsz] = 0) affect the produced output and bounds safety (not dead). - OS_ConsoleWrite is the observable side-effect of OS_printf (not dead). - Type definitions and constant macros (typedefs, OS_SUCCESS, OS_INVALID_POINTER, etc.) are declarations/constants, not executable code, and thus not candidates for dead-code under Rule 2.2. The fragments I listed should be investigated to determine whether they can/are compiled out or otherwise execute without effect (i.e. constitute dead code) in some configurations. No other executable statements in the provided snippets appear to meet the definition of dead code given the available context."
