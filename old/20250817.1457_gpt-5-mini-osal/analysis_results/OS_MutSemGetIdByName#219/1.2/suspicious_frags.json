  "explanation": "I did not find any use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragments. Reasons: \n- No compiler-specific keywords or attributes are present (e.g. __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, __cdecl, __stdcall, _Pragma, or other vendor-specific annotations).\n- The use of variadic functions (va_list, va_start, va_end, and vsnprintf) is standard C and not an extension.\n- The declarations and typedefs shown (int32, osal_id_t, function prototypes) use standard C syntax. The shown typedef line (\"typedef uint32 osal_id_t\") appears to be truncated/missing a semicolon in the snippet but that is a transcription/format issue, not evidence of a language extension.\n- Macros invoked (OS_CHECK_POINTER, BUGCHECK, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, BUGCHECK_VOID) are preprocessor macros; their definitions were not provided. There is no evidence in the call sites that they require compiler-specific extensions. If any of those macro definitions internally use compiler extensions, those implementations would need to be provided and reviewed \u2014 but based on the code shown there is no explicit use of language extensions.\n\nTherefore no code fragments from the supplied code need to be flagged for Rule 1.2. If you can provide the macro definitions (e.g. BUGCHECK, OS_CHECK_POINTER, ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, OS_ObjectIdGetByName, OS_ObjectIdRelease) or any build-specific headers, I can re-check them for compiler-specific extensions."
