  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages found relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameters are:\n- sem_name: declared as const char * (already const-qualified), so it complies with the rule.\n- sem_id: declared as osal_id_t * and is used to return an output value (passed to OS_ObjectIdFindByName). Because it is an output parameter, it must be a non-const pointer so the function can store the resulting ID; making it const would be incorrect. The OS_CHECK_POINTER macro and the call to OS_ObjectIdFindByName operate on these parameters in ways consistent with their intended use. There are no other pointer variables or pointer casts in the snippet that would warrant investigation under Rule 8.13."
