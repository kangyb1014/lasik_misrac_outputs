  "explanation": "For a correct MISRA dead-code analysis we must know which executed operations are actually necessary to observable program behaviour. Each listed symbol is required as follows:\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PageSize\n  - Determines the stack-size rounding arithmetic. Whether the rounding operations change behavior depends on this value (affects memory use/timing). Needed to decide if the rounding code is removable without effect.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities\n  - Controls the entire priority-configuration branch. To decide if that branch is potentially dead (never taken) we must know how/when this flag is set.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.SelectedRtScheduler\n  - Used to set the scheduling policy in the priority branch. Knowing its value/validity affects whether the setschedpolicy call (and associated attribute-work) is meaningful.\n\n- OS_PriorityRemap\n  - Called to compute the sched_priority. If this function has side effects or its result changes external behavior, the calls that depend on it are not dead. Must know if it is pure or stateful.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - Expands to logging/diagnostic actions in many error branches. Logging may be side-effectful (I/O, timing); to decide whether these OS_DEBUG calls are removable (dead) requires its definition.\n\n- OS_ERROR\n  - Return value used on failures. Needed to reason about control-flow and whether early returns prevent later code from running (affects whether later code is dead).\n\n- OS_SUCCESS\n  - Return value used at function end; needed to reason about observable return behavior.\n\n- PTHREAD_STACK_MIN\n  - Lower bound check for stacksz. If the constant equals zero or is never exceeded by inputs, the conditional and assignment may be dead. Must know its value.\n\n- PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE\n  - Argument to set detach state. If the platform defaults already match this, the call might be redundant; need value to decide.\n\n- PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED\n  - Argument to set inherit-sched attribute. Same rationale as above for possible redundancy/removability.\n\n- pthread_attr_init\n  - Initializes custom_attr; has side effects on the attr object and possibly errno. Removing the init would change behavior; its semantics must be known to decide removability of subsequent attr-related operations.\n\n- pthread_attr_setstacksize\n  - Applies the stack-size to the attr object. Starting the thread with a different stack size is observable; must know whether this call is required or redundant on the platform.\n\n- pthread_attr_setdetachstate\n  - Sets joinability attribute. Removing it may change thread semantics (detached vs joinable), so its side effects are relevant.\n\n- pthread_attr_setinheritsched\n  - Controls whether the explicit scheduling attributes are used. Its presence/absence changes whether subsequent sched settings take effect; needed to reason about the priority branch.\n\n- pthread_attr_setschedpolicy\n  - Sets scheduling policy (observable). Determine if this call or the entire policy-setting code is dead requires its semantics/value inputs.\n\n- pthread_attr_getschedparam\n  - Reads sched params into priority_holder; needed to know if reading/modifying these params has observable effect.\n\n- pthread_attr_setschedparam\n  - Applies modified priority_holder to attr; clearly observable if it changes thread priority. Must know semantics to assess deadness.\n\n- pthread_create\n  - Creates the thread (major visible side effect). This call is central: many later operations are explicitly non-fatal because the thread was created. To determine if subsequent operations are dead (e.g., attr_destroy logging), one must know that pthread_create succeeds/fails and what side effects remain.\n\n- pthread_attr_destroy\n  - Destroys attribute object; can free resources. Whether the destroy and its error logging are necessary or removable depends on its observable side effects on the process runtime.\n\n- strerror\n  - Produces the textual error messages passed to OS_DEBUG. Removing strerror-based logging may or may not be deemed dead depending on whether diagnostic output is considered observable behaviour in the project.\n\nIn summary, these symbols cover: the global flags that control branch reachability, the mapping function for priorities that could be stateful, the POSIX constants that determine whether calls change state, the pthread_* API calls that have observable side effects (thread creation, attribute mutation/destruction), and the logging/return-value symbols that influence whether error-handling/code after success/failure is functionally required. Without knowledge of these symbols/semantics you cannot confidently decide whether any executed operations in the target function are truly dead (removable without changing program behaviour)."
