  "explanation": "No other fragments in this function involve pointer declarations or pointer parameters that could be const-qualified. The remaining identifiers (filedes, nbytes, timeout, return_code, token) are either non-pointer scalar/object types or are already referenced only via the listed expressions. Macros and statements not listed do not introduce additional pointer targets that would need const qualification, so they do not require investigation for Rule 8.13."
