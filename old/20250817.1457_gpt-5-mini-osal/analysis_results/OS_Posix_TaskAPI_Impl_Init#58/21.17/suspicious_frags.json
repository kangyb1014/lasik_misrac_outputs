  "explanation": "The MISRA rule concerns calls to the standard string functions that accept pointer parameters (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) which can cause out-of-bounds accesses. In this function the only direct uses of such routines are the three memset calls listed above and thus they should be investigated. Other calls in the function (pthread_*, sig*, sysconf, signal, pthread_key_create, pthread_getschedparam, pthread_setschedparam, OS_DEBUG, etc.) are not string.h buffer-manipulation functions and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. The calls to strerror appear in debug/log messages but strerror does not take a caller-supplied pointer parameter that can be used for out-of-bounds writes by this code, so they are not relevant to this rule."
