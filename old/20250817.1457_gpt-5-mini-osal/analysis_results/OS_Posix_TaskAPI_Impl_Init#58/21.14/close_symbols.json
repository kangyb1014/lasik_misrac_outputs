  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for assessing the MISRA rule (no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings):\n\n- memcmp\n  - Direct target of the MISRA rule. Must be checked to see if it is called in this function (or via macros/inlined callees) to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams\n  - Callee from the target function. Its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp on NUL-terminated strings (violations in callees may be relevant to a whole translation unit review).\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - Logging macro/function used repeatedly with string arguments. Macro expansions or helper functions could use memcmp internally; examine its definition to ensure it does not compare null-terminated strings with memcmp.\n\n- strerror\n  - Returns C strings used in formatted messages. Although typically not implemented with memcmp, its implementation or wrapper could use memcmp; include to verify no prohibited usage in context.\n\n- errno\n  - Passed to strerror in an error path. Included to trace any string handling in error reporting paths.\n\n- memset\n  - Standard library function used here; included for completeness of external symbol set. Not directly related to memcmp rule but part of string/memory ops in the function.\n\n- pthread_key_create, pthread_getschedparam, pthread_setschedparam, pthread_self\n  - POSIX thread APIs called by the function. Their wrappers/macros/implementations could contain string comparisons; include to ensure no hidden memcmp usages affecting rule compliance for this unit.\n\n- sigfillset, sigdelset, sigprocmask, sigaddset, signal\n  - Signal API functions used; included to examine any macros/wrappers that may perform string comparisons in this build environment.\n\n- OS_NoopSigHandler\n  - Signal handler referenced via signal(). Its definition should be checked in case it performs any string comparisons incorrectly.\n\n- sysconf\n  - Used to get page size and later error reporting uses strerror(errno). Include to cover that path.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars\n  - Global struct referenced heavily (ThreadKey, MaximumSigMask, NormalSigMask, SelectedRtScheduler, PriLimits, EnableTaskPriorities, PageSize). Its type/definitions may include macros or inline functions that perform string operations; provide to next analyst for context.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t\n  - Type of PriLimits (fields PriorityMax/PriorityMin). Included to understand any inline or helper code that might perform string comparisons.\n\n- OS_impl_task_table\n  - Global memory cleared by memset in this function; included for completeness of symbols touched by the function.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY\n  - Constant used in comparisons that affect control flow. Include so the analyzer can see priority-range logic and any helper macros/inline code referencing it.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR\n  - Return codes used by the function; include so the analyzer can see full control-flow and error paths where string handling occurs.\n\n- SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR\n  - Scheduler policy constants used in selection logic; include to inspect any policy-related helpers.\n\n- SIGINT, SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGRTMIN, SIGRTMAX, SIGHUP\n  - Signal constants used in set manipulation. Included for completeness of signal-related paths that might touch string handling.\n\n- _SC_PAGESIZE\n  - sysconf argument used. Included to cover the sysconf usage path.\n\nRationale summary: To determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp on null-terminated strings, the analyzer must (1) confirm whether memcmp is invoked directly in this function, (2) inspect any macros or functions called (OS_DEBUG, OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams, OS_NoopSigHandler, etc.) that could expand to or call memcmp, and (3) examine any library wrappers or project-local implementations referenced (strerror, logging, or other helpers) that might perform prohibited comparisons. The symbols above are the minimal set of external identifiers referenced by the target function whose definitions or implementations should be provided to confidently assess compliance with the MISRA rule."
