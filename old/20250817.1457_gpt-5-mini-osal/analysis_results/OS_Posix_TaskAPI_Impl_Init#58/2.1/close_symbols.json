  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for unreachable-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams: Determines sched_fifo_valid/sched_rr_valid values used in the scheduler-selection branches. Needed to know whether those branches can ever be taken.\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE: Compile-time macro that controls inclusion/exclusion of the block that returns OS_ERROR when EnableTaskPriorities is false. This directly affects whether that return statement exists (compile-time unreachable vs present).\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: Global state struct used extensively (ThreadKey, MaximumSigMask, NormalSigMask, SelectedRtScheduler, PriLimits, EnableTaskPriorities, PageSize). Its members are assigned/read in multiple places; knowledge of its definition is required to determine whether code that uses or tests these members can be unreachable (e.g. tests against EnableTaskPriorities, assignments that may be redundant).\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t: Type of PriLimits and sched_*_limits (contains PriorityMin/PriorityMax). The numeric ranges/semantics of these fields are used in comparisons that select schedulers and adjust PriorityMax; these comparisons influence which branches are potentially reachable.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY: Constant used in priority-range comparisons. As a compile-time numeric constant it can make some comparisons always true/false and thus cause unreachable branches; must be known.\n\n- SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR: Scheduler policy macros used as parameters and values assigned to sched_policy/SelectedRtScheduler; required to understand which policy-selection branches are meaningful.\n\n- SIGRTMIN, SIGRTMAX: Compile-time or platform macros used as loop bounds in the for(sig = SIGRTMIN; sig <= SIGRTMAX; ++sig) loop. If their values make the loop empty at compile time the body could be unreachable; must be known.\n\n- SIGHUP: Signal macro used to remove from NormalSigMask and to install a handler; presence/definition can affect whether the signal-related statements are valid/meaningful.\n\n- OS_NoopSigHandler: Function used as the handler for SIGHUP via signal(); its declaration/availability determines whether that call is well-formed (affects compile-time diagnostics about reachability only if signal is a macro mapping to something else).\n\n- pthread_key_create: Called early; its return leads to an immediate return OS_ERROR if non-zero. Its semantics matter to determine whether the early-return path is feasible (though more of a runtime effect, its prototype and error model are relevant to reasoning about control flow).\n\n- pthread_getschedparam: Its return value selects whether the large scheduling block executes or the else-branch executes; while runtime, its possible nonzero return must be considered when deciding if the else path is reachable.\n\n- pthread_setschedparam: Return value is tested to break out of the do{ }while(0) and influences assignment to SelectedRtScheduler/EnableTaskPriorities; needed to reason whether code after it is reachable.\n\n- pthread_self: Called to get current thread for getschedparam/setschedparam; included to understand the function-call context but mainly to fully resolve pthread_getschedparam/setschedparam semantics.\n\n- sysconf and _SC_PAGESIZE: sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) is called and on failure the function returns OS_ERROR. sysconf is a runtime call but its possible failure makes that return path reachable; _SC_PAGESIZE is the compile-time argument macro.\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: Return-code macros used in multiple return statements; required to identify which return statements produce exits and therefore whether later code is reachable.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: Logging macro used in all error branches. Its expansion can affect whether certain statements are compiled (e.g., if it expands to nothing under some build modes) and thus may affect reachability in some build configurations.\n\n- OS_impl_task_table: The memset at the top touches this symbol; its presence/size is not critical for control flow but knowing its declaration helps ensure the initial memset is valid and not optimized away, which could affect statements preceding returns.\n\n- sigfillset, sigdelset, sigaddset, sigprocmask: Signal API calls used to build masks and set the mask. Their availability and semantics determine whether the sequence of signal-manipulation calls are valid and reachable in the build (in embedded/limited platforms these might be macros/no-ops).\n\n- strerror, errno: Used in debug messages when sysconf/pthread_* fail. errno/strerror are used to form error text; knowledge of errno semantics helps judge whether those branches are realistic and thus reachable.\n\nNote: Many of the above symbols (pthread_*, sysconf, OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams, etc.) represent runtime-dependent behavior; for MISRA unreachable-code analysis the critical items are compile-time macros/constants (OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE, OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY, SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMAX, SCHED_* macros, OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS) and any definitions/macros that can alter whether source statements are present or eliminated (OS_DEBUG, signal-related macros). The runtime-returning functions and global state are included because a full analysis needs to consider whether branches can be taken at run time (to avoid false positives where code is only unreachable under impossible runtime conditions)."
