  "explanation": "Only one use of a <string.h> function appears in the shown code: the call to memset. All other statements do not call any string.h functions (assignments, increments, iterator API calls, and the OS_CHECK_POINTER macro). The OS_CHECK_POINTER macro, as provided, expands to BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,...), so the pointer is checked for NULL before the memset is executed. The sizeof operand uses the declared pointee type (os_fsinfo_t) so the size argument is derived from the function parameter type. No other calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn are present in the provided function, therefore no additional fragments require investigation under Rule 21.17."
