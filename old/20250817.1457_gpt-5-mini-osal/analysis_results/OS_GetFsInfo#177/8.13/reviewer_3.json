Therefore 'base' could and should be declared as const OS_common_record_t * to prevent modification and satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (The 'arg' member may or may not be safely const depending on callbacks, but the non-const 'base' is a clear violation.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_GetFsInfo_Log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    va_list ap;\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1419.txt\", \"a\");\n\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* Attempt to create directory and retry once.

  "explanation": "The supplied OS_GetFsInfo implementation itself does not contain any pointer declaration that should be const-qualified, and nothing in the shown function dereferences or declares a member named 'base'. Agent A's claim concerns the internal definition of the iterator type (a member named 'base' of type OS_common_record_t *) rather than the code shown here. From the material provided it is not possible to demonstrate a MISRA Rule 8.13 violation in OS_GetFsInfo itself. \n\nIf the iterator implementation (the declaration of OS_object_iter_t and the functions OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit/GetNext/etc.) actually declares a pointer member 'base' as OS_common_record_t * and that pointer is only read (never written) then that iterator implementation could legitimately be flagged against Rule 8.13 and should be changed to const OS_common_record_t * (or otherwise justified). However, that iterator code is not part of the evidence supplied, so Agent A's report is not supported by the provided source for OS_GetFsInfo.\n\nTherefore the report as it applies to the shown code is not correct. To confirm or refute the underlying iterator claim you must inspect the iterator type and the iterator APIs (the definition of OS_object_iter_t, OS_common_record_t, and how they are used/modified)."
