  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_stat code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_stat.\n```c\nint32 OS_stat(const char *path, os_fstat_t *filestats)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    char  local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(filestats);\n\n    memset(filestats, 0, sizeof(*filestats));\n\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_FileStat_Impl(local_path, filestats);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:OS_strnlen(VirtualPath, OS_MAX_PATH_LEN) can read up to OS_MAX_PATH_LEN bytes from VirtualPath. The function only checks that VirtualPath is non-NULL (OS_CHECK_POINTER) and does not know the actual size of the object pointed to. If the caller passed a pointer to a shorter object (or a pointer close to an object boundary) that does not contain a '\\0' within the first OS_MAX_PATH_LEN bytes, OS_strnlen will access bytes beyond the bounds of the object -> out-of-bounds read.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\ntypedef int32_t int32;\ntypedef struct { unsigned long dummy; } os_fstat_t;\nextern int32 OS_TranslatePath(const char *path, char *local_path);\nextern int32 OS_FileStat_Impl(const char *local_path, os_fstat_t *filestats);\nstatic const int32 OS_SUCCESS = 0;\nstatic const int32 OS_INVALID_POINTER = -1;\nstatic void OS_stat_log(const char *stage, const char *path, const void *filestats, int32 return_code, const char *extra)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1375.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging cannot be opened, silently continue to preserve original behavior. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"[OS_stat] stage=%s return_code=%d path=%p filestats=%p\\n\", stage, (int)return_code, (const void *)path, filestats);\n\n    if (path == NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"[OS_stat] path is NULL\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* IMPORTANT: do NOT dereference `path` here.

  "explanation": "The provided OS_stat implementation does not itself call any <string.h> functions, so there is no direct evidence in this code that Rule 21.17 is violated. Agent A\u2019s scenario describes a plausible out\u2011of\u2011bounds read only if OS_TranslatePath (or some other callee) internally calls a string function such as strnlen with a fixed maximum and without ensuring the caller supplied a sufficiently large, NUL\u2011terminated object. Whether a violation exists depends on the (not supplied) implementation and the documented preconditions: either OS_TranslatePath must ensure its use of string.h functions cannot access beyond the object referred to by path, or OS_stat (and its callers) must guarantee path points to an appropriately sized, NUL\u2011terminated buffer. Because that implementation/precondition information is missing, the report that OS_stat (as shown) violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is not supported. If OS_TranslatePath does use strnlen/other string.h functions unsafely, the violation would be in OS_TranslatePath (or in a missing caller precondition), not provably in the OS_stat code shown."
