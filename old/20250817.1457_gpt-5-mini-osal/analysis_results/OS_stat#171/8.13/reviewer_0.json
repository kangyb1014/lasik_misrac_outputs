Therefore the pointer is not const-qualified where possible, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Recommendation: declare filesys as const OS_filesys_internal_record_t * (and ensure OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET yields a const pointer or is adjusted accordingly).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void os_stat_probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1371.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fflush(f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\nstatic void os_stat_dump_filestats(const char *stage, const char *path, const char *local_path, const void *filestats, unsigned long filestats_size, long return_code)\n{\n    os_stat_probe_log(\"[OS_stat] stage=%s path='%s' local_path='%s' return=%ld\", stage, path ? path : \"(null)\", local_path ? local_path : \"(null)\", return_code);\n\n    if (filestats != NULL && filestats_size > 0u)\n    {\n        const unsigned char *p = (const unsigned char *)filestats;\n        /* write as a single hex line */\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1371.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"[OS_stat] %s: filestats (%lu bytes):\", stage, filestats_size);\n            for (unsigned long i = 0u; i < filestats_size; ++i)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"%02X\", (unsigned int)p[i]);\n            }\n            fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint32 OS_stat(const char *path, os_fstat_t *filestats)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    char  local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    /* Initial probe: entry */\n    os_stat_dump_filestats(\"entry\", path, \"\", filestats, (filestats != NULL) ?

  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the shown OS_stat function. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 encourages using pointers-to-const when the pointed-to object is not modified. In OS_stat the filestats pointer is clearly used as an output/writable parameter: it is zeroed with memset(filestats, 0, sizeof(*filestats)) and subsequently passed to OS_FileStat_Impl(local_path, filestats) which is expected to populate it. Making filestats a pointer-to-const would be incorrect and break the function semantics. The agent\u2019s discussion about a filesys variable (OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys) refers to a different object not present in the provided OS_stat code; if that other code truly only reads the object, then qualifying that pointer const might be appropriate there, but that is a separate issue. For the provided OS_stat implementation the claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is incorrect."
