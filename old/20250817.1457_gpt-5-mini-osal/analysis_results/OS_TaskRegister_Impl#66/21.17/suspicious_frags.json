  "explanation": "Only calls to functions from <string.h> (or functions that access memory via pointer parameters from that header) are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The two fragments above involve use of string.h functionality: the memset() call and the call to strerror() (inside the OS_DEBUG invocation). Other code in the function does not call any <string.h> routines or perform pointer-based memory accesses governed by this rule: pthread_setcancelstate, pthread_setcanceltype, pthread_setspecific and the union member assignments are not string.h functions; passing arg.opaque_arg to pthread_setspecific is not covered by Rule 21.17. Therefore no other fragments warrant investigation under Rule 21.17."
