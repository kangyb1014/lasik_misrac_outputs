The pointer does not appear to be used to modify pointed-to data, so it could (and should) be declared as 'const void *opaque_arg'.

  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is speculative and not provable from the snippet. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to a const-qualified type when the pointed-to object is not modified through the pointer, but to demonstrate a violation you must show that the pointer member (opaque_arg) is never used to modify pointed-to data and that changing its type to const void * would not break other uses. The submitted code only shows a local union value being written via the id member and then the opaque_arg member being read and passed to pthread_setspecific (which takes a const void *). That single use alone is insufficient evidence that the non-const pointer is incorrect: the union member definition and all other uses across the codebase are not shown. It is entirely possible that opaque_arg is assigned elsewhere or used with APIs that require a non-const void *, in which case making it const would be inappropriate. Therefore the report as given is not correct. Recommendation: inspect the definition of OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t and all uses of opaque_arg; if it is never used to modify pointed-to data and never assigned to in contexts requiring a non-const pointer, then changing it to const void * would satisfy Rule 8.13."
