According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be const-qualified when possible (i.e. const void *). Therefore this use of a non-const pointer to supply a value that will not be modified violates the rule. (Fix: declare opaque_arg as const void * or otherwise supply a const-qualified pointer.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/531.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_TaskRegister_Impl(osal_id_t global_task_id)\n{\n    int32                    return_code;\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t arg;\n    int                      old_state;\n    int                      old_type;\n\n    /* Log entry and initial state */\n    probe_log(\"OS_TaskRegister_Impl: entry: global_task_id=%ld\", (long)global_task_id);\n\n    /*\n     * Set cancel state=ENABLED, type=DEFERRED\n     * This should be the default for new threads, but\n     * setting explicitly to be sure that a pthread_join()\n     * will work as expected in case this thread is deleted.\n     */\n    probe_log(\"Calling pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, &old_state)\");\n    pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, &old_state);\n    probe_log(\"pthread_setcancelstate returned old_state=%d\", old_state);\n\n    probe_log(\"Calling pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &old_type)\");\n    pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &old_type);\n    probe_log(\"pthread_setcanceltype returned old_type=%d\", old_type);\n\n    memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg));\n    probe_log(\"memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg)) completed\");\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    arg.id = global_task_id;\n    probe_log(\"Assigned arg.id = %ld\", (long)global_task_id);\n\n    /* Log the raw value of the opaque pointer before passing to pthread_setspecific */\n    probe_log(\"About to call pthread_setspecific with key=%p and value (opaque_arg)=%p\",\n              (void *)POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey, (void *)arg.opaque_arg);\n\n    return_code = pthread_setspecific(POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey, arg.opaque_arg);\n    probe_log(\"pthread_setspecific returned %d\", return_code);\n\n    if (return_code == 0)\n    {\n        probe_log(\"pthread_setspecific succeeded -> returning OS_SUCCESS\");\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Preserve original debug message but also log to file for repro */\n        OS_DEBUG(\"OS_TaskRegister_Impl failed during pthread_setspecific() error=%s\\n\", strerror(return_code));\n        probe_log(\"OS_TaskRegister_Impl failed during pthread_setspecific() error=%s\", strerror(return_code));\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    probe_log(\"OS_TaskRegister_Impl: exit: return_code=%d\", return_code);\n    return return_code;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_TaskRegister_Impl.

  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the evidence provided. MISRA C:2023 R.8.13 recommends that pointers be const-qualified when possible, but the mere fact that a void * is passed to a function expecting a const void * (pthread_setspecific takes const void *) is not itself a violation. In C it is permitted to convert a void * to const void * implicitly. To establish a R.8.13 violation you must show that the object/union member (OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t::opaque_arg) could and should be declared with a const-qualified type across all its uses. That requires inspecting the declaration of OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t and all uses of opaque_arg; if opaque_arg is later used to modify the pointed object, or is expected to be retrieved via pthread_getspecific (which returns void *), changing it to const void * may be inappropriate or incompatible. Given only the single function body, there is insufficient evidence to conclude the rule is violated. If an audit shows opaque_arg is never used to modify the pointee and can be made const consistently across the codebase, then changing its declaration to const void * would satisfy R.8.13. Otherwise the report is incorrect."
