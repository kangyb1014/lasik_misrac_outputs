Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TaskRegister_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskRegister_Impl(osal_id_t global_task_id)\n{\n    int32                    return_code;\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t arg;\n    int                      old_state;\n    int                      old_type;\n\n    /*\n     * Set cancel state=ENABLED, type=DEFERRED\n     * This should be the default for new threads, but\n     * setting explicitly to be sure that a pthread_join()\n     * will work as expected in case this thread is deleted.\n     */\n    pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, &old_state);\n    pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &old_type);\n\n    memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg));\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    arg.id = global_task_id;\n\n    return_code = pthread_setspecific(POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey, arg.opaque_arg);\n    if (return_code == 0)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"OS_TaskRegister_Impl failed during pthread_setspecific() error=%s\\n\", strerror(return_code));\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskRegister_Impl:\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\npthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &old_type);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call to pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &old_type) has an observable side effect (it sets the thread\u2019s cancelability type). Removing the call would change program behaviour (cancellation semantics/timing), so it is not dead code. The fact that the stored previous value (old_type) is unused does not make the call dead under Rule 2.2 (it may be an unused-variable issue, but not dead code)."
