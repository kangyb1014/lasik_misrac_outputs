Those writes (dead stores) are executed yet removing the variables and passing NULL instead would not change the program behaviour, so this is dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Fix: remove the unused variables and pass NULL or otherwise avoid the unused output parameters.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_TaskRegister_Impl(osal_id_t global_task_id)\n{\n    int32                    return_code;\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t arg;\n    int                      old_state = -1;  /* initialize to a sentinel to make logging safe */\n    int                      old_type  = -1;  /* initialize to a sentinel to make logging safe */\n    int                      rc_state;\n    int                      rc_type;\n    FILE                    *logf = NULL;\n\n    /* Open log file for appending probe information.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. old_state and old_type are only supplied as output locations to pthread_setcancelstate() and pthread_setcanceltype(), and their values are never read afterwards in the function. The writes that occur into those locals are therefore operations whose removal (i.e. passing NULL instead of an address or removing the locals) would not affect program behaviour; this matches the MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 definition of dead code (executed operations whose removal would not change behaviour).\n\nNotes / caveats:\n- POSIX explicitly allows passing NULL for the \u201cold state/type\u201d parameters, so changing the calls to pass NULL (and removing the local variables) is a straightforward fix on POSIX-compliant platforms.\n- If a non-POSIX or platform-specific pthread implementation required a non-NULL pointer (rare), then removing the locals could change behaviour; in that case the write would not be dead and the violation claim would not hold. You should confirm target-platform semantics before changing code.\n- If the locals are kept intentionally for diagnostic or historical reasons, keep them only if their values are actually used/logged; otherwise document and remove or explicitly avoid the unused-output-parameter writes.\n\nSuggested remediation: remove old_state and old_type and call pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, NULL) and pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, NULL), or otherwise ensure the returned values are consumed (logged, asserted, etc.)."
