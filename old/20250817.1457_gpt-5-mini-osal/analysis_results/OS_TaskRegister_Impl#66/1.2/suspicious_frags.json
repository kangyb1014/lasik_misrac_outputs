  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code. I inspected the function and the related definitions for common extension indicators (examples include: GCC/Clang attributes or builtins such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm__, typeof, __extension__, statement expressions ({ ... }), designated/unnamed compound literals that are compiler-specific, inline assembler, vendor-specific pragmas, or other documented compiler-only extensions). None of those appear.\n\nThe code uses POSIX thread APIs (pthread_setcancelstate, pthread_setcanceltype, pthread_setspecific) and POSIX macros (PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED); these are library/OS APIs (POSIX), not compiler language extensions and therefore are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as specified in your instruction. The cppcheck suppression is a comment for a static-analysis tool and not a compiler extension. The typedefs, union, macros, memset/strerror usage, and integer typedefs are standard C constructs, not compiler-specific extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments to flag for investigation under Rule 1.2."
