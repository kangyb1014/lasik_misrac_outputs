  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The sole parameter, FuncKey (typedef of cpuaddr), is passed by value and not assigned to or altered anywhere in the function. The only modifications are to a local pointer variable (StubEntryPtr) and to members of the object it points to (decrement/increment of StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter). Rule 17.8 concerns modification of function parameters (and forbids altering a pointer parameter itself); it does not prohibit modifying objects via local pointers. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 17.8."
