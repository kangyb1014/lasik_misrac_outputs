Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig can violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule (via side effects when used inside a for loop), the analyzer must know exactly what objects this function modifies and whether those objects could be used as a loop counter or loop-control flag in the caller. The required symbols and why they are needed:\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t (type/struct definition): The function dereferences a UT_StubTableEntry_t pointer and modifies fields within it. Knowing the full struct lets the analyzer identify which members are modified, their types, and whether they are global/shared objects that could be used as loop counters.\n\n- Data.Rvc and its member 'Counter' (declaration/type/qualifiers): The code performs --Counter and ++Counter. The exact type and qualifiers (signed/unsigned, volatile, atomic, bit-field, etc.) determine whether these are allowed loop-counter modifications and whether they have persistent side effects relevant to MISRA rules.\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry (function definition / implementation): UT_GetStubEntry returns the UT_StubTableEntry_t pointer. To determine aliasing and storage class of the returned object (e.g., pointer to global table entry vs. newly allocated/local object), the implementation must be inspected. Also UT_GetStubEntry might itself have side effects; those are part of the callee behaviour and relevant to the for-loop rule.\n\n- Global stub table(s) and storage accessed by UT_GetStubEntry (the array or container of UT_StubTableEntry_t): If UT_GetStubEntry returns pointers into a global/static table, then modifications of Counter modify global state. The analyzer must know the name/location/visibility of that storage to decide whether a caller's loop counter or loop-control flag could alias the same object.\n\n- UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_DEFERRED (macro/enum definition): The function calls UT_GetStubEntry with this selector. Knowing what this constant means may affect which entry UT_GetStubEntry returns (different storage/entry types) and hence which object is modified.\n\n- UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT (macro/enum definition): Same reason as above \u2014 different selection may yield a different entry kind with different lifetime/aliasing/semantics affecting whether modifications are relevant to loop control.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t (typedef/definition used for FuncKey): How FuncKey is used by UT_GetStubEntry (e.g., as an index, pointer, or handle) affects aliasing analysis: whether the same key could refer to an object used as a loop counter in the caller, or whether passing FuncKey has other side effects.\n\nCollecting these definitions lets the next analyzer determine (a) which objects are modified by UT_Stub_FindRetvalConfig (directly or via UT_GetStubEntry), (b) whether those objects have storage and visibility such that they could be used as loop counters or loop-control flags in a caller's for loop, and (c) whether the modifications are persistent side effects that would violate MISRA constraints on for-loop clauses."
