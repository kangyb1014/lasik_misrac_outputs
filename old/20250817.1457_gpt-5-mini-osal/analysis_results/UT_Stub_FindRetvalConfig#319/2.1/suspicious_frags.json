  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in this function. Reasoning:\n\n- The initial call to UT_GetStubEntry may legitimately return either NULL or non-NULL, so both the outer if (StubEntryPtr != NULL) body and the subsequent if (StubEntryPtr == NULL) branch are potentially reachable at runtime.\n- Within the first branch, decrementing StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter can produce either a value > 0 or <= 0 at runtime, so both outcomes of the inner if (StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter > 0) (setting StubEntryPtr = NULL) and falling through (keeping StubEntryPtr) are reachable depending on the counter value.\n- After that, the second lookup via UT_GetStubEntry(\u2026, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_CONSTANT) is only executed when StubEntryPtr == NULL, which can occur either because the initial lookup returned NULL or because the counter logic set it to NULL; that branch and its inner increment are therefore reachable.\n- There is no code following a return, no labels/gotos that cannot be reached, no constant conditional expressions that would make branches dead, and no constructs that imply compile-time unreachable statements.\n\nBecause every conditional and statement in the function can be reached under some valid runtime condition, there are no fragments here that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
