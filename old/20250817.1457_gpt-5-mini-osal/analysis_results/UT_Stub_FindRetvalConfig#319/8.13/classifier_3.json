  "scenario": "Not violated: StubEntryPtr is used to modify the pointed object (increments/decrements StubEntryPtr->Data.Rvc.Counter), so it must not be const-qualified. A violation would occur if the pointer were only used for reading; e.g. if StubEntryPtr were never used to modify its pointee, it should be declared as 'const UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubEntryPtr;'."
