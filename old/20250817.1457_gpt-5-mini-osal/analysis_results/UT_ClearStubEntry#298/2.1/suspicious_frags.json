  "explanation": "No code in UT_ClearStubEntry is provably unreachable. Reasoning:\n- There are no unconditional returns, goto labels, or infinite loops that would skip later statements; memset(StubPtr, 0, sizeof(*StubPtr)) is always executed and not preceded by a jump that makes it dead.\n- The free() call is guarded by a runtime condition combining EntryType, BasePtr != NULL, and ModeFlags & UT_MODEFLAG_ALLOC_BUF. None of these are compile-time constants in the provided context, so the branch can be taken at runtime (UT_MODEFLAG_ALLOC_BUF is defined as 0x1U, so the mask test can be non-zero). Therefore the free() statement is not unreachable.\n- The EntryType comparisons use two distinct runtime values; there is no evidence they are impossible simultaneously or that the condition is a constant false.\n- There is no unreachable label or unreachable block introduced by preprocessing in the shown code.\n\nNote: Dereferencing StubPtr when it is NULL would be undefined behavior, but that is not the same as unreachable code under MISRA Rule 2.1; it should be checked under rules concerning pointer validity and undefined behavior, not Rule 2.1."
