  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specific items that might be mistaken for extensions but are standard C and therefore do not trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2: \n\n- The static function specifier (static void UT_ClearStubEntry(...)) is standard C linkage/storage-class.\n- The NULL macro and pointer comparisons (BasePtr != NULL) are standard.\n- The bitwise operator and mask check ((StubPtr->ModeFlags & UT_MODEFLAG_ALLOC_BUF) != 0) are standard C.\n- The integer suffix 0x1U is standard C numeric literal syntax.\n- Using sizeof(*StubPtr) is standard C; sizeof can take an expression and is not a language extension.\n- The calls to free() and memset() are standard C library functions, not compiler language extensions.\n- Comments (/* ... */) and the if/then syntax are standard C constructs.\n\nNo compiler-specific keywords or constructs are present (for example: no __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembly, or other vendor-specific extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2."
