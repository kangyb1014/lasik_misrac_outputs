  "explanation": "The only standard <string.h> function used in this function is memset; therefore any potential MISRA Rule 21.17 violation will involve the memset call and the code that can affect the object addressed by its first parameter. The if-condition and free call preceding the memset are included because freeing StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr could, in some object layouts, deallocate memory that overlaps StubPtr (for example if BasePtr points into or at the same address as the UT_StubTableEntry_t object) or otherwise affect the validity/extent of the object that memset writes to. Other lines in the function (the comment, the function signature, the EntryType and ModeFlags comparisons, and the NULL-check on BasePtr) do not invoke <string.h> functions and do not by themselves cause out-of-bounds accesses by string.h functions, so they do not need investigation for Rule 21.17."
