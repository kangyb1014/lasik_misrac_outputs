  "explanation": "No fragments to investigate: the function does not modify the pointer parameter StubPtr itself (no assignment such as StubPtr = ..., no increment/decrement, no re-binding). It only modifies the object pointed to (*StubPtr) \u2014 calling free on a nested pointer value and then memset'ing the pointed-to object \u2014 which is explicitly permitted by the MISRA note (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified). The use of sizeof(*StubPtr) is safe because sizeof does not evaluate the operand. Therefore there are no violations of Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
