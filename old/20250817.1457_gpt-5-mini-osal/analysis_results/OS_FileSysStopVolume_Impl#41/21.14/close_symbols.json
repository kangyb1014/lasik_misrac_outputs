  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of the standard memcmp function to compare null-terminated strings. Confirming whether memcmp is referenced (directly or via macros) in the target function or any inline/expanded code reachable from it is essential.\n\n- OS_memcmp: Many projects provide wrapper functions or macros around standard library calls (naming like OS_memcmp is common). To be sure the rule is not violated via an aliased/wrapped call, any project-specific wrappers that map to memcmp must be checked.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The target function takes a pointer to this type. An analysis must verify whether any code in the function (or any inlined/expanded code) mistakenly treats fields of this token as null-terminated strings and compares them with memcmp. Having the type definition lets an analyst see whether string data is present and how it might be (mis)used.\n\n- OS_FileSys_Initialize and OS_rmfs: These are the static callers of OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl (from the provided call graph). While a caller's use of memcmp does not make the callee itself violate the rule, including the callers allows the analyst to quickly verify whether any inlining, macro expansions, or unusual preprocessing could cause memcmp usage to appear in the compiled body of the target function (or whether the target might be modified/templated in ways that introduce memcmp). They also provide context to ensure the target truly performs no string comparisons.\n\nIf present in the codebase, also check any other macros/aliases that expand to memcmp (e.g., wrappers in platform/unit-test code) so that indirect uses are not missed."
