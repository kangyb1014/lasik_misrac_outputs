  "explanation": "No occurrence of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided code fragments. The code uses strncpy and strncmp (e.g. strncpy(filesys->volume_name, ...), strncmp(filesys->volume_name, OS_FILESYS_RAMDISK_VOLNAME_PREFIX, ...)) which are not memcmp; strncmp is intended for string comparison with an explicit length and strncpy for copying, so they do not trigger Rule 21.14. The OS_CHECK_STRING and OS_CHECK_PATHNAME identifiers are macros, but their expansions were not provided; nothing in the shown code calls memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments here that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
