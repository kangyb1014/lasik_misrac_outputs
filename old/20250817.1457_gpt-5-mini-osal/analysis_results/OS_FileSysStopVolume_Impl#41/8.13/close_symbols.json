  "explanation": "1) OS_object_token_t (typedef/struct definition): Required to know what the identifier actually is (an object, a pointer type, an opaque handle, etc.). The meaning of the function parameter const OS_object_token_t *token depends on the underlying typedef: if OS_object_token_t is itself a pointer type (e.g. typedef foo *OS_object_token_t), then const OS_object_token_t * is pointer-to-pointer and the const does not protect the ultimate pointee. To assess whether the pointer should point to a const-qualified type you must know the true type layout.\n\n2) Prototype/declaration of OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl (public header): Confirm the published prototype (header) matches the implementation and that const qualification is intended in the API. A discrepancy between header and implementation can produce const-correctness issues or violations.\n\n3) Definition/prototype of OS_FileSys_Initialize (caller): This caller is in the static call graph of the target. Inspecting its prototype and implementation shows how it obtains and passes the token (whether it treats tokens as mutable or const), and whether it relies on semantics that would be incompatible with a const-qualified pointee type.\n\n4) Definition/prototype of OS_rmfs (caller): Same rationale as above \u2014 this caller passes tokens to the target; its implementation shows how tokens are created, modified, or passed and whether const qualification would be appropriate or surprising in context.\n\n5) Call sites in OS_FileSys_Initialize where a token is created/passed: The exact places where the token value is produced or manipulated (e.g. calls to OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, etc.) are needed to determine whether the underlying object is ever modified and thus whether making the pointee const is correct.\n\n6) Call sites in OS_rmfs where a token is created/passed: Similarly, inspect the token construction and any pre/post-call modifications to determine whether the pointee is intended to be mutable.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine (a) what the parameter actually points to, (b) whether the implementation or API expects modification of the pointee, and (c) whether the const qualification in the implementation is correct or missing according to the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
