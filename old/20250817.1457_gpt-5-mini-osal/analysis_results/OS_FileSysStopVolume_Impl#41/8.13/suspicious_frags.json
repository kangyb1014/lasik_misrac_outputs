  "explanation": "The only pointer in this function is the parameter declaration 'const OS_object_token_t *token', which already points to a const-qualified type and therefore complies with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer variables, pointer casts, or pointer usages in the function body (the function is a no-op returning OS_SUCCESS), so no additional fragments require investigation under this rule."
