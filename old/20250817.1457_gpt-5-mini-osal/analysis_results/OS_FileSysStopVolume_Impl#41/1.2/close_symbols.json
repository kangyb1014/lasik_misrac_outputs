  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule banning compiler language extensions you must inspect any symbols that could hide compiler-specific extensions via macros, typedefs or declarations. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: This is the literal returned by the function. If OS_SUCCESS is a macro or enum that expands to or is defined using a compiler extension (for example a builtin, GCC/Clang __attribute__, __extension__, asm, or a non-standard constant), that would be a violation. Inspecting its definition is required.\n\n- int32 (typedef/alias): The function uses the type name int32 as its return type. That name may be a typedef or macro that maps to a compiler-specific type (e.g. a non-standard integer type or compiler-specific storage class). You must examine the typedef/macro to ensure it is a standard C type and does not rely on extensions.\n\n- OS_object_token_t (type definition for the parameter): The parameter type may itself be a typedef or struct that uses compiler-specific extensions (packed attribute, non-standard bitfields, pragma, __attribute__, __declspec, compiler-specific implementation-defined types). Its definition must be checked for any language extensions.\n\n- OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl (external declaration/prototype): There may be a separate declaration or macro-wrapped prototype in a header that applies attributes or macros to the function (for example OS_API, visibility or calling-convention attributes like __attribute__((...)) or __declspec). The header-level declaration must be checked for such extensions even if the local definition appears plain.\n\n- Any macros included/expanded in the translation unit headers that are used in the signature or return expression (e.g. OS_API, OS_EXTERN, attribute macros): Some projects centralize compiler-specific extensions behind macros. You should scan the headers for any macros used in signatures or type definitions that expand to compiler-specific keywords or attributes. If such macros expand to compiler extensions, the MISRA rule would be violated.\n\nTogether these symbols cover the places where compiler-specific language extensions can be hidden (macros, typedefs, attributes, declarations). Inspecting their definitions lets the next analyzer determine whether the function uses any compiler-specific language extensions."
