  "explanation": "To prove compliance with the string.h bounds rule you must confirm that the target function does not, directly or indirectly via macros/typedefs, invoke any string functions. Specifically: \n- OS_SUCCESS: verify this symbol is a simple integer constant or enum and not a macro or inline that expands to code that calls string.h functions. \n- OS_object_token_t: inspect the full typedef/struct definition to ensure it does not contain embedded inline functions, compound initializers, or macros that perform string operations on its members. If the type contains character arrays or methods/macros that manipulate strings, those must be checked. \n- int32 (typedef): ensure this return type is a straightforward integer typedef (no weird macro/function). \n- Header(s) that define OS_SUCCESS and OS_object_token_t: include the actual header files (translation unit) so any macros, inline functions, or header-level code that could call string.h routines are visible. \n- Any file\u2011local macros/inline functions referenced in this translation unit (e.g. UNUSED_PARAMETER): these macros sometimes expand to code; they must be inspected to confirm they do not call string functions.\n\nNo other functions are called by OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl itself, so checking the above symbols (and the headers that define them) is sufficient to determine whether this function (or macros/typedefs it uses) violate the string.h bounds rule."
