The if (should_format) { return_code = OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl(&token); } only assigns OS_SUCCESS to return_code (no side-effects); removing this call would not change program behaviour in the current project, so it constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    /*\n     * Preserve original behavior: this function is a documented no-op and\n     * must return OS_SUCCESS.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The claimed offending call (an if(should_format) { return_code = OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl(&token); } fragment) does not appear in the provided OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl source \u2014 the function shown is a simple, documented no-op that just returns OS_SUCCESS. MISRA Rule 2.2 defines dead code as code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The provided function body is executed when the function is called and returns a value; it is not (from the snippet) an executed operation whose removal would be behaviourally neutral. Agent A also conflates two different pieces of code (the reported dead call to OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl versus the actual OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl body). The added logging test neither proves the function is dead (the empty log only shows the test did not exercise the routine) nor is it a valid transformation for proving/removing code (it changes behaviour by adding I/O). Finally, even if a called helper were currently implemented as a no-op, removing a call can still change observable behaviour (timing, side-effects in other builds, future changes) \u2014 and MISRA requires careful justification before treating executed code as dead. Therefore the agent A report is incorrect."
