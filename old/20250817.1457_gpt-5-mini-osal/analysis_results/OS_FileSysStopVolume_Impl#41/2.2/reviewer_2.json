  "explanation": "The agent's report is not supported. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead code only when an operation is executed yet its removal would not affect program behaviour. The provided function is an intentionally empty implementation that returns OS_SUCCESS. From the evidence given we cannot conclude that removing the function (or the call) would not change program behaviour: even a no-op call can have observable effects (timing, ordering, interactions with concurrency or external observers), and the rule's own note (1) explicitly warns that timing can determine embedded behaviour. The agent did not demonstrate that the function is both executed and that its removal would have no effect; their probe attempt produced no log entries (suggesting the function might not even be executed in the tested configuration). Also, if the function is never reached then it would be unreachable (and note 2 distinguishes unreachable from dead code). Determining a Rule 2.2 violation requires project\u2011level proof that the operation is executed and provably removable without behavioural impact; that proof is absent. Therefore the reported violation is not correct."
