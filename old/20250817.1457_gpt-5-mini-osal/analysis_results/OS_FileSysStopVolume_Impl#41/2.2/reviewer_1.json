  "explanation": "Not correct. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour, but the mere presence of a no-op implementation is not sufficient proof that the call is dead code for the project as a whole. The report's argument is incomplete: it assumes that removing the call cannot change any observable behaviour, but that must be established across the whole system (including timing, errno, stack effects, API/portability contracts and other configurations). In many projects an empty platform-specific implementation is an intentional stub required by the abstraction (or retained for future/other-platform behaviour) and is therefore not 'dead' in the MISRA sense unless you can demonstrate that every observable effect (including side\u2011effects like timing or interactions with other modules) is unchanged by removing the call. The provided evidence (an attempted logging build whose logs were empty) does not prove the call is harmless to remove. If you can prove the function has no side effects in any configuration and that removing all calls would not affect the product, then the code would be dead and should be removed or formally justified; as presented, the report does not establish that and so the claimed violation of Rule 2.2 is not supported."
