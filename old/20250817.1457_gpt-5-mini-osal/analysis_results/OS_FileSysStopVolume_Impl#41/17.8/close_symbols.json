  "explanation": "1) OS_object_token_t: You must inspect the typedef/structure for this symbol because the meaning of the const in the parameter declaration depends on how OS_object_token_t is defined. If OS_object_token_t is a plain struct type (e.g. typedef struct X OS_object_token_t), then const OS_object_token_t *token is a pointer to const object (the pointed object is const). If OS_object_token_t is itself a pointer typedef (e.g. typedef struct X *OS_object_token_t), the const binds differently (const OS_object_token_t *token can become a pointer to a const pointer), which affects whether the function could legally modify the pointer target or the pointer value. Determining the exact type is essential to decide if any modification in the function would violate MISRA\u2019s \u201cparameter shall not be modified\u201d rule. \n\n2) OS_SUCCESS: The function returns OS_SUCCESS. Include this macro/constant definition to ensure it is a simple constant and not a macro with side effects (for example a macro that expands to an expression that could modify the parameter or perform other hidden operations). Verifying OS_SUCCESS confirms the return statement does not silently modify the token parameter. \n\n3) int32: The return type alias should be checked (typedef) to confirm it is a plain integer type and not a macro/typedef with unusual semantics that might hide side effects. This is typically not a modification source, but including it ensures there are no surprising macro expansions or attributes that could change behavior relevant to parameter modification."
