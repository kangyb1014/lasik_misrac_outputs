  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter is declared as a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token), so neither the pointed-to object nor the pointer is modified in the body. The function body contains no assignments, increments/decrements, casts, or operations involving 'token' \u2014 it is a no-op that simply returns OS_SUCCESS. There are no const-to-non-const casts or other hidden modifications, and the related symbols (OS_object_token_t typedef, OS_SUCCESS macro, int32 typedef) do not indicate any parameter modification. Therefore no code fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
