The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_SUCCESS \u2014 The function returns this symbol. To be sure the target function contains no hidden loop behaviour or side effects relevant to MISRA for\u2011loop rules, the analyzer must know whether OS_SUCCESS is a plain constant/enum/macro or if it expands/invokes code with side effects (e.g. a function call or an expression that could include a loop or modify objects used as loop counters).\n\nOS_object_token_t \u2014 The parameter type of the function. While a type normally has no runtime behaviour in C, the analyzer should see its definition to rule out any unusual macros or typedefs that could expand to code (or involve inline functions/macros) at the call site or prototype that might introduce loop behaviour or object modifications relevant to the MISRA rule."
