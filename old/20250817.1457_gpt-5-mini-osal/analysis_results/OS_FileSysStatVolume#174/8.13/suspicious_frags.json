  "explanation": "Other fragments do not warrant investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter 'const char *name' is already const-qualified; 'OS_statvfs_t *statbuf' is an output buffer and therefore legitimately non-const; the parameter checks (OS_CHECK_PATHNAME, OS_CHECK_POINTER) do not change pointer qualification; the use of 'token' and its address (&token) pass non-const object/token addresses where mutability is required; calls to OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl and OS_ObjectIdRelease use parameters whose qualifiers are appropriate for their intended use. Therefore these other fragments do not indicate a likely violation of the requirement that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
