  "explanation": "The remaining code uses only standard C language constructs and project-defined types/macros (local variables, switch/case, bitwise operators, return statements, pointer dereference, struct member access, and the OS_* macros that are project constants). The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a normal macro expansion (no compiler-specific extension). Types and identifiers such as int, int32, bool, and the typedefs shown are standard C or project-defined and do not by themselves indicate use of compiler language extensions. The constant OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS and other OS_* symbols are project-defined configuration macros/consts. No other constructs (inline assembly, __attribute__, typeof, statement-expressions, zero-length arrays, compiler-specific keywords or pragmas, or other documented compiler extensions) are present in the remaining code fragments, so they do not need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
