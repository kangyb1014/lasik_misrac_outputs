  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. Specifically:\n- The pointer parameter token is only dereferenced (*token) and its contents are used to index the object table; there is no assignment to token itself. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to use &( *token ) which yields the original pointer value but does not modify the parameter. OS_ObjectIndexFromToken merely reads token->obj_idx and does not modify the token or its pointee.\n- The local_path parameter is passed to open() (which takes a const char *); it is not modified by the function.\n- The scalar parameters flags and access_mode are only read (used in bit tests and a switch) and never assigned to.\n- All writes in the function target local variables or the OS_impl_filehandle_table entry (impl->fd, impl->selectable). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer is permitted by Rule 17.8; no pointer parameter itself is altered.\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in this function that violate or need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
