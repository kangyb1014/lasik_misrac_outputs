  "explanation": "I have reported fragments that could indicate unreachable code or overlapping defensive checks that should be investigated for Rule 2.1: (1) the switch default in OS_FileOpen_Impl and (2) the access_mode validation in OS_OpenCreate are directly related \u2014 if OS_FileOpen_Impl is only ever called from OS_OpenCreate, the switch default may be unreachable. (3) The block that sets O_CREAT when flags indicate create is suspicious because the comment indicates a create with read-only access \"does not make sense\" (possible contradictory call paths). (4) The selectable assignment depends on O_NONBLOCK being present in os_perm; whether that bit can ever be set here should be checked (otherwise the assignment may be effectively dead/unreachable-to-be-true).\n\nWhy other fragments were NOT selected:\n- The individual switch cases (OS_WRITE_ONLY, OS_READ_ONLY, OS_READ_WRITE) are legitimate reachable branches for valid access_mode values and should not be considered unreachable without further evidence that these values can never be passed at runtime.\n- The open(local_path, ...) call and the error-handling branch (impl->fd < 0) are normal runtime behavior (open can fail) and therefore reachable.\n- The assignments to os_perm for O_TRUNC and the OR with OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS are standard flag-building code and are potentially reachable depending on flags/definitions; they are not provably unreachable from the provided code.\n- Macro usages (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_DEBUG) and the token/table handling are standard and have no obvious unreachable code in the provided excerpts.\n\nIf further proof is available that OS_FileOpen_Impl is never called except via OS_OpenCreate (or that certain flag constants can/cannot be set), the flagged fragments should be revisited to determine whether they are truly unreachable and must be removed or refactored to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
