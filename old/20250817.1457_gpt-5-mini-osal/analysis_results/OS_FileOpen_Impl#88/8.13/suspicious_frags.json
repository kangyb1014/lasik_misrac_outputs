  "explanation": "Fragments not included (and thus not flagged) were assessed as not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - The function parameters are already const-qualified where appropriate (const OS_object_token_t *token and const char *local_path), so they do not require further investigation for missing const. - Local scalar variables (os_perm, os_mode) and switch/case logic do not involve pointers and are outside the scope of Rule 8.13. - Use of strerror() is a standard library call returning a (non-modifiable) string; only its use in the debug call is present and no pointer-to-modifiable data is retained. - Macro invocation of open() itself is fine with a const char * argument (local_path is const). The listed suspicious fragments are those that involve obtaining a pointer to a table element (macro + impl declaration/assignment) and subsequent writes through that pointer (assigning to impl->fd and impl->selectable), and the table/ macro definitions that determine whether the pointer types should have been const-qualified. These should be investigated to ensure that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
