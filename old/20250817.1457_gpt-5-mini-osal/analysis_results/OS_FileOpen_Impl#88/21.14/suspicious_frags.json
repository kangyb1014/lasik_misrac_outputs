  "explanation": "I inspected the provided OS_FileOpen_Impl implementation and the related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp anywhere in the function or the provided supporting code/macros. There are also no other raw memory comparison operations of null-terminated strings (for example, no use of memcmp(local_path, ...), nor any indirect call that could resolve to memcmp). The only string usage is passing local_path to open() and to OS_DEBUG(), and OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro here, so it does not perform any comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
