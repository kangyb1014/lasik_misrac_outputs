  "explanation": "I inspected the target function and the related definitions for compiler language extensions documented as extensions by common compilers. I found none of the following compiler-specific or nonstandard language features: no use of compiler intrinsic keywords or identifiers such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (compiler-specific form), __typeof__, typeof, __extension__, or other vendor-specific keywords; no inline assembly; no nonstandard storage-class specifiers or pragmas; no use of compiler-specific builtins. The code uses standard C constructs (typedefs based on stdint types, ordinary macros, standard C99 'static inline' functions) and POSIX API types/functions (struct timespec, clock_settime, CLOCK_REALTIME) which are platform/library APIs, not compiler language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If you want me to treat POSIX APIs as a potential issue, state that explicitly and I will flag their use."
