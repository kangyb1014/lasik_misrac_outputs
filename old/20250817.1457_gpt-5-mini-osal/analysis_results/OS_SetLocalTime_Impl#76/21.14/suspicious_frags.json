  "explanation": "I examined the entire provided code for OS_SetLocalTime_Impl and the related inline helper functions. Rule 21.14 concerns use of the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. There is no use of memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or any other C string-comparison functions in the target code. The function OS_SetLocalTime_Impl only performs: - integer arithmetic (OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds, OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart) - assignments into a struct timespec - a call to clock_settime (a time API) - a status check and return of an error/success code The shown inline helpers perform only integer arithmetic and casts (division, multiplication, and a cast to uint32/int64). There are no char arrays, char pointers, or string comparisons present. Therefore there are no code fragments that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the provided code."
