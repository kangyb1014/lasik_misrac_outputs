Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SetLocalTime_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SetLocalTime_Impl(const OS_time_t *time_struct)\n{\n    int             Status;\n    int32           ReturnCode;\n    struct timespec TimeSp;\n\n    TimeSp.tv_sec  = OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds(*time_struct);\n    TimeSp.tv_nsec = OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart(*time_struct);\n\n    Status = clock_settime(OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK, &TimeSp);\n\n    if (Status == 0)\n    {\n        ReturnCode = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ReturnCode = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return ReturnCode;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SetLocalTime_Impl:\nstatic inline int64 OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds(OS_time_t tm)\n{\n    return (tm.ticks / OS_TIME_TICKS_PER_SECOND);\n}\n...\nstatic inline uint32 OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart(OS_time_t tm)\n{\n    return (uint32)OS_TimeGetFractionalPart(tm) * OS_TIME_TICK_RESOLUTION_NS;\n}\n...\n#define OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK CLOCK_REALTIME\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int64 ticks; /**< Ticks elapsed since reference point */\n} OS_time_t\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\ntypedef int32_t   int32\n...\nint32 OS_SetLocalTime(const OS_time_t *time_struct)\n{\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(time_struct);\n\n    return OS_SetLocalTime_Impl(time_struct);\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nTimeSp.tv_nsec = OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart(*time_struct);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the assignment stores the nanoseconds part into TimeSp.tv_nsec which is then used in the call to clock_settime(&TimeSp). Removing this assignment would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code. (A violation would occur if the field were never used \u2014 e.g. if TimeSp.tv_nsec were overwritten before use or the structure were not passed to clock_settime \u2014 then the assignment would be dead code.)"
