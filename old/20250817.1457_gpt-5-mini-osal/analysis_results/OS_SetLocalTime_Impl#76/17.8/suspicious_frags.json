  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function modify the function parameter. The parameter is declared as const OS_time_t *time_struct, so the object pointed-to is read-only in this function; only read accesses occur (the expressions *time_struct passed to OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds and OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart). There is no assignment to or arithmetic on the parameter variable time_struct itself (no reassignments like time_struct = ..., no increment/decrement, no pointer arithmetic). The helper functions shown take OS_time_t by value, so they do not modify any pointer parameter here. The only object modified is the local TimeSp variable (and it is passed by address to clock_settime), which is not a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
