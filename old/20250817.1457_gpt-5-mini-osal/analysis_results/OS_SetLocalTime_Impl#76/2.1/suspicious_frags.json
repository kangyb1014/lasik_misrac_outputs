  "explanation": "The listed fragments are those that involve control flow or external return values that could make branches unreachable (the call to clock_settime and the consequent if/else, together with the macros that define the compared/assigned constant values). All other lines in the function are simple assignments or uses of inline helper functions that contain no conditional statements or alternative control-flow paths (for example the TimeSp.tv_sec/tv_nsec assignments and the inline OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds/OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart definitions). Those other fragments therefore do not present an apparent unreachable-code issue under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 and need no further investigation for that rule."
