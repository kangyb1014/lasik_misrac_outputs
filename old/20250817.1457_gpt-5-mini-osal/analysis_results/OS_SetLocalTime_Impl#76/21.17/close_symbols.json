This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds: This callee is invoked with *time_struct. Its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not call any <string.h> functions (or otherwise perform out-of-bounds memory accesses) that would violate the MISRA rule.\n- OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart: Same as above \u2014 its implementation must be checked for any use of string.h functions or buffer accesses that could cause out-of-bounds operations.\n- clock_settime: The standard syscall/library function called here. Verify its prototype and semantics to ensure no indirect use of string.h functions or copying of memory from the provided timespec that could violate the rule (and to confirm the expected types/parameters).\n- OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK: Macro/constant passed as first parameter to clock_settime; include to check whether it expands to any code that could invoke string functions or affect arguments.\n- struct timespec (definition): The target fills tv_sec and tv_nsec fields and passes the address to clock_settime; the definition is required to confirm field types/sizes and to ensure no hidden buffer/aliasing issues relevant to out-of-bounds memory accesses.\n- OS_time_t (definition): The input pointer is dereferenced and passed to the two time helper functions. Its layout and semantics are needed to ensure those calls do not cause implicit copies or pointer shims that involve string functions or buffer accesses.\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR: Result constants used for return; include to confirm they are simple integer macros/values and do not expand to expressions or function calls that might use string.h functions.\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule targets use of <string.h> functions leading to out-of-bounds accesses. Although the shown function has no direct calls to string.h, its callees or any macros/constants used here might. Providing the implementations/definitions of the listed symbols lets an analyst determine whether any string handling functions are used (directly or indirectly) or whether any of these symbols expand to code that could cause out-of-bounds buffer accesses."
