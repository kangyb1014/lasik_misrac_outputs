  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and ensuring they do not access beyond object bounds. The provided OS_SetLocalTime_Impl implementation and the related symbol definitions contain no calls to any of these string.h functions, and there are no other string operations or uses of functions that copy/compare C-strings. The only pointer usage is &TimeSp passed to clock_settime (not a string function), and the inline helpers operate on OS_time_t values and integer arithmetic only. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
