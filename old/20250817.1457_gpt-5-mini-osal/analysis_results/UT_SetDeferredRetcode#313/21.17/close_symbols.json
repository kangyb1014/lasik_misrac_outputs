  "explanation": "To determine whether UT_SetDeferredRetcode can violate the MISRA C rule about out-of-bounds use of string.h functions, the analysis must follow how the pointer, size and destination are used by the code that actually performs memory operations. Reasons for each symbol:\n\n- UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue: This is the direct callee that receives the pointer-to-Retcode, the size (sizeof(Retcode)) and a count. Its implementation may call memcpy/memmove/memset or otherwise copy the supplied bytes into internal buffers; you must inspect it to see what copy functions are used and how the length and destination are computed/validated.\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry: UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue calls this (per the call graph). Its implementation determines which stub entry (destination) is returned and may allocate or compute pointers/lengths used by subsequent memory operations. You need its code to see how destination buffers are obtained and sized.\n\n- UT_StubEntry (the structure returned by UT_GetStubEntry, including its return-value buffer fields and sizes): To check bounds you must know the layout and declared sizes of the destination buffer(s) (e.g., return-value storage) into which Retcode bytes might be copied. The struct fields and any length fields control whether a memcpy could write beyond bounds.\n\n- UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: Functions that manage stub return storage often expose helpers to get a pointer to the return-value buffer; if UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue or UT_GetStubEntry use such helpers, their behavior (returned pointer, alignment, buffer size) is relevant to detect out-of-bounds copies.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t (typedef): The key type identifies which stub entry is targeted. The interpretation of this key inside UT_GetStubEntry/UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue can affect index/lookup logic that selects the destination buffer; incorrect handling could cause wrong buffer selection and out-of-bounds access.\n\n- UT_IntReturn_t (typedef): sizeof(Retcode) is passed to the configure function. The actual width/alignment of UT_IntReturn_t determines the number of bytes copied; you must know its exact size to determine whether the copy length matches the destination buffer capacity.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_INTEGER (enum/constant): The value-genre argument may control which branch or buffer is used inside UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue (e.g., integer vs pointer return storage). Its meaning is required to follow the code path and choose the correct buffer and copy semantics.\n\n- UtAssert_Failed: UT_SetDeferredRetcode calls this on invalid Count. While it is unlikely to perform string.h copies relevant to this rule, you should inspect its implementation to ensure its formatting/diagnostic path does not use risky string functions with the inputs from this function.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Called (directly or indirectly) by UtAssert_Failed and other assert helpers; its implementation may be involved in formatting diagnostics. Include it to make sure no string.h misuse arises from the assert path.\n\n- UtAssert_Abort: Called by UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue per the graph; it may be reached on error paths. Inspect to ensure its code does not use string.h functions insecurely with data from callers.\n\nIn summary, the essential items to inspect first are UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue, UT_GetStubEntry and the stub-entry structure/return buffer definitions (and the typedef for UT_IntReturn_t). The remaining symbols are included because they influence which buffer/branch is selected or represent error/reporting paths that could also employ string.h calls."
