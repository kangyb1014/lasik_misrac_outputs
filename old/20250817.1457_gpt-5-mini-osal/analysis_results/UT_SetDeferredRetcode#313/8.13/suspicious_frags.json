  "suspicious_frags": [
    "UT_ConfigureGenericStubReturnValue(FuncKey, &Retcode, sizeof(Retcode), UT_ValueGenre_INTEGER, Count, NULL);",
    "void UT_SetDeferredRetcode(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey, int32 Count, UT_IntReturn_t Retcode)"
  ],
  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains no other pointer usages that would be relevant to MISRA C Rule 8.13. The Count validation and UtAssert_Failed call do not involve taking or passing pointers that could/should be const-qualified. The sizeof(Retcode) expression and the NULL argument are not pointer-to-object values that indicate missing const qualification. Therefore only the function declaration (parameter Retcode) together with the call that takes its address need investigation to determine whether the pointer should point to a const-qualified type."
