  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const where appropriate or do not involve pointer types that could/should be const-qualified. Specifically:\n- The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, so the token pointer is already const-qualified.\n- The helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to take a const OS_object_token_t * (static inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)), so that API already enforces const-correctness for the token pointer.\n- The struct OS_impl_file_internal_record_t contains no pointer members (int fd; bool selectable;), so there are no internal pointer types to const-qualify.\n- The code writes to impl->fd (impl->fd = -1;), which requires a mutable pointer to the table element; thus making the pointer const would be inappropriate here.\n- Calls that do not produce or hold pointers (e.g., close(impl->fd)) are not relevant to Rule 8.13.\nGiven the above, only the listed fragments warrant further review to ensure pointers point to const-qualified types where possible (or to confirm why const is not appropriate)."
