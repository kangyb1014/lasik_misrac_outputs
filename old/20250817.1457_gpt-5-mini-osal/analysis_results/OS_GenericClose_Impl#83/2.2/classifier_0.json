  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_GenericClose_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_GenericClose_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int                             result;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);\n\n    result = close(impl->fd);\n    if (result < 0)\n    {\n        /*\n         * close() can technically fail for various reasons, but\n         * there isn't much recourse if this call fails.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The apparent logging call inside the if is a no-op because OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro, so there is no executed logging operation or call to strerror() in the built code. The only executed operation remaining is the evaluation of the condition (result < 0), which is used to gate the debug logging when OS_DEBUG is enabled; therefore the code is not \"dead\" under MISRA Rule 2.2. (If static analysis flags the empty if, consider removing the empty conditional or guarding the entire block with the debug macro to avoid an empty/unused check.)"
