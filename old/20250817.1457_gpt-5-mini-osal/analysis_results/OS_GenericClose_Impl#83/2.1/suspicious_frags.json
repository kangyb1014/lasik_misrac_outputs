  "explanation": "No code in OS_GenericClose_Impl is provably unreachable. Control flow executes sequentially: impl is obtained via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, close(impl->fd) is called, and both the if (result < 0) branch and the following impl->fd = -1; statement can be reached at runtime depending on the return value of close(). The OS_DEBUG macro expanding to nothing does not make the if block unreachable \u2014 it only makes the block empty after preprocessing, but the branch itself remains reachable. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET/OS_ObjectIndexFromToken usage does not introduce any compile-time-constant condition that would eliminate code paths. Therefore there are no fragments that must be investigated for unreachable-code violations under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
