  "explanation": "All other lines in the function do not call or use any of the string handling functions from <string.h> and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Specifically:\n- The call to close(impl->fd) and the assignment impl->fd = -1 do not perform any string operations or pointer-based string accesses.\n- The use of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the access to the impl structure (impl->fd) are simple object/table/index operations and do not involve functions from <string.h>.\n- The typedef and the external table declaration only define types and storage; they do not perform string accesses.\nThe only code that could involve <string.h> string handling is the OS_DEBUG call that invokes strerror(errno) and the OS_DEBUG macro itself (which may expand to logging code that uses string functions). Those fragments are therefore listed for investigation."
