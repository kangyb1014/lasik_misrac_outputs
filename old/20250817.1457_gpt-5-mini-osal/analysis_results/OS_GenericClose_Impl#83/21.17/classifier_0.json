  "scenario": "The code calls strerror(errno) and passes its return to OS_DEBUG as %s. strerror takes an int and returns a pointer to an internal null-terminated string (no caller-supplied pointer parameter is accessed), and OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro in the provided context. There is no use of string.h functions that access caller-supplied buffers (e.g. memcpy/strcpy/strcat/strlen on a provided pointer) that could read/write beyond object bounds. Therefore this fragment does not cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
