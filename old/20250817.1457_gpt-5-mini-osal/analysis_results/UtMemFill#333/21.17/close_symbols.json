  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required\n\n- typedef: uint32\n  - Needed to know the width and range of the loop index and Length parameter (e.g. 32\u2011bit unsigned). This affects comparisons, possible wrap/overflow semantics and whether Length can exceed the buffer size domain.\n\n- typedef: uint8\n  - Needed to know the storage size and effective type used for byte accesses. If uint8 is unsigned char, accesses via an unsigned\u2011char pointer are allowed by aliasing rules; if not, the effective access size/representation may differ.\n\n- All call\u2011sites of UtMemFill (each caller function name)\n  - The function itself has no information about the actual object Memory points to; to determine out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses you must inspect every place that calls UtMemFill.\n\n- For each call\u2011site: the buffer/object passed as Memory (array declaration or pointer)\n  - You must know the actual object (stack/static array, heap allocation, struct member) being written to in order to check that Length does not exceed that object\u2019s size.\n\n- For each call\u2011site: the expression used for Length (constant, variable, macro)\n  - The runtime value or upper bound of Length (and how it is computed) determines whether the loop i < Length can write past the buffer.\n\n- Definitions of any size/macros used to compute buffer size or Length (e.g. BUFFER_SIZE)\n  - Constants/macros used in callers or allocations determine compile\u2011time or run\u2011time limits to compare against Length.\n\n- Definitions/implementations of allocator functions used by callers (malloc, calloc, OSAL alloc wrappers)\n  - If Memory is obtained via dynamic allocation, the allocator\u2019s behavior and the size argument must be inspected to ensure the allocated size >= Length.\n\n- Any formal contract/comments/specification for UtMemFill (preconditions on Memory and Length)\n  - The function may rely on a caller contract (e.g. \u2018Memory points to at least Length bytes\u2019). If such a precondition exists, the MISRA analysis must verify callers satisfy it.\n\n- Platform characteristics: sizeof(char) and CHAR_BIT (platform headers)\n  - To relate bytes to uint8 and to ensure Length interpreted as number of bytes matches the object size units.\n\n- Definition of uint8 underlying type (is it unsigned char?)\n  - Confirms that indexing through Byte_ptr uses an unsigned char pointer (permitted aliasing) and that each index refers to one byte of storage.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine whether, for every call\u2011site and for all possible Length values, the loop Byte_ptr[i] = i writes only within the bounds of the object pointed to by Memory (the condition required by the MISRA rule about accesses beyond object bounds)."
