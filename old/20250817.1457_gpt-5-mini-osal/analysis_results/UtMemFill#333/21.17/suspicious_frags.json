  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 applies specifically to use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (for example memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The provided UtMemFill implementation contains no calls to any <string.h> functions \u2014 it performs a manual byte-wise fill via a uint8* pointer and a for loop. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that match the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and nothing to investigate for that rule.\n\nNote: although not relevant to Rule 21.17, the loop writes to memory via Byte_ptr[i] and could cause out-of-bounds writes if the caller passes a Length larger than the actual buffer size; that is a potential safety issue but is governed by other MISRA rules (bounds/aliasing/parameter validation), not Rule 21.17. No <string.h> usage is present."
