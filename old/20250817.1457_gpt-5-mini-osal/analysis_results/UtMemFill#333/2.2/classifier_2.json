  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMemFill:\n```c\nvoid UtMemFill(void *Memory, uint32 Length)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n    uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < Length; i++)\n    {\n        Byte_ptr[i] = i;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nvoid UtMemFill(void *Memory, uint32 Length)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n    uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < Length; i++)\n    {\n        Byte_ptr[i] = i;\n    }\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Each loop iteration stores a byte into the provided buffer (Byte_ptr[i] = i); removing those assignments would change program behaviour, so the code is not dead. (If UtMemFill were never called in the whole project that would be unreachable/unused code, but per Rule 2.2 note 2 unreachable code is not classified as dead code.)"
