  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMemFill:\n```c\nvoid UtMemFill(void *Memory, uint32 Length)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n    uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < Length; i++)\n    {\n        Byte_ptr[i] = i;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (i = 0; i < Length; i++)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The for-loop header controls a loop that writes Byte_ptr[i] = i; removing the loop would change program behaviour by omitting those writes (i.e. it is not dead code). The only non-violation caveat would be if Length were provably zero so the loop never executes (unreachable, not dead code per note 2) or in a very specific, provable situation where every write has no observable effect \u2014 neither of which is evident here."
