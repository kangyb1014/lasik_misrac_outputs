  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMemFill:\n```c\nvoid UtMemFill(void *Memory, uint32 Length)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n    uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < Length; i++)\n    {\n        Byte_ptr[i] = i;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nuint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The initialization \"uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\" is used in the subsequent loop (Byte_ptr[i] = i;). Removing the initialization would either make Byte_ptr an uninitialized pointer (introducing undefined behaviour) or require replacing uses \u2014 so the operation affects program behaviour and is not dead code. Note 3 of Rule 2.2 also states initialization is not a candidate for dead code."
