  "explanation": "To decide whether UtMemFill uses language extensions you must see any non\u2011standard typedefs, attributes, or build settings that could introduce extensions. Specifically:\n- The exact definitions of uint32 and uint8: these identifiers are not standard C type names (the standard names are uint32_t/uint8_t). Their typedefs or macros might themselves use compiler extensions or nonstandard widths, so you must inspect their definitions.\n- The header or source file where those typedefs are declared: that file shows whether standard headers (C99 <stdint.h>) are used or a project header that may employ extensions.\n- The declaration/prototype of UtMemFill (header) including any signature-wrapping macros: projects often use macros (FUNC, API, etc.) that expand to compiler-specific attributes or calling\u2011conventions; those can be language extensions.\n- Any attributes or macros applied to the function or the typedefs (e.g., __attribute__, __far, #pragma): these are explicit compiler extensions if present and must be examined.\n- Compiler vendor and version: what counts as an extension depends on the compiler; some constructs are standard in one compiler but treated as extensions in another, so you need the targeted compiler documentation.\n- Compiler/build flags and preprocessor defines: flags such as -std=c90 vs -std=c99 or switches enabling/disabling extensions (GNU/MS extensions) determine if a construct is an extension in the build environment.\n- Project/platform headers that change memory models or pointer qualifiers: embedded compilers add qualifiers (near/far) or language extensions via headers; those can change semantics and are relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\nProviding these symbols (typedefs, headers, attributes, compiler identity and build options) gives the next analyst the exact context needed to determine whether any nonstandard/implementation\u2011specific language extensions are used by the function."
