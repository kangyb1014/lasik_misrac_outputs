  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard C constructs: a void* parameter converted to an object pointer, pointer arithmetic/array indexing, a for loop, and ordinary integer and pointer types. There are no compiler-extension tokens or constructs present (for example: __attribute__, __declspec, __builtin_*, asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific keywords). The identifiers uint32 and uint8 are plain type names (their definitions are outside this fragment); their use here is a normal typedef usage, not a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
