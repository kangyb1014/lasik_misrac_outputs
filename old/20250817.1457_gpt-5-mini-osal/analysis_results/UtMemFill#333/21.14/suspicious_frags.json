  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided UtMemFill implementation contains no calls to memcmp or any other C standard library string/comparison functions (e.g. strcmp, strncmp, memcmp). It only performs a byte-wise fill: casts the void* Memory to uint8*, iterates over Length and assigns Byte_ptr[i] = i. There are no null-terminated strings, no string literals, and no comparisons of string data anywhere in the function. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
