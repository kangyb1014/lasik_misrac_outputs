  "explanation": "uint8 (typedef): UtMemFill casts the void* Memory to uint8*. To reason about byte-wise writes and whether they could be interpreted as characters (null-terminated strings) you must know what uint8 aliases (e.g. unsigned char) and its width/representation. uint32 (typedef): The loop counter i and the Length parameter use uint32; understanding their width and signedness is needed to reason about loop bounds and whether out-of-range indexing could lead to treating memory as a string. memcmp (function prototype): The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. To determine whether UtMemFill (directly or indirectly) violates that rule you must know if memcmp is called or aliased (direct call, macro, or through an indirect call) and the signature/semantics of memcmp to judge whether any comparisons in or reachable from this function are string comparisons using memcmp."
