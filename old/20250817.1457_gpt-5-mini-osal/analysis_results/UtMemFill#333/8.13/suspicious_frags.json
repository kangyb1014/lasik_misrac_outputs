  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function has a single pointer parameter (void *Memory) and a single derived pointer (uint8 *Byte_ptr). Both are intentionally non-const because the function writes to the pointed memory (Byte_ptr[i] = i). Making either pointer point to a const-qualified type would be incorrect for this write operation. There are no other pointer objects in the function that could reasonably be const-qualified, and the implicit conversion from void * to uint8 * is the expected usage here. Therefore no fragments are flagged for further investigation under Rule 8.13."
