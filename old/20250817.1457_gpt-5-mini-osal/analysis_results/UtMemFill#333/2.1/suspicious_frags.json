  "explanation": "No unreachable code constructs are present in the provided function. Specifically: \n- There are no unconditional return, goto, break, continue, or longjmp usages that would make subsequent statements unreachable. \n- There are no constant false/true conditional compilations (e.g. #if 0) or if (0) blocks that render code unreachable. \n- The for-loop body is conditionally executed (when Length > 0) but is not intrinsically unreachable; a zero Length means the loop is skipped at runtime, which is normal and not a violation of Rule 2.1. \n- All statements (variable declarations, the pointer assignment, and the loop) are potentially reachable depending on runtime inputs. \nTherefore, no fragments in this snippet require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
