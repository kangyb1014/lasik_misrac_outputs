Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required:\n\n- uint32 (typedef): The loop counter i and the Length parameter use uint32. The exact typedef reveals width and signedness (unsigned) which matters for reasoning about loop counter behaviour (wrap/overflow) and whether the increment in the third clause modifies only the loop counter in a defined way.\n\n- uint8 (typedef): The type pointed to by Byte_ptr determines the storage size written by the loop body. Also its declaration may include qualifiers (e.g. volatile), which would make the write a persistent side effect relevant to the MISRA clause that prohibits the second/third clause using objects modified in the loop body.\n\n- UtMemFill prototype/declaration (header) including parameter qualifiers/attributes: The function declaration in the header may add attributes (e.g. parameter qualifiers, restrict, compiler attributes, calibrated annotations) that change aliasing or side-effect reasoning. The precise prototype is needed to see any contract that affects whether objects named in the for-clauses can be modified by the body.\n\n- Memory parameter qualifiers/attributes (volatile, restrict, const, alignment, pointer provenance annotations): Whether Memory is qualified volatile or has a restrict/noalias attribute directly changes whether writes through Byte_ptr are considered persistent side effects or whether they may alias objects used in the loop clauses (Length or i). A restrict/noalias guarantee would prove the body cannot modify the counter or the Length object; volatile would make the body produce persistent side effects.\n\n- Caller contexts / call sites that pass the Memory argument (actual buffers): To determine if the store Byte_ptr[i] = i can modify any object used in the loop clauses (Length or i), you must know what buffers actual callers pass. If a caller passes a pointer that overlaps storage holding Length (unlikely but possible in whole-program analysis) or other objects used in the second/third clauses, MISRA\u2019s prohibition could be violated. Examining call sites provides real aliasing scenarios.\n\n- Pointer-aliasing / no-alias annotations or model used in this translation unit (e.g. compiler attributes, static analysis annotations, or project-specific contracts): The MISRA rule depends on whether objects used in the for clauses are modified by the loop body. That determination requires the project\u2019s aliasing rules/annotations or the compiler\u2019s pointer provenance model to conclude whether a write through Byte_ptr may alias i or Length or other objects used in the loop clauses.\n\n- Any functions called from the loop body (none in this function): The MISRA text includes the behaviour of any functions called within the loop body. Listing this symbol (and noting there are none) makes explicit that there are no called functions whose side effects must be considered. If a function were called, its prototype and side-effect summary would be required.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal additional information needed to decide if the for loop is well-formed under the cited MISRA constraints: in particular to (a) identify the single loop counter and its initialization/updates, (b) verify the second clause uses only permitted objects that are not modified by the body, and (c) verify the third clause modifies only the loop counter and not objects modified by the body."
