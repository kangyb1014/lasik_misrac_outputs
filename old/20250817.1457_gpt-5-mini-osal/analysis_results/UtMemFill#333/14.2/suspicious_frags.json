Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of the for statement (its three clauses and the single loop counter). The only parts of the provided code that fall under that rule are the for statement itself (all three clauses) and the operations performed in its body that could affect or depend on the loop counter. Other fragments in the function do not affect the for statement clauses and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 14.2: - The function signature and parameters (void UtMemFill(void *Memory, uint32 Length)) are not part of the for statement clauses. - The declarations (uint32 i; uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;) merely declare/initialize objects; the initialization of Byte_ptr from Memory is outside the for statement and does not change the loop-counter semantics. - The choice of types (uint32, uint8) and the pointer conversion from void* to uint8* are not elements of the for statement clauses and so are outside the scope of Rule 14.2. - There are no function calls inside the loop body whose side effects would need separate analysis for this rule. Therefore only the for header and the assignment inside the loop body need to be investigated with respect to Rule 14.2 (to ensure the second clause only uses allowed objects and the loop counter is not modified in the body, including indirectly)."
