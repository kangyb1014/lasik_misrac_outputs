  "explanation": "1) uint8: The typedef (or macro) that defines uint8 is required to know whether the pointed-to type is modifiable (e.g. it could be defined as 'const uint8' or another type alias). Determining whether Byte_ptr[i] = i modifies the object the parameter points to (allowed by MISRA) depends on the actual definition/qualifiers of uint8.\n\n2) uint32: The typedef that defines uint32 is required to confirm the signedness/width of Length and the loop variable i. This is needed to verify that Length (a function parameter) is not being modified inadvertently via implicit conversions or integer promotions in the loop control (the MISRA rule concerns modification of parameters \u2014 confirming Length is only read requires knowing its exact type).\n\n3) UtMemFill (declaration/prototype as seen in headers): The external declaration/prototype may include different qualifiers on the parameter (for example 'const void *Memory' or 'void * const Memory') or macro substitutions that change the parameter type. To decide if the function violates the rule you must know the authoritative parameter declaration (including const/volatile qualifiers) as used by the build. If the prototype declares the pointer parameter itself as const, that would affect whether the code modifies the parameter."
