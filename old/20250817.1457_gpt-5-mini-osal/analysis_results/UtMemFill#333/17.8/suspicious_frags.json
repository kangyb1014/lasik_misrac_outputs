  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the function does not modify any parameter objects themselves. The pointer parameter Memory is only copied into a local pointer (uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory) and that local pointer is used to write to the pointee via Byte_ptr[i] \u2014 modifying the object pointed to is permitted by the rule, while modifying the pointer parameter itself would not be. The scalar parameter Length is not assigned to or altered. There are no assignments to Memory or Length, no increments or reassignments of the parameter variables, so Rule 17.8 is not violated by any fragment in the provided code."
