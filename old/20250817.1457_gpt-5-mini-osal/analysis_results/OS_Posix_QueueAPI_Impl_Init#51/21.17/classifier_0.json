  "scenario": "The memset call is safe if OS_impl_queue_table is a statically sized array or points to an allocated object whose size is at least sizeof(OS_impl_queue_table). A violation would occur if OS_impl_queue_table is an invalid/uninitialized pointer or if it points to a buffer smaller than the number of bytes passed to memset (for example, if OS_impl_queue_table is a pointer that has not been allocated/initialized or points to a smaller allocation), in which case the memset would access beyond the object bounds."
