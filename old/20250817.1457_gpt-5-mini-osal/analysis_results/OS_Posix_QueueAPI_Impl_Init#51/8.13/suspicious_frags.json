  "explanation": "No code fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 were found. Reasoning: \n\n- There are no pointer variable declarations in the provided function or related symbol definitions \u2014 OS_impl_queue_table, POSIX_GlobalVars, and OS_BSP_Global are objects/arrays, not pointer-typed variables. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and their const-qualification.\n\n- The only place a pointer value is used implicitly is the call to memset(OS_impl_queue_table, ...). The array decays to a pointer for that call, but memset writes to the buffer intentionally, so a pointer-to-const would be inappropriate; therefore this usage does not violate the guidance to use const whenever possible.\n\n- Assignments to POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth and the use of the OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C cast operate on scalar/typedef types, not pointer types, so Rule 8.13 is not applicable.\n\n- No function parameters or other expressions involving pointer types that could/should be const-qualified are present in the provided code.\n\nGiven the above, there are no suspicious fragments to flag for further investigation under Rule 8.13."
