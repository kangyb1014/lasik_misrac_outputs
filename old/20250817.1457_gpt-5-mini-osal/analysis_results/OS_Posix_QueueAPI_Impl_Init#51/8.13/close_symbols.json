  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check MISRA C 'pointer should point to const whenever possible' for OS_Posix_QueueAPI_Impl_Init:\n\n- OS_impl_queue_table: The object passed to memset. Need its declaration/type (array vs pointer, element types, and whether any subobjects are const) to determine whether it is legal to pass a non-const pointer and whether any pointer-to-const issues arise.\n\n- memset: Prototype/signature is required to confirm the parameter types (first argument is void * not const void *) and therefore whether passing the address of OS_impl_queue_table violates the rule.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global structure containing TruncateQueueDepth. Need its declaration to see member types and const qualification on the member and/or on the global itself.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth: The specific member being written. Need its exact type (and whether it is a pointer type) and const-qualification to decide if assigning to it violates the rule or if its type should be a pointer-to-const.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: Declaration of the BSP-provided globals structure; required to examine MaxQueueDepth\u2019s type and constness.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth: The value assigned into TruncateQueueDepth under permissive mode. Need the type and const-qualification (is it an integer, pointer, or pointer-to-const?) to verify compatibility and pointer-const rules.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: Macro definition/expansion used in the non-permissive branch. This macro may perform casts or type conversions; its expansion can affect whether a pointer or non-const object is involved.\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE: Compile-time macro that controls which assignment path is compiled. The analysis must consider both possible compiled branches, so this symbol is needed to know which code is active or to reason about both.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: Return value macro/constant; include to ensure return type/usage does not involve pointer-to-const concerns (sanity check).\n\n- (type) of TruncateQueueDepth/MaxQueueDepth (e.g. OS_blockcount_t): The actual typedef used for these members (if present). Knowing the typedef is required to determine whether the members are integer types or pointer types and whether pointer const-qualification rules apply.\n\n(These symbols and their declarations/macros are the minimal set needed to determine whether any pointer is being used where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate in the shown function.)"
