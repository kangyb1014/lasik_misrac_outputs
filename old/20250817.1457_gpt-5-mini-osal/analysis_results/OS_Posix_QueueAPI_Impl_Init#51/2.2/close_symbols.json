  "explanation": "For deciding whether any statements inside OS_Posix_QueueAPI_Impl_Init are dead code (i.e., their removal would not affect program behaviour) the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_impl_queue_table\n  - Required to know the object\u2019s type, size, linkage and all other writers/readers. The memset zeroing could be redundant if the table is already initialized elsewhere or never used; you must see its uses and initial value to judge whether the memset is necessary.\n\n- memset\n  - Needed to confirm it has the intended side-effect (zeroing) in the target build and is not a no-op or replaced by something with different semantics; also to consider if compiler/linker optimizations could remove the call.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars\n  - To inspect the struct layout, initialization state and other accesses. Writing TruncateQueueDepth may be redundant if it is never read or always set elsewhere.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth (member)\n  - To find all reads and writes of this field across the codebase; if no observable read uses this assignment, it could be dead.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global\n  - To determine whether MaxQueueDepth comes from platform-specific configuration and whether assigning it changes behaviour.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth\n  - To know its default value and whether the assignment under the permissive build config actually changes program behaviour (or duplicates an existing value).\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE (compile-time macro)\n  - The presence/absence of this define controls which assignment is compiled. Dead-code analysis must consider the active build configuration(s) \u2014 the statement may be compiled out entirely depending on this macro.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C (macro)\n  - The macro expansion determines what value is actually assigned in the non-permissive case; the expansion may have side effects or be equivalent to a constant/initializer, affecting whether the assignment is meaningful.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS\n  - The return value is part of the function\u2019s observable behaviour; knowing whether callers inspect the return value (or ignore it) may affect whether the function can be removed or its body altered without changing behaviour.\n\n- OS_API_Impl_Init\n  - Static call graph shows this function calls the target. To determine reachability and therefore whether the target is dead, the analyzer must examine the caller and the caller\u2019s reachability.\n\n- OS_API_Init\n  - Shown as caller of OS_API_Impl_Init; needed to trace upward reachability from program entrypoints to decide if OS_Posix_QueueAPI_Impl_Init can ever be executed.\n\n- references/address-taken occurrences of OS_Posix_QueueAPI_Impl_Init\n  - Even if direct calls in the static call graph appear absent/limited, the function may be referenced through function-pointer tables or registration mechanisms. All places that take its address or store it in tables must be found to assess true reachability and whether removal would change behaviour.\n\nCollecting definitions, initializers and all cross-references for these symbols (including build/configuration variants) is necessary to conclude whether any operation inside the function is dead code under the MISRA rule."
