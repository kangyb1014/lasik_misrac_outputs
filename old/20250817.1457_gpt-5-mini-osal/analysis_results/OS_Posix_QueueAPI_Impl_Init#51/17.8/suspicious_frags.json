  "explanation": "The function OS_Posix_QueueAPI_Impl_Init has a void parameter list (no parameters), so there are no function parameters that could be modified in this function. The operations inside the function operate on global objects (memset on OS_impl_queue_table, assignments to POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth, and reads from OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth) and use macros and constants; these are not function parameters and therefore not subject to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Consequently, there are no code fragments in the provided function that need investigation for modification of function parameters."
