  "explanation": "memset \u2014 Confirm this is the standard library zeroing function (or a harmless wrapper). We must ensure it is not a macro or wrapper that hides a call to memcmp or other string-comparison logic.\\n\\nOS_impl_queue_table \u2014 The object being zeroed; knowing its type (array of bytes, array of structs, array of char* pointers, etc.) is necessary to determine whether any string comparisons might be implied by its usage or initializer macros. If it contains pointers to NUL-terminated strings, other code or macros might compare them elsewhere.\\n\\nPOSIX_GlobalVars \u2014 The structure/variable declaration is required to see the type and semantics of members and any accessor macros that could expand to calls (potentially to memcmp).\\n\\nPOSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth \u2014 The specific member assigned here; its type (integer, pointer, struct) determines whether the assignment could invoke conversion/comparison logic or hide function calls. Must confirm it is not a string or an expression that expands to memcmp.\\n\\nOS_BSP_Global \u2014 Declaration of this BSP-global container is needed to inspect MaxQueueDepth (see next). Ensure no macro wrappers call memcmp.\\n\\nOS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth \u2014 The value used when OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE is set. Inspect its definition: if it is a macro or function-like macro it could expand to code that uses memcmp or string comparisons.\\n\\nOSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C \u2014 This macro is used in the else branch. Its definition must be inspected to ensure it does not expand to any code that performs string comparisons or calls memcmp.\\n\\nOSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE \u2014 The compile-time flag controls which branch is compiled. Knowing whether it is defined (and how it is defined) is necessary to determine which symbols/macros to inspect and therefore whether any memcmp usage could be introduced in the compiled code.\\n\\nOS_SUCCESS \u2014 The return value constant; include to verify it is a plain integer constant and not a macro that hides other expressions or function calls.\\n\\nRationale: The MISRA rule forbids use of memcmp for comparing NUL-terminated strings. Although the shown function does not call memcmp directly, macros or definitions referenced here (memset, OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C, BSP globals, or other macros used in assignments/returns) could expand to or call memcmp or other string comparison routines. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to inspect definitions/macros/types to conclude definitively that no memcmp-based string comparison is introduced by this function or its expanded macros."
