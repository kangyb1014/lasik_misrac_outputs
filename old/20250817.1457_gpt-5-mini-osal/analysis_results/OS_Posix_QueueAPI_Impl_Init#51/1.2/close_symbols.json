  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions of any identifiers/macros referenced by the function because extensions may be hidden in those definitions. Reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- OS_impl_queue_table: The call to memset uses sizeof(OS_impl_queue_table). The declaration/definition could use a compiler extension (e.g. GCC flexible/packed attributes, anonymous structs/unions, or nonstandard types) that would violate the MISRA prohibition on language extensions.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global structure may be defined with compiler-specific attributes or nonstandard constructs. You must inspect its definition to ensure no extensions are used in the type itself.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth: The field's type and any initializer macros for it may use extensions (e.g. __attribute__, typeof, bit-field widths that rely on implementation behaviour). Check the field declaration/type to ensure standard C only.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: The BSP global object may be defined using compiler extensions; its definition must be checked.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth: The member's type (and any macros used in its initialization) could hide extensions; inspect this member specifically.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: This macro is used in the else branch. Macros often embed compiler-specific tokens or builtins (e.g. __extension__, statement expressions ({...}), typeof, asm). Its definition must be examined for extensions.\n\n- OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE: Although a preprocessor symbol, its definition or the build-time mechanism that sets it could imply use of compiler extensions or conditional compilation constructs; check how it is defined/used in headers/build system.\n\n- int32: This typedef defines the function return type. The typedef could be implemented via a nonstandard construct or rely on compiler-specific width assumptions; inspect its typedef to confirm it is a standard C typedef (e.g. based on stdint.h) and does not use extensions.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The returned macro/enum value may be defined using extension constructs (e.g. enum with nonstandard attributes or macros with statement expressions). Inspect its definition.\n\n- memset (prototype from <string.h>): While the standard library function itself is not a language extension, some projects provide wrapper macros or inline implementations that use compiler builtins or extensions. Confirm which memset is referenced (standard prototype or a project-specific macro) and inspect that definition if it is not the standard header symbol.\n\nOnly after examining these definitions can you be confident the target function does not rely on compiler-specific language extensions hidden behind typedefs, macros, struct/field declarations, or library wrappers."
