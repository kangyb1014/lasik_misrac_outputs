The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "memset \u2014 Identify whether this is a plain library call or a macro/inline that could expand to code containing for-loops or side effects. The MISRA check requires considering the behaviour of functions called inside loop bodies and whether they introduce or modify loop counters/flags.\n\nOS_impl_queue_table \u2014 The object being zeroed. Need its type and whether any of its accessors/macros expand to code with loops or side effects (e.g., if it is a complex macro or has custom zeroing wrapper).\n\nPOSIX_GlobalVars \u2014 The containing object for TruncateQueueDepth; need its definition to determine the type and storage class, and whether any assignment to its members is implemented via macros or inline functions that could contain loops or side effects.\n\nPOSIX_GlobalVars.TruncateQueueDepth \u2014 The specific member assigned. Must know its type (boolean, integral, volatile, bitfield, or accessor macro) to ensure the assignment does not modify other loop-control objects or hide loops/side effects that would affect a for-loop analysis.\n\nOS_BSP_Global \u2014 The object holding MaxQueueDepth; its definition is required to see whether MaxQueueDepth is a simple scalar or an accessor that may contain loops/side effects.\n\nOS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth \u2014 The value used when OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE is defined. Need its type/definition to ensure it is a plain value and not a macro/function that could alter loop-control objects.\n\nOSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C \u2014 Macro used in the else branch. Macros can expand to expressions or function calls; its definition is required to confirm it does not expand to code containing for-loops or modify loop-control objects.\n\nOSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE \u2014 Compile-time configuration that selects which branch is used. Its value determines whether the MaxQueueDepth path or the OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(0) path is compiled; need to know which code to analyze for possible for-loops or side effects.\n\nOS_SUCCESS \u2014 Return value symbol. Its definition is needed to confirm it is a plain constant and that returning it does not invoke any cleanup code or macros that could include loops or modify loop counters.\n\n(Notes: There are no explicit for-loops in the shown function. The items above are those whose definitions/macros could introduce for-loops or hidden side-effects affecting MISRA for-loop well-formedness when expanded or called.)"
