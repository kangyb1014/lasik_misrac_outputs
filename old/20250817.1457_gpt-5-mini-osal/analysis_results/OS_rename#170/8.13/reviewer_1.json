In OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext, 'record' is declared as 'OS_common_record_t *' and is assigned from OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(iter->base, iter->token). The function only reads fields from 'record' (e.g. record->active_id) and does not modify it, so both 'record' and the data pointed to by 'iter->base' could and should be const-qualified (for example: 'const OS_common_record_t *record' and 'const OS_common_record_t *base' in OS_object_iter_t). Using non-const pointers here violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_rename(const char *old, const char *new)\n{\n    OS_object_iter_t             iter;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    int32                        return_code;\n    char                         old_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    char                         new_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    FILE                        *logf = NULL;\n\n    /* Log inputs */\n    logf = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1363.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (logf != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(logf, \"OS_rename called: old=\\\"%s\\\", new=\\\"%s\\\"\\n\", old ?

  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the code shown. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends qualifying pointers to point to const-qualified types when possible, but that only applies when the pointee is not modified. In OS_rename the pointer obtained from OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is used to modify the stream record (strncpy(stream->stream_name, ...);), so the pointer must be a pointer-to-mutable data and cannot be const-qualified. The agent\u2019s observation about an internal function (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext) declaring a local record pointer as non-const even though it only reads fields is a separate implementation detail; if that function truly only reads from the record, its local variable could be made const, but that does not make OS_rename non\u2011compliant. Without inspecting the implementations and all call sites of the object table accessors, you cannot conclude a Rule 8.13 violation for OS_rename. Therefore the reported violation is incorrect."
