  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_rename code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_rename.\n```c\nint32 OS_rename(const char *old, const char *new)\n{\n    OS_object_iter_t             iter;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    int32                        return_code;\n    char                         old_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    char                         new_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(old, old_path);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_TranslatePath(new, new_path);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_FileRename_Impl(old_path, new_path);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, &iter);\n\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, iter.token);\n\n            if (stream->socket_domain == OS_SocketDomain_INVALID && strcmp(stream->stream_name, old) == 0)\n            {\n                strncpy(stream->stream_name, new, sizeof(stream->stream_name) - 1);\n                stream->stream_name[sizeof(stream->stream_name) - 1] = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The two assignments 'SysMountPointLen = 0;' and 'VirtPathBegin = VirtPathLen;' are executed but never affect program behaviour. If OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch fails the later code that would use these values is skipped (return_code != OS_SUCCESS). If OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch succeeds and the filesystem is valid, both variables are overwritten (SysMountPointLen and VirtPathBegin are set from filesys fields) before any use. Therefore removing these assignments would not change behaviour \u2014 they are dead code and violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1362.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n    fputc('\\n', f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_rename(const char *old, const char *new)\n{\n    OS_object_iter_t             iter;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    int32                        return_code;\n    char                         old_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    char                         new_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    /* Fixed the malformed/concatenated string literal here */\n    probe_log(\"OS_rename entry: old=%p, new=%p, called\", (const void *)old, (const void *)new);\n    if (old != NULL)\n    {\n        probe_log(\"OS_rename: old literal='%s'\", old);\n    }\n    if (new != NULL)\n    {\n        probe_log(\"OS_rename: new literal='%s'\", new);\n    }\n\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(old, old_path);\n    probe_log(\"OS_TranslatePath(old) returned %d\", (int)return_code);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        probe_log(\"OS_TranslatePath(old) -> '%s'\", old_path);\n        return_code = OS_TranslatePath(new, new_path);\n        probe_log(\"OS_TranslatePath(new) returned %d\", (int)return_code);\n        if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            probe_log(\"OS_TranslatePath(new) -> '%s'\", new_path);\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_FileRename_Impl(old_path, new_path);\n        probe_log(\"OS_FileRename_Impl('%s','%s') returned %d\", old_path, new_path, (int)return_code);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        probe_log(\"Starting object table iteration for active local objects\");\n        OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, &iter);\n\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            /* Log the iterator token value to help reproduce control flow */\n            probe_log(\"Iterator token: %llu\", (unsigned long long)iter.token);\n\n            stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, iter.token);\n            if (stream == NULL)\n            {\n                probe_log(\"Stream record for token %llu is NULL\", (unsigned long long)iter.token);\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            /* Log stream fields that affect the branching */\n            probe_log(\"Stream token=%llu: socket_domain=%d, stream_name='%s'\",\n                      (unsigned long long)iter.token,\n                      (int)stream->socket_domain,\n                      stream->stream_name);\n\n            if (stream->socket_domain == OS_SocketDomain_INVALID && strcmp(stream->stream_name, old) == 0)\n            {\n                probe_log(\"Match found (socket_domain invalid and name equals old).

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The OS_rename implementation shown does not contain the two assignments cited by agent A (SysMountPointLen = 0; and VirtPathBegin = VirtPathLen;). The violation scenario refers to variables and control flow that are not present in the provided OS_rename code, so the claim cannot be established against this function.\n\nMore generally, to prove a Rule 2.2 (dead code) violation you must show that the code in question is executed and that removing it would not change any observable program behaviour in any execution \u2014 including timing and interactions in an embedded system. Agent A\u2019s modified/test code did not compile, so it produces no runtime evidence. If the two assignments actually exist elsewhere, a whole-program or path-sensitive analysis (or a working test harness) is required to demonstrate they are truly removable without changing behaviour. As presented, the report is not supported by the supplied code or evidence."
