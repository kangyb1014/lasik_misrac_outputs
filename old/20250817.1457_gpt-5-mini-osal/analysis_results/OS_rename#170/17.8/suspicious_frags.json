  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the parameter variables 'old' or 'new'. Both are declared as const char * and are only used as inputs: passed to OS_TranslatePath(old, old_path) and OS_TranslatePath(new, new_path), used as the comparison key in strcmp(..., old), and used as the source argument in strncpy(..., new, ...). There are no assignments to 'old' or 'new', no pointer arithmetic on them, and no casts that remove const. OS_TranslatePath writes into local buffers old_path/new_path, and the only memory writes in the function target stream->stream_name (a table entry), not the objects pointed to by the parameters. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
