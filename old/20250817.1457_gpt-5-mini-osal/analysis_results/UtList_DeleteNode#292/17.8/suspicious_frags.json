  "explanation": "No fragments require investigation for Rule 17.8. The function parameter is a pointer (UtListNode_t *DeleteNode) and there are no assignments to the parameter variable itself (no statements like DeleteNode = ..., ++DeleteNode, or similar). The called helper UtList_Extract modifies members of the object pointed to (ExistingNode->Next, ExistingNode->Prev), which is permitted by the rule because the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified. The free(DeleteNode) call deallocates the object referred to by the pointer but does not modify the pointer parameter variable. Therefore, there is no evidence in the provided code that the pointer parameter itself is being modified, so no fragments are suspicious for Rule 17.8."
