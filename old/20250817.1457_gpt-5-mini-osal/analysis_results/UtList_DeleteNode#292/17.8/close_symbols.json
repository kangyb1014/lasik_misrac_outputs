  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: need the struct/typedef to know the type of DeleteNode and its member Data (is Data a pointer, integer, etc.). This distinguishes modifying the pointer parameter itself from modifying the object pointed to (modifying members is allowed by MISRA; assigning to the parameter variable is not).\n- UtList_Extract: need the prototype and/or implementation or macro definition. If UtList_Extract is a macro it could expand into code that assigns to the formal parameter identifier (or otherwise rebinds DeleteNode). If it is a function, its prototype/body will show whether it could modify the pointer parameter variable (e.g. if its declaration is actually taking a pointer-to-pointer) or has other side effects relevant to whether the parameter variable is modified.\n- NULL (macro/definition): need the definition/type of NULL in this translation unit to confirm that the comparison DeleteNode->Data != NULL is a pointer/null check (allowed) and not some other sentinel that could imply different semantics.\n- free (declaration/macro): need the declaration/macro for free in this build (headers/macros) to ensure free is the expected library function and not a macro that could, for example, reassign the DeleteNode identifier or otherwise alter the parameter variable within this TU.\nThese symbols are the ones that can affect whether the pointer parameter variable DeleteNode itself is modified (direct assignment or via macro expansion) versus only the object it points to (which is permitted by MISRA)."
