The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n- UtList_Extract (full function definition / body): The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of functions called from the statement as part of the loop body. Although UtList_DeleteNode contains no for-loop itself, UtList_Extract is called from it; if UtList_Extract contains any for-loops those must be checked for the three clauses and single loop-counter constraints. We need the full body to inspect any for statements, their loop counters, side effects, and calls inside them.\n\n- UtListNode_t (typedef / struct definition): The target function dereferences DeleteNode->Data and passes DeleteNode to free. The struct definition is needed to understand the types and semantics of members (e.g. whether Data is an array, a struct, a pointer to volatile/atomic object, or has custom accessors) which could affect whether objects used as loop counters are modified indirectly.\n\n- The type of UtListNode_t::Data (the declaration of the Data member): The NULL check and any potential indirect modification of objects used in loops depend on the exact type of Data (e.g. void*, pointer to a struct that may alias loop counters, or an integer used as a loop flag). Knowing the Data type helps determine whether DeleteNode->Data access or freeing DeleteNode can affect loop control objects.\n\n- Any global variables referenced/used inside UtList_Extract (list and definitions): If UtList_Extract accesses globals that are used as loop counters or loop-control flags (or modifies objects that are used by loops), those globals must be examined to ensure the for-loop clauses meet MISRA requirements. We need the names and definitions so the analyser can check for improper modifications or side effects.\n\n- Any macros or inline functions used inside UtList_Extract (definitions): Macros/inline functions may contain for-loops or side effects that influence loop correctness. Their expanded code must be inspected to verify clauses and single loop-counter constraints.\n\n- Any functions called by UtList_Extract (definitions): Per the call-graph this may be empty, but if UtList_Extract calls other functions, those callees' bodies become part of the loop behaviour and need the same for-loop inspection.\n\nNote: Standard library symbols like free() or NULL themselves do not introduce for-loops; they only need their prototypes if pointer types or semantics are unclear. The minimal essential artifacts to decide MISRA compliance are UtList_Extract's implementation plus the complete declarations/types for the node structure and any objects that function touches."
