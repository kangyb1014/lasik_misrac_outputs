  "explanation": "I found no uses of any <string.h> functions in the provided code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns calls to the standard string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The shown functions \u2014 UtList_DeleteNode, UtList_Extract, UtList_Reset, and UtList_Destroy \u2014 perform pointer manipulations and calls to free(), but do not call any of the listed string.h routines. Therefore there are no code fragments that could violate Rule 21.17 and nothing here needs to be investigated for that specific rule. (If you want, separate checks could be run for other MISRA rules such as pointer validity or use-after-free, but those are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
