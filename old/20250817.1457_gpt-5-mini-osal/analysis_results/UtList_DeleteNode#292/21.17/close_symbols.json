  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t (type/struct definition): needed to know the exact type of the Data member (char*, void*, fixed array, embedded buffer, etc.) and sizes/offsets of fields. The MISRA rule applies to operations on buffers; without the node layout you cannot determine whether any string.h calls indexed or copied beyond bounds.\n- UtList_Extract: this callee is invoked directly by UtList_DeleteNode. Its implementation must be inspected for any use of string.h functions (memcpy/memmove/memset/str*/*) operating on the node or on Data that could access out-of-bounds memory.\n- UtList_Reset: caller of UtList_DeleteNode. Its code may pass nodes created or populated in a way that affects whether later string operations are safe (e.g., it may call routines that copy into node Data). Understanding callers helps determine the life-time and typical contents/size of Data.\n- UtList_Destroy: caller of UtList_Reset (in the call chain). It may orchestrate bulk operations (allocations, copies, or clears) on nodes/Data using string.h functions; inspect it for any string.h usage that could run beyond object bounds.\n- Functions that allocate or populate UtListNode->Data (e.g. UtList_CreateNode, UtList_Insert, UtList_Add): any routine that allocates or writes into the Data buffer (including uses of memcpy/strcpy/strncpy/memset, etc.) is directly relevant to the MISRA rule because they establish the buffer sizes and perform the potentially problematic operations. If these functions are present elsewhere in the list module, they must be examined to determine whether string.h calls access memory beyond the referenced objects.\n\nIn short, to determine if UtList_DeleteNode (or its reachable code) violates the string.h bounds rule you must know the node layout and inspect all functions that create, populate, extract, reset, or destroy nodes for uses of string.h functions and for the sizes/allocations of Data buffers."
