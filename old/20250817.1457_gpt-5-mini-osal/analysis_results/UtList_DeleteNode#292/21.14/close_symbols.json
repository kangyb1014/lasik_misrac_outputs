  "explanation": "- UtList_Extract (implementation): UtList_DeleteNode calls UtList_Extract before freeing. To decide whether the MISRA rule is violated we must inspect UtList_Extract for any use of memcmp to compare strings (for example comparing DeleteNode->Data or other node fields). The static call graph shows UtList_Extract is the only callee, so its body is the primary place a forbidden memcmp-for-strings could appear.\n- UtListNode_t (struct/typedef definition): The type and declaration of DeleteNode->Data are needed to determine whether the Data member is a pointer to a null-terminated string (char * / const char *) or some other data. The MISRA rule only forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings \u2014 knowing the Data type and intended semantics is essential to decide if any memcmp use is comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n- Any inline/static helper functions or macros used by UtList_Extract: If UtList_Extract uses inline functions, static helpers, or macros, those bodies may perform memcmp-based string comparisons. They must be inspected because they are effectively part of the reachable code from the target function even if they do not appear in the coarse call graph.\n- memcmp (any occurrences reachable from UtList_Extract): Explicit occurrences/usages of the standard memcmp symbol in the translation unit(s) reachable from UtList_Extract must be identified and examined to see whether they are being used to compare null-terminated strings (which would violate the rule) or to compare binary buffers (which is allowed)."
