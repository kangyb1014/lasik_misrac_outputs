  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14 concerns use of the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. A review of the provided code (UtList_DeleteNode and UtList_Extract) and the related symbols shows no invocation of memcmp or any other string comparison functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp) and no inclusion of <string.h>. The functions only manipulate list pointers and call free(), which are unrelated to Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation for this rule."
