  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: The full struct/typedef is required to know the exact types of members (especially Data) and whether members are intended to be mutable. MISRA-C const qualification depends on the pointed-to type: e.g., if Data is a pointer to data that is never modified, it should be const-qualified. Also knowing which fields are modified (or must be modifiable) determines whether the node pointer itself could be a pointer-to-const.  \n- UtList_Extract: This callee is invoked with DeleteNode; its prototype/implementation is needed to determine whether it modifies the node or the list links. If UtList_Extract writes into the node or list pointers, DeleteNode cannot be const. If it only reads, DeleteNode could possibly be a pointer-to-const.  \n- UtList_Reset and UtList_Destroy: These callers (and their implementations) show how UtList_DeleteNode is used across the code base. If callers pass mutable nodes or rely on modification after delete, that affects whether the parameter should be const. They also indicate ownership/usage patterns relevant to const qualification.  \n- Node allocation/initialization functions (e.g., UtList_CreateNode/UtList_Add): The functions that create or set UtListNode_t and its Data member are needed to see whether Data is treated as mutable or immutable, and to understand ownership/ownership-transfer semantics. That information affects whether pointers to the node or to Data could/should be const-qualified under MISRA.  \nThese symbols together let an analyst determine which pointers and pointee types are actually modified (thus cannot be const) and which could be const-qualified to satisfy MISRA C rule."
