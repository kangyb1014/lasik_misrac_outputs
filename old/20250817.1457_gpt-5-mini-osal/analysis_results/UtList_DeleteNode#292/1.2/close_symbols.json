  "explanation": "UtListNode_t: The definition (typedef/struct) is required to check for language extensions used in the type itself or its members (e.g., anonymous structs/unions, flexible-array members, compiler-specific bit-field widths or non\u2011standard attributes). The code accesses DeleteNode->Data, so the Data member's type/definition must be inspected for extensions.\n\nUtList_Extract: The function declaration/definition is required to verify it does not use any compiler-specific extensions in its prototype or body (e.g., nested functions, nonstandard calling conventions, GCC/clang __attribute__ annotations, asm labels, or other extensions) that would affect whether the target function (which calls it) relies on extensions.\n\nfree: The prototype (normally from <stdlib.h>) must be checked to ensure it is the standard C declaration and not a compiler-specific replacement or macro using extensions (attributes, nonstandard signatures). Also to confirm the call site is standard C usage.\n\nNULL: The macro/definition of NULL must be checked because some nonstandard definitions (e.g., compiler-specific pointer literal extensions) could be considered language extensions; the comparison DeleteNode->Data != NULL should be validated against the canonical definition."
