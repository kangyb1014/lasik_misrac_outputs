  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/Microsoft extension keywords or tokens such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, __asm/__asm__, asm volatile, __declspec, __cdecl, __stdcall, __interrupt, or similar.\n- There are no statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, no inline assembly, no inline nested functions, and no use of compiler-specific pragma variants.\n- The code uses standard C constructs (structs, pointers, void*, function calls, free). The identifier uint32 appears to be a user typedef (not a compiler extension) and its use does not imply a language extension.\n- Pointer manipulations and member accesses in UtList_Extract and the conditional/free in UtList_DeleteNode are standard C operations.\n\nGiven these checks, there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
