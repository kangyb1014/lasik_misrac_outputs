  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the free(DeleteNode) call is executed conditionally when DeleteNode->Data != NULL, so the code is reachable when that condition can be true. This only violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 if program invariants guarantee DeleteNode->Data is always NULL at this point (for example, if UtList_Extract always sets DeleteNode->Data = NULL or callers only pass nodes with Data == NULL), in which case the conditional body would be unreachable."
