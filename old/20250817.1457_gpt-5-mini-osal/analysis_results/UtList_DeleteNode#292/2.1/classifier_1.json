  "scenario": "Not violated: the call to UtList_Extract(DeleteNode) is reachable and does not by itself create unreachable code. The subsequent if and free are reachable provided UtList_Extract returns normally. Rule 2.1 would only be violated if UtList_Extract is guaranteed never to return (for example it always calls exit(), does a longjmp that bypasses the caller, or contains an infinite loop), which is not evident from the fragment."
