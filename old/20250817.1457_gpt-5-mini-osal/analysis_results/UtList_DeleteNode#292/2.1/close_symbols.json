  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t (structure/type definition): The function tests DeleteNode->Data. To decide whether the if-branch can ever be entered you must know the exact layout and semantics of the Data member (type, default/initializer values, whether it is an alias to some constant, etc.).\n- UtList_Extract (full implementation): This callee executes before the if-check. If UtList_Extract modifies DeleteNode (e.g. clears Data), frees it, longjmps, exits, or otherwise prevents execution from reaching the following code, that would make the subsequent code unreachable. The full implementation is required to determine those effects.\n- UtList_Reset (full implementation and call sites): UtList_Reset is the direct caller of UtList_DeleteNode. The call context (which node(s) it passes) may guarantee a particular DeleteNode->Data value (always NULL or always non-NULL) or never call the function at all in some builds. You need its body and call sites to decide reachability of branches inside UtList_DeleteNode.\n- UtList_Destroy (full implementation and call sites): UtList_Destroy calls UtList_Reset (transitive caller). Its usage/context may further constrain which nodes are passed down, or include conditional compilation paths that make parts of the call chain unreachable. To prove unreachable code in the project you must inspect all transitive callers.\n- Node allocation/initialization routines that set UtListNode_t.Data: Any functions or static initializers that create or initialize list nodes may establish invariants about the Data member (e.g. header nodes always have Data==NULL). Those invariants are necessary to prove that a branch is never taken across all possible inputs.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and all call sites) lets you determine whether any statement or branch in UtList_DeleteNode can never be executed (MISRA: unreachable code)."
