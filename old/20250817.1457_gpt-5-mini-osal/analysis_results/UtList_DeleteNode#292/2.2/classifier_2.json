  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_DeleteNode:\n```c\nvoid UtList_DeleteNode(UtListNode_t *DeleteNode)\n{\n    UtList_Extract(DeleteNode);\n\n    /* non-data/header nodes shouldn't be free()'ed */\n    if (DeleteNode->Data != NULL)\n    {\n        free(DeleteNode);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nUtList_Extract(DeleteNode);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The call to UtList_Extract(DeleteNode) removes the node from the list (updates next/prev pointers or list head/tail). Its execution changes program state; removing it would leave the node linked into the list (causing dangling pointers, incorrect traversal, or other behavioral changes). Therefore the call is not dead code."
