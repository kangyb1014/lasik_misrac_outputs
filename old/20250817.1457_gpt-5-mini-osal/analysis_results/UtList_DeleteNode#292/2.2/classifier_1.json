Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_DeleteNode:\n```c\nvoid UtList_DeleteNode(UtListNode_t *DeleteNode)\n{\n    UtList_Extract(DeleteNode);\n\n    /* non-data/header nodes shouldn't be free()'ed */\n    if (DeleteNode->Data != NULL)\n    {\n        free(DeleteNode);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nDeleteNode->Data != NULL\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general. The expression \"DeleteNode->Data != NULL\" is a runtime test and is not dead code unless there is a guaranteed invariant that makes the test always true or always false at this call site. A concrete violation scenario would be: if, by design or by earlier calls (e.g. node construction and UtList_Extract), every DeleteNode passed here always has Data != NULL (or always has Data == NULL), then the conditional and its branch are executed but redundant \u2014 removing the test would not change program behaviour, so that instance would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Absent evidence of such an invariant, the fragment does not itself violate the rule."
