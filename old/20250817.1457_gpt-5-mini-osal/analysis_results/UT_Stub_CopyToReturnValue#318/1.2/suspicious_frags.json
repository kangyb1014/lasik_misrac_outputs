  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided function body. The code consists of standard C constructs (function definition, pointer parameters, conditional statements, struct member access, calls to memcpy and a project assertion function, and use of NULL and size_t). There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions or keywords (for example: __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, inline-asm, pragma directives, or other vendor-specific keywords) in the shown fragments.\n\nThe remaining symbols that might look nonstandard (UT_EntryKey_t, UT_StubTableEntry_t, cpuaddr, uint32, UT_EntryData_t) are typedefs or project-defined types shown only by name; a typedef name itself is not a language extension. Without documentation showing that identifiers such as cpuaddr or uint32 are actually compiler-provided, undocumented built-ins or language extensions, they cannot be flagged under MISRA C Rule 1.2. Therefore no fragments are reported for further investigation."
