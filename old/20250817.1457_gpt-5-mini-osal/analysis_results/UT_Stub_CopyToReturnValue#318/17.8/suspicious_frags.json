  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code fragment. Evidence:\n- FuncKey is only used as an argument to UT_GetStubEntry and is never assigned to or altered in the function body.\n- BufferPtr is declared as const void * and is only read (passed to memcpy); the pointer itself is not assigned or changed.\n- BufferSize is only read (compared and used as an argument to memcpy and assigned to a struct field) and is not assigned to or altered.\n- The only write operations are to memory referred to by StubPtr (memcpy to StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr and StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position = BufferSize), which is permitted: the object pointed to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but no pointer parameter variable is modified here.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
