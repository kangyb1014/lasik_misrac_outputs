  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameters/variables in this function are:\n- BufferPtr (declared const void *): already const-qualified and used only as memcpy source (read-only). Compliant.\n- StubPtr (declared UT_StubTableEntry_t *): used to modify the return-buffer contents (memcpy into StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr and assignment to StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position). Because the function writes through this pointer, it cannot be const-qualified here. The memcpy destination (StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr) must be a non-const pointer by nature of being written to.\n\nGiven the visible code and the usage patterns, there are no places where a pointer could reasonably be const-qualified but is not. If the definitions of UT_GetStubEntry or the structure types (UT_StubTableEntry_t, Buff.BasePtr, etc.) were different than implied (for example, if BasePtr were declared const despite being written to), that would be a separate issue, but nothing in the shown fragment violates Rule 8.13."
