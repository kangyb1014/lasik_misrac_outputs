  "explanation": "Other pointer-related fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: \n- The call to OS_ObjectIdGetById(\"return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR, var_id, &token);\") passes &token as an output parameter that the callee fills; that pointer cannot reasonably be const-qualified.\n- The local declaration \"OS_object_token_t token;\" is not a pointer type and therefore not relevant to the rule.\n- The variable \"return_code\" and the parameter \"var_id\" are not pointer types and are not applicable to Rule 8.13.\n- The control flow (the if-check on return_code and the return statement) do not involve pointers that could be const-qualified.\n\nThe only place in this fragment where a pointer to a non-const object is passed where the callee likely only needs read access is the call to OS_CondVarLock_Impl(&token); that call should be inspected to determine whether the parameter could be declared as pointer-to-const to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
