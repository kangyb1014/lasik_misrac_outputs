  "explanation": "No language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The function uses only standard C constructs: typedefs (int32 mapped to int32_t, osal_id_t to uint32), macros for constants (OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR, OS_SUCCESS), standard comments, local variable declarations, and normal function calls/returns. There are no compiler-specific keywords or attributes (for example no __attribute__, __declspec, __inline__ or asm), no GCC/Clang extensions such as statement-expressions ({...}) or typeof, no inline assembly, no designated initializers, no variadic macros, no C++ features, and no other constructs typically documented as compiler extensions. The forward declaration typedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t and use of integer typedefs from <stdint.h> are standard C. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
