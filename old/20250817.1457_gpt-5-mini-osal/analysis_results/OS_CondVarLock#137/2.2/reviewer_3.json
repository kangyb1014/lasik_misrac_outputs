  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_CondVarLock code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_CondVarLock.\n```c\nint32 OS_CondVarLock(osal_id_t var_id)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n    int32             return_code;\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR, var_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_CondVarLock_Impl(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The assignment 'ReturnPtr = NULL;' at the start of UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr is dead code. In the error path the function calls UtAssert_Abort (which does not return), and in the normal path ReturnPtr is always overwritten with StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr before any use or return. Removing the initial 'ReturnPtr = NULL;' would not change program behaviour, so this executed assignment constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_CondVarLock_Log(const char *stage, osal_id_t var_id, int32 return_code, const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1098.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Print stage, var_id, return_code and the token pointer address. Casts to long/unsigned long used\n         * to avoid format-type mismatches for project-specific typedefs. Token contents are not dereferenced. */\n        fprintf(f, \"OS_CondVarLock: %s | var_id=%lu | return_code=%ld | token_ptr=%p\\n\",\n                stage,\n                (unsigned long) var_id,\n                (long) return_code,\n                (const void *) token);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nint32 OS_CondVarLock(osal_id_t var_id)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n    int32             return_code;\n\n    /* Log entry with provided var_id */\n    OS_CondVarLock_Log(\"entry\", var_id, 0, NULL);\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR, var_id, &token);\n\n    /* Log result of ObjectIdGetById and token address */\n    OS_CondVarLock_Log(\"after_ObjectIdGetById\", var_id, return_code, &token);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* About to call implementation - record state */\n        OS_CondVarLock_Log(\"before_Impl\", var_id, return_code, &token);\n\n        return_code = OS_CondVarLock_Impl(&token);\n\n        /* Record return from implementation */\n        OS_CondVarLock_Log(\"after_Impl\", var_id, return_code, &token);\n    }\n\n    /* Log final return code and exit */\n    OS_CondVarLock_Log(\"exit\", var_id, return_code, &token);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_CondVarLock.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the supplied OS_CondVarLock code. The OS_CondVarLock implementation shown contains no assignment like 'ReturnPtr = NULL;' and no obvious executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so the function as given does not violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2. Agent A's scenario describes a different function (UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr) and an assignment inside that function; that may or may not be dead code, but it is unrelated to the OS_CondVarLock snippet provided. The supplied logging test produced no evidence of dead code in OS_CondVarLock. To establish a true Rule 2.2 violation for UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr one would need the actual implementation of that function (and confirmation that the assignment is executed on all paths and never affects behavior)."
