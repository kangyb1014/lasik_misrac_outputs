  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment. The expression invokes a function via Conv.timer_callback_func (a function pointer). MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 addresses pointers to object types that should point to const-qualified types when possible. Function types cannot be const-qualified, so calling a function through a function pointer does not violate 8.13. (Note: a related concern could exist elsewhere \u2014 e.g. if Conv.opaque_arg is declared as void * but the pointed-to data is never modified, that member should be const void * \u2014 but that is outside the shown fragment.)"
