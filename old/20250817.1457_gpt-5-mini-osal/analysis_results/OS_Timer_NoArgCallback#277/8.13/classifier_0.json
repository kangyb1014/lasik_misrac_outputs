  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The function parameter is declared as void *arg and Conv.opaque_arg is assigned from it. If the pointed-to object is not intended to be modified by the timer callback (i.e. it is read-only context data), then both the parameter and the wrapper member should be const void * (or otherwise const-qualified). Because the code uses non-const pointers where const could be applied, this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
