  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. In the shown function 'arg' is not modified and is only stored and forwarded via Conv.opaque_arg; therefore it can (and per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 should) be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const void *arg and a matching const void *opaque_arg in OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t). As written, the non-const void * allows modification semantics that are not used and so contradicts the rule. If the API cannot be changed for compatibility reasons, a documented justification (deviation) is required; otherwise the correct fix is to make the parameter and the wrapper field const-qualified and propagate that change through any callers/users. Note: the provided test code failed to compile because the wrapper type and other context were not supplied, not because the rule is inapplicable."
