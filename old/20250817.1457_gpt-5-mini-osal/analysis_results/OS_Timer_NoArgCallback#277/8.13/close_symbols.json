  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to assess the MISRA rule about const-qualified pointers:\n\n- OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t: the wrapper structure defines the two critical members (opaque_arg and timer_callback_func). You must see the exact declarations to know whether opaque_arg is declared as void * or const void * and whether the wrapper forces/masks constness.\n\n- timer_callback_func typedef (member type): the function-pointer typedef stored in the wrapper shows the parameter/return types and whether the callback prototype requires or assumes constness of any pointed-to data. This influences whether the pointer stored in opaque_arg can/should be const-qualified.\n\n- OS_SimpleCallback_t (if present): the source comment references this typedef. Its definition will show whether the authors intended a function-pointer type that takes a pointer or not, and whether casting between void * and that function-pointer type would hide const qualifiers.\n\n- Timer creation/setup APIs / call sites that populate and pass the wrapper as arg: you must inspect the code that constructs the wrapper and the origins of the pointer passed in as 'arg'. If those call sites pass a pointer-to-const (const void *) or later mutate the pointed data, that determines whether the wrapper and this callback can/should use const-qualified pointers.\n\n- Prototypes/definitions of functions assigned to timer_callback_func: some callbacks may access or modify the object referred to by opaque_arg (directly or via global state). Knowing what those callbacks do is necessary to decide whether the pointed-to object must be mutable (so opaque_arg cannot be const) or could be const-qualified.\n\n- Definition/typedef of osal_id_t: while not a pointer, its typedef confirms the callback signature and helps ensure no indirect pointer-to-const issues are hidden by aliases.\n\n- Declaration of opaque_arg member type (if separate): if opaque_arg's type is a typedef (or otherwise declared elsewhere), you need its exact declaration to determine const qualification.\n\nIn short: to decide if void *arg (and the wrapper's opaque_arg) should be const-qualified you must see the wrapper/type definitions and every site that creates, populates or consumes that pointer (including the callback functions). These symbols let you determine whether the pointed-to object is ever mutated and therefore whether const qualification is possible without breaking the rest of the code."
