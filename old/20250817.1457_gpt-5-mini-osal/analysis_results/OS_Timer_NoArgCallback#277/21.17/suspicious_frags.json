  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) and requires they not access beyond object bounds. The provided function contains no calls to any of these string.h functions, no buffer copies, no array indexing or pointer arithmetic that would imply string/buffer manipulation, and no inclusion or use of <string.h> is shown. The only operations are assigning a void* into a wrapper field and invoking a function pointer; those do not involve string handling and therefore are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (although they may be relevant to other MISRA rules). Consequently there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.17."
