  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement assigns a void* (arg) to Conv.opaque_arg, which is standard C if opaque_arg is a data pointer (void*). This does not use any compiler language extension. (If opaque_arg were a function pointer or this performed an implicit conversion between data and function pointers, that would rely on compiler extensions and would violate Rule 1.2, but nothing in the fragment indicates such an extension.)"
