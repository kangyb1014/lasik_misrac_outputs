  "explanation": "The function parameters are objid (osal_id_t) and arg (void *). There is no assignment to either parameter variable anywhere in the function body: Conv.opaque_arg = arg copies the value of arg into a local union member (it does not modify the parameter itself), and the call (*Conv.timer_callback_func)(objid) passes objid by value to the callback without modifying the parameter. No pointer arithmetic or reassignment is performed on arg or objid. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to modify a function parameter and thus none that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
