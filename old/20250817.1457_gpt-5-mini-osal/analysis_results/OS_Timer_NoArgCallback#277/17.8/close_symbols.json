  "explanation": "OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t: The struct definition (or typedef) is required to know the declared types of its members. Whether Conv.opaque_arg is a void* or some other type determines if the assignment Conv.opaque_arg = arg copies the pointer value (allowed) or performs some other operation that might modify the parameter. OS_SimpleCallback_t: The comment references this callback type and the code invokes Conv.timer_callback_func; knowing the exact function-pointer typedef lets you determine whether timer_callback_func is storing/reading pointer values or performing casts that could alter the parameter. osal_id_t: The type of objid must be known to confirm it is passed by value (so calling the callback with objid can't be construed as modifying a pointer parameter). timer_callback_func (member type of OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t): Explicitly knowing the member's type (signature) is needed to see whether the call through this pointer could modify the pointer parameter 'arg' (for example, if the callback expects a different semantic or performs pointer writes). opaque_arg (member type of OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t): Knowing this member's type (void* vs function pointer vs other) is necessary to decide whether assigning arg to it constitutes modifying the pointer parameter itself or merely copying its value into another object. Together these symbols let you determine whether the code changes the parameter variables (arg or objid) themselves or only the object they point to, which is needed to assess compliance with the MISRA rule."
