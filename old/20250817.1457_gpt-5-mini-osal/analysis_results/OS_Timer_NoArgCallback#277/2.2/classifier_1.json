Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Timer_NoArgCallback:\n```c\nstatic void OS_Timer_NoArgCallback(osal_id_t objid, void *arg)\n{\n    OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t Conv;\n\n    /*\n     * Note - did not write this as simply *((OS_SimpleCallback_t)arg) because\n     * technically you cannot cast a void * to a function pointer.\n     */\n    Conv.opaque_arg = arg;\n    (*Conv.timer_callback_func)(objid);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Timer_NoArgCallback:\ntypedef union\n{\n    OS_TimerCallback_t timer_callback_func;\n    void *             opaque_arg;\n} OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t\n...\ntypedef uint32 osal_id_t\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic void OS_Timer_NoArgCallback(osal_id_t objid, void *arg)\n{\n    OS_Timer_ArgWrapper_t Conv;\n\n    /*\n     * Note - did not write this as simply *((OS_SimpleCallback_t)arg) because\n     * technically you cannot cast a void * to a function pointer.\n     */\n    Conv.opaque_arg = arg;\n    (*Conv.timer_callback_func)(objid);\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment Conv.opaque_arg = arg stores the pointer bytes into the union so that Conv.timer_callback_func can be invoked; removing that assignment would change program behaviour, so it is not dead code."
