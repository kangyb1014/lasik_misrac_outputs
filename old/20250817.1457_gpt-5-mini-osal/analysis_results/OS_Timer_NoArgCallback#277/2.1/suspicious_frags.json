  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. The body contains a single union variable, an assignment to the union member opaque_arg, and a single indirect function call; there are no conditional branches, no returns before other statements, no labels/goto constructs that skip code, and no infinite loops that make subsequent statements unreachable. The commented-out alternative cast is not present as executable code. Although the union-based reinterpreting of a void* as a function pointer is potentially problematic for other MISRA rules (type-punning and converting between data and function pointers), it is not an instance of unreachable code and therefore does not need to be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. If desired, separate analysis can be performed for rules concerning pointer conversions, undefined behavior, or unused/static functions, but those are outside the scope of Rule 2.1."
