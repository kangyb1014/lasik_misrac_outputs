  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp or any other string/comparison library calls are present in the provided code fragment. The function OS_Timer_NoArgCallback only performs a void* to function-pointer conversion via an intermediate wrapper and invokes the callback; there are no uses of char arrays, null-terminated strings, or string-comparison operations that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Therefore, there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.14 in this code."
