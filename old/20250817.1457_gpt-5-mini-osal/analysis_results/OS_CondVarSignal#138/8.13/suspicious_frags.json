  "suspicious_frags": [
    "return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR, var_id, &token);",

  ],
  "explanation": "The MISRA rule targets pointer usage and whether pointers should point to const-qualified types. In this function there are no pointer variable declarations; only address-of expressions are used when passing &token to other functions. Non-pointer objects such as var_id and return_code are not relevant to this rule. Therefore the only locations that could violate Rule 8.13 in this snippet are the two calls that pass the address of 'token' to external functions; other lines do not involve pointers and need not be investigated here."
