Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. If the pointed-to buffer is intended to be read-only (or there is no need for callers to modify the buffer via the returned pointer), DataBuffer should be declared as pointer to const, e.g. const void **DataBuffer (or const void * *), so the function returns a pointer-to-const. Declaring it as void ** allows modification through the returned pointer and therefore violates the rule in that scenario.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void UT_LogDataBufferInfo(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey,\n                                void **DataBuffer,\n                                size_t *MaxSize,\n                                size_t *Position,\n                                void *ResultDataBuffer,\n                                size_t ResultMaxSize,\n                                size_t ResultPosition,\n                                int stub_found)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2443.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"UT_GetDataBuffer invoked.

  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 encourages use of const-qualified pointee types where possible, but it is context dependent. In UT_GetDataBuffer the parameter DataBuffer is an output parameter that receives (is assigned) a pointer value via *DataBuffer = ResultDataBuffer. The function is therefore intentionally modifying the caller's pointer object (the variable of type void * in the caller). Declaring DataBuffer as pointer-to-const (e.g. const void ** ) would change the semantics and prevent the function from writing the caller's pointer without casts; it is not a safe drop-in replacement and is not \u201cpossible\u201d in this context without altering the API. Consequently the current declaration (void **) is appropriate for an output pointer-to-pointer parameter, and the reported violation of Rule 8.13 is not justified here.\n\n(If the intention were instead to return a pointer to data that must not be modified by the caller, the correct change would be to make the returned pointer type const void * (and adjust the API accordingly) \u2014 but that is a semantic/API change, not a simple const qualification that the rule mandates.)"
