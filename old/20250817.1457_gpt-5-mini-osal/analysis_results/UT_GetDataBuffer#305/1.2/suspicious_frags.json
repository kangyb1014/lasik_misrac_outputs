  "explanation": "The remainder of the UT_GetDataBuffer implementation uses only standard C constructs (function definition, pointers, assignments, conditional statements) and standard library types such as size_t and void *. There are no uses of compiler-specific keywords or extensions in the function body (no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions, zero-length arrays, named address-space qualifiers, GCC/MSVC-specific pragmas, or other compiler-only language extensions). The call to UT_GetStubEntry and the pointer/member accesses are ordinary function and struct usages and do not by themselves indicate use of language extensions. Therefore those parts do not need investigation for Rule 1.2."
