  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C 'for loop shall be well-formed' analysis of UT_GetDataBuffer:\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry\n  - The function called by UT_GetDataBuffer. Even though UT_GetDataBuffer contains no for loop itself, MISRA requires considering the behaviour of any functions called within a for-loop body. To be safe and complete we must inspect UT_GetStubEntry for side effects (modifying objects that could be used as loop counters or flags, volatile accesses, or hidden state changes) and to see whether it contains or invokes any for loops that could affect callers.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t\n  - The return type of UT_GetStubEntry. Needed to understand whether accessing the returned pointer or its members may have side effects (for example, if members are volatile, or accessed through accessor macros/functions), and to determine the types of the members used in UT_GetDataBuffer.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t::Data\n  - The Data member is used to reach the Buff sub-structure. We need its definition to know types and qualifiers (volatile, const) that affect whether accessing these objects could violate the MISRA for-loop constraints or introduce hidden side effects.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t::Data.Buff\n  - The Buff sub-structure contains the specific fields read by UT_GetDataBuffer. Its definition (layout and qualifiers) is required to determine if the field accesses are simple reads or have side effects (volatile, property getters, bitfields, etc.).\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t::Data.Buff.BasePtr\n  - The BasePtr field supplies the ResultDataBuffer value. Knowing its type (void*, possibly qualified) is necessary to reason whether it can be used as a loop counter or be modified elsewhere in a way that would affect a for-loop\u2019s well-formedness.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t::Data.Buff.TotalSize\n  - The TotalSize field supplies ResultMaxSize (size_t). Its type and qualifiers are required to determine whether it can legally appear in the second or third clause of a for loop (e.g., whether it is modified outside the loop body or is volatile).\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t::Data.Buff.Position\n  - The Position field supplies ResultPosition (size_t). Same rationale as TotalSize: must know its type/qualifiers and whether accesses are side-effect free.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t\n  - The key type passed to UT_GetStubEntry. Its definition may reveal if passing it by value has side effects (unlikely) or whether it aliases with other objects that could be loop counters; include it for completeness when checking for unintended modifications.\n\n- UT_ENTRYTYPE_DATA_BUFFER\n  - The constant/enum passed to UT_GetStubEntry. Its value is needed to understand how UT_GetStubEntry behaves for this entry type (which may change what UT_GetStubEntry returns or what side effects it performs).\n\n- size_t\n  - The type used for MaxSize and Position. To determine whether these objects could be valid loop counters, and to check typical MISRA expectations about integer loop counters, the definition/standard semantics of size_t are required.\n\n- NULL\n  - The macro used in pointer comparisons. To reason about pointer tests and potential aliasing or side effects from comparing to NULL, the definition/semantics of NULL should be known (mainly for completeness).\n\nNote: UT_GetDataBuffer itself contains no for loops. The above symbols are the minimal set required to (1) confirm that the function has no internally ill-formed for loops, and (2) inspect the called function UT_GetStubEntry and the accessed data structures for side effects or qualifiers (volatile, accessor macros) that could affect the well-formedness of any for loops if UT_GetDataBuffer were used in a loop context or if UT_GetStubEntry is used inside a for-loop body elsewhere."
