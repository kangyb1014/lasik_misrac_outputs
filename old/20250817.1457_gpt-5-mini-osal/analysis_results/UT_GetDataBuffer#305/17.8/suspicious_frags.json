  "explanation": "No pointer parameter is being reassigned in this function. The parameters are: FuncKey (not a pointer), DataBuffer (void **), MaxSize (size_t *), and Position (size_t *). The code only checks these pointer parameters for NULL and then dereferences them to store values (*DataBuffer = ResultDataBuffer; *MaxSize = ResultMaxSize; *Position = ResultPosition;). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8, modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted, whereas modifying the pointer parameter itself (e.g., DataBuffer = ..., MaxSize = ..., Position = ...) is not. There are no assignments to the parameter variables themselves, and all other assignments are to local variables (StubPtr, ResultDataBuffer, ResultMaxSize, ResultPosition). Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for violation of Rule 17.8."
