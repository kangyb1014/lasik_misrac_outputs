  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function OS_Application_Startup has no parameters (void), and there are no local variables that could be function parameters being modified. The body only invokes other functions (UtTest_EarlyInit, UT_BSP_Setup, UtAssert_BeginTest with a string literal, UtTest_Setup, UtAssert_EndTest) and performs no assignments to any parameter. Passing the string literal \"SETUP\" does not constitute modifying a function parameter in this scope. Therefore there are no code locations here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
