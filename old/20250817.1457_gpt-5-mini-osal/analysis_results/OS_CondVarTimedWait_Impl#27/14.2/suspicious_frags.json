  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the implementation of OS_CondVarTimedWait_Impl and all related definitions provided (inline helpers, macros, type definitions, and small helper functions). There are no for statements in the target function nor in the shown helper functions/macros (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array index expression; OS_TimeGetTotalSeconds/OS_TimeGetNanosecondsPart are simple arithmetic; pthread_cleanup_push/pop are macro invocations but their typical implementations do not introduce for loops). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for loops; since no for loops are present in the supplied code fragments, there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for this rule. If there are other files or macro expansions (e.g. a nonstandard definition of pthread_cleanup_push/pop) not shown here that might expand into a for loop, those expansions would need to be provided for review\u2014but based on the provided code, nothing to investigate."
