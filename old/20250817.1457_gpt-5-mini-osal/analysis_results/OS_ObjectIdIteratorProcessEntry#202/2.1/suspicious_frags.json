  "explanation": "The function body contains only a straight-line sequence of statements with no conditionals, labels, gotos, or multiple return points that would create statically unreachable code elsewhere. There are no declarations or code after the final return, and no compile-time constructs (e.g., #if 0, unreachable case labels) present in the snippet. The only potential for statements to become non-executable arises from the runtime behavior of the called functions (e.g., if the called handler does not return), so the listed statements are the only ones requiring investigation for possible unreachable execution at runtime. No other fragments in this function appear to be statically unreachable and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1."
