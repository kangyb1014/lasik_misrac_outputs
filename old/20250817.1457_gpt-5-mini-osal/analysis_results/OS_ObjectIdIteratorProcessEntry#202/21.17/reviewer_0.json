  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry.\n```c\nint32 OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry(OS_object_iter_t *iter, int32 (*func)(osal_id_t, void *))\n{\n    int32 status;\n\n    /*\n     * This needs to temporarily unlock the global,\n     * call the handler function, then re-lock.\n     */\n    OS_Unlock_Global(&iter->token);\n    status = func(OS_ObjectIdFromToken(&iter->token), iter->arg);\n    OS_Lock_Global(&iter->token);\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The call strcmp(stream->stream_name, Filename) can read past the bounds of either operand if either string is not NUL-terminated (or if either pointer is invalid). In the shown code only Filename is checked for NULL (OS_CHECK_POINTER) but there is no explicit guarantee in the fragment that stream->stream_name is a valid, NUL-terminated character array of sufficient length. If a stream table entry is uninitialized, corrupted, or its stream_name buffer was completely filled without a terminating '\\0', strcmp will continue reading memory beyond the object bounds to find a terminator \u2014 violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. A safe remediation is to use a bounded comparison (e.g. strncmp with the known buffer size) or otherwise ensure stream->stream_name is always NUL-terminated before calling strcmp.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_make_log_dir_if_needed(void)\n{\n    /* attempt to create the directory; ignore errors if it already exists */\n    (void)mkdir(\"/tmp/logs\", 0755);\n}\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    probe_make_log_dir_if_needed();\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1623.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (fp == NULL)\n    {\n        return; /* best-effort logging; do not alter program control flow on failure */\n    }\n\n    /* timestamp */\n    time_t t = time(NULL);\n    struct tm tm_buf;\n    (void)localtime_r(&t, &tm_buf);\n    char timestr[32];\n    if (strftime(timestr, sizeof(timestr), \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", &tm_buf) == 0)\n    {\n        timestr[0] = '\\0';\n    }\n\n    fprintf(fp, \"%s pid=%d \", timestr, (int)getpid());\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(fp, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(fp, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(fp);\n}\n\nint32 OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry(OS_object_iter_t *iter, int32 (*func)(osal_id_t, void *))\n{\n    int32 status;\n\n    /* Log entry and pointer state prior to unlocking.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct for the provided OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry code. The claimed violation concerns the use of string.h functions (e.g. strcmp) potentially reading past object bounds, but the target function contains no calls to any <string.h> functions. It only calls OS_Unlock_Global, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, the caller-supplied func, and OS_Lock_Global. Any unsafe use of strcmp (or other string.h routines) would be inside the handler pointed to by func or elsewhere (e.g. a separate stream lookup routine) \u2014 that would be a separate location to inspect, but it is not a violation attributable to this wrapper function itself. The provided test/logging code likewise does not invoke <string.h> functions (it uses stdio/time functions and strftime), so it cannot demonstrate a Rule 21.17 violation in this function. Therefore the report is incorrect for the shown code."
