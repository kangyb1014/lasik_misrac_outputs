  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The following constructs were checked and are not MISRA Rule 1.2 violations (or are standard language/library features, not compiler extensions):\n\n- Use of typedefs (int32, osal_id_t, OS_object_iter_t) \u2014 these are plain C typedefs, not extensions.\n- Function pointer parameter int32 (*func)(osal_id_t, void *) \u2014 standard C syntax.\n- static inline OS_ObjectIdFromToken(...) \u2014 the inline keyword is standard since C99 and is not a compiler extension by itself.\n- Use of pthread APIs (pthread_mutex_lock/unlock, pthread_cond_broadcast) and strerror \u2014 these are POSIX library calls, not language/compiler extensions.\n- Bitwise/constant expressions (0xFF000000, masking, shifts, casts to unsigned long) and format specifiers (%u, %lx) \u2014 standard C usage.\n- Macros like OS_DEBUG are not shown to use nonstandard extensions; their usage here is normal and no __attribute__ or GCC-specific tokens are present in the provided code.\n\nNo occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions were found (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (nonstandard form), typeof, statement expressions, GCC/Clang-specific builtins, or other vendor-specific keywords). Therefore there are no code fragments to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 in the supplied snippets."
