  "explanation": "No code fragments in the function modify the parameter TestCounters itself or the object it points to. Reasoning by code region:\n\n- Function signature: TestCounters is declared as const UtAssert_TestCounter_t * \u2014 the pointed-to object is const in this scope, preventing writes through this pointer in well-formed code.\n- Conditional checks (TestCounters->TestSegmentCount, TestCounters->CaseCount[\u2026]): these are read-only dereferences of the pointer \u2014 reading members does not modify the pointer or the pointed-to object.\n- UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport(\"SUMMARY\", TestCounters): passing the pointer to another function is permitted; it does not modify the local parameter variable in this function. There is no assignment to TestCounters before or after the call.\n- snprintf uses a converted value (unsigned int)TestCounters->TestSegmentCount \u2014 this is a read-only access and a value cast, not a modification of the pointer or its referent.\n- No pointer arithmetic, no assignment to TestCounters (no \"TestCounters = ...\"), no increments/decrements of the pointer, and no casts that remove constness are present in this function.\n- Other calls (OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, OS_BSP_SetExitCode, UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock) do not use TestCounters and therefore cannot modify the parameter in this function.\n\nGiven the above, there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (no modification of a function parameter)."
