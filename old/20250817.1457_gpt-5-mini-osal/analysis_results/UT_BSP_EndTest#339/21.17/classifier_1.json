  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: snprintf(Message, sizeof(Message), ...) guarantees NUL-termination for the buffer (sizeof(Message) == 128 > 0), so strlen(Message) will only access bytes within Message and not read beyond its bounds. A specific violation scenario would be if Message were not NUL-terminated (for example if Message were filled by a function that does not guarantee termination when truncated, such as strncpy used without manual termination, or if the buffer size passed to snprintf were zero or incorrect). In that case, strlen(Message) could read past the end of the array and violate Rule 21.17."
