  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not call or pass pointers to the string-handling functions from <string.h> and therefore are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Specifically:\n- The conditional on TestCounters->TestSegmentCount and the call to UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport only inspect counters and call other test-reporting functions (no <string.h> usage).\n- UT_BSP_Lock() and UT_BSP_Unlock() are synchronization primitives and do not perform string operations.\n- The exit-code logic (checks of TestCounters->CaseCount[...] and calls to OS_BSP_SetExitCode()) only manipulate integer values and call OS control functions, with no string.h calls or pointer-based string accesses.\n- There are no other calls to memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn (or other standard <string.h> functions) besides the fragment(s) reported above.\nTherefore the listed fragments are the only parts that need investigation with regard to Rule 21.17."
