  "explanation": "The rest of the code uses only standard C constructs (standard function declaration and return, pointer and const usage, simple assignments, local variable declarations, and the int32 typedef based on int32_t), and there are no visible uses of known compiler-specific language extensions (for example: __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, inline assembly, GCC statement-expression '({ ... })', or compiler-specific pragmas) outside the fragments listed above. The flagged fragments are places where macros or platform typedefs are used and could hide compiler-specific extensions in their definitions or expansions; those locations therefore should be inspected further. All other lines in the provided snippets do not exhibit indications of language extensions and so do not require further investigation for Rule 1.2."
