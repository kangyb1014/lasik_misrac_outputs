  "explanation": "Other fragments in the provided code do not modify the function parameter itself and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Specifically: the mutex/condition operations (OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex(&sem->id), pthread_cond_broadcast(&(sem->cv)), pthread_mutex_unlock(&(sem->id))) only operate on the semaphore object, not the function parameter variable; the increment ++sem->flush_request modifies a field of the semaphore record (an object derived from the token), which is permitted because the rule allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter; the declaration of the semaphore table (OS_impl_bin_sem_table) and the record type definition only define storage and members and do not modify the function parameter. These lines therefore do not constitute potential violations of Rule 17.8 and need not be investigated further."
