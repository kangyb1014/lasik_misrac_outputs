  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are definitely unreachable. Reasoning:\n- The function's control flow is straightforward: it obtains the semaphore record, attempts to acquire the mutex, returns immediately on failure, otherwise increments the flush counter, broadcasts the condition variable, unlocks the mutex, and returns success. Each statement is reachable depending on runtime conditions (successful or failed mutex acquisition).\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expansion (with the call-site passing *token) yields &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))], which is equivalent to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token)]. This expansion does not introduce any unconditional return or dead branch that would render subsequent code unreachable.\n- The helper OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex can return either success or failure; both outcomes are handled (success proceeds, failure returns), so no code after the failure return is unreachable in general.\n- There are no unconditional returns preceding live code, no #if 0 blocks, nor constructs that would statically make any of the statements unreachable.\nTherefore, based on the provided code and related definitions, there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If there are other project files or preprocessor conditional variants not shown here, those should be checked separately for unreachable code introduced by macros or conditional compilation."
