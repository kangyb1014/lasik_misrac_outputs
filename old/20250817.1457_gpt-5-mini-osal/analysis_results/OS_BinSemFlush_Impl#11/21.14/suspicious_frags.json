  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp or any byte-wise comparison of null-terminated strings are present in the provided code fragments. The function OS_BinSemFlush_Impl performs mutex acquisition, increments a flush counter, signals a condition variable, and unlocks the mutex. The related symbols and macros shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_impl_bin_sem_table, and OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex) do not use memcmp or string-comparison logic \u2014 OS_ObjectIndexFromToken returns an index from the token, the table macro uses that index to take an address, and OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex calls clock_gettime and pthread_mutex_timedlock. Therefore there are no code locations here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings). If there are other source files or macros not shown that use memcmp against strings, those would need to be inspected, but nothing in the provided snippets requires investigation for this rule."
