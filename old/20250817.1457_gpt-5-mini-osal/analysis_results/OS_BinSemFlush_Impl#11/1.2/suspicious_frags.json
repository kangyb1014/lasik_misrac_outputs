  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no compiler-extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, __extension__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), GCC nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- The use of static inline for OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is a standard C inline function (C99 and later). If a particular compiler documents inline as an extension for a given language mode, that would need to be checked against that compiler\u2019s documentation, but nothing in the source itself is an explicit compiler extension token.\n- POSIX APIs and types used (pthread_mutex_t, pthread_cond_t, pthread_mutex_timedlock, clock_gettime, struct timespec) are library/OS interfaces, not compiler language extensions, so they do not trigger Rule 1.2 per the instruction to report only compiler-documented language extensions.\n- The macros (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) and use of address-of and array indexing are standard preprocessor and C language features.\n- volatile sig_atomic_t and typedef\u2019d integer types (int32, osal_index_t) are standard C types/usage (or typedefs), not compiler language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that match the requirement to report explicit compiler language extensions."
