  "explanation": "No use of any string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in the provided code fragments. The OS_BinSemFlush_Impl function only uses pthread mutex/condition APIs and increments a sig_atomic_t field; OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex uses clock_gettime and pthread_mutex_timedlock. The shown types and table definitions do not perform any string operations or buffer copies. There are no calls or macros shown that pass object pointers or indices into any of the listed string-handling functions, so Rule 21.17 (out-of-bounds accesses via string.h) is not applicable to the provided code. If additional code (e.g., the implementation of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET or other modules) contained string.h calls, those should be re-examined, but nothing in the supplied fragments requires investigation for Rule 21.17."
