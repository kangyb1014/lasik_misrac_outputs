  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified: dir_id is passed by value (not a pointer), return_code is an integer (not a pointer), the declaration OS_object_token_t token; is an object instance (not a pointer type), the return statement and comment lines are not relevant. The only pointer usages in this code snippet are the two calls that pass &token, which have been reported for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
