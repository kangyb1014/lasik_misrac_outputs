In that situation the call return_code = OS_DirRewind_Impl(&token); violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because a non-const pointer is used where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate. If, however, OS_DirRewind_Impl is declared to take const OS_object_token_t * or the function legitimately modifies the token, then there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1219.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list args;\n    va_start(args, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, args);\n    va_end(args);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_DirectoryRewind(osal_id_t dir_id)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n    int32             return_code;\n\n    /* Log entry point.

  "explanation": "The agent's conditional reasoning is correct but the report as stated is not proven by the snippet. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 encourages pointer types to be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. Whether there is a violation cannot be determined from the caller alone: if OS_DirRewind_Impl is declared as taking a non-const OS_object_token_t * but its implementation does not modify the token, then that declaration (and thus the overall codebase) would violate Rule 8.13 and the agent\u2019s scenario is valid. If OS_DirRewind_Impl is declared to take const OS_object_token_t * or legitimately modifies the token, there is no violation. The provided OS_DirectoryRewind code by itself does not prove a violation. To resolve this, inspect the prototype and implementation of OS_DirRewind_Impl and, if it does not mutate the token, change the parameter to const OS_object_token_t *."
