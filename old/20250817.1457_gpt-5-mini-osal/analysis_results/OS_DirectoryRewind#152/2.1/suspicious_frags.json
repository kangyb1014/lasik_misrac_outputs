  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- All statements in OS_DirectoryRewind are reachable from function entry: the call to OS_ObjectIdGetById is executed unconditionally, the conditional block (if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)) and its assignment to return_code are both potentially reachable depending on the result, and the final return return_code is always executed. \n- There are no unconditional returns or jumps before subsequent statements, no constant false conditionals (e.g. if (0)), no #if 0 sections, and no dead labels/blocks in the snippet.\n- Declarations of local variables at the top are not considered unreachable code.\n\nCaveat: If OS_ObjectIdGetById or OS_DirRewind_Impl are implemented via macros or functions that never return (e.g., annotated noreturn or contain infinite loops), that could make code after their invocation effectively unreachable. Detecting that requires inspecting their definitions/implementations, which lie outside this function. Based solely on the code shown, there is no unreachable code to investigate."
