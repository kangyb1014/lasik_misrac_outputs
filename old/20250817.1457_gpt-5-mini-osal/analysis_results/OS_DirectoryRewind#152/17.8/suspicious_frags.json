  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The sole parameter, dir_id, is only passed by value to OS_ObjectIdGetById and never assigned to or altered. The local variable token is passed by address to OS_ObjectIdGetById and OS_DirRewind_Impl; modifying the object pointed-to is allowed by Rule 17.8 (the prohibition is on modifying the pointer parameter itself). There are no assignments to the parameter dir_id nor any other parameter-like variables in this function, so there are no fragments here that warrant investigation for Rule 17.8."
