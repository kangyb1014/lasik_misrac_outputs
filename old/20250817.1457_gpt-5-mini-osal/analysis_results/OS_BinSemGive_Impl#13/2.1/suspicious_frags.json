  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments found in the provided code with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Rationale:\n\n- Control flow: The only early exit is the conditional return when OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex(...) != OS_SUCCESS. That return is reachable at runtime (mutex acquisition can fail) and is legitimate; the remaining statements (setting current_value, pthread_cond_signal, pthread_mutex_unlock, and return OS_SUCCESS) are reachable when the mutex acquisition succeeds.\n\n- No statements follow an unconditional return within the same block, and there are no constant-true/false conditions, infinite loops, or labels/jumps that would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- Macro expansion (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_bin_sem_table, *token)) yields &OS_impl_bin_sem_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))], which is effectively &OS_impl_bin_sem_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token)]. This is a valid index expression; the array OS_impl_bin_sem_table is defined, and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is a simple inline accessor, so there is no compile-time unreachable code introduced by the macro.\n\n- The helper function OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex performs runtime operations (clock_gettime, pthread_mutex_timedlock) that can fail \u2014 these are runtime conditions and do not constitute unreachable code.\n\nBecause all code paths in the snippet are potentially reachable and there are no dead-code constructs, there are no fragments to flag for investigation under Rule 2.1."
