  "explanation": "No calls to memcmp (or to other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) appear in the provided function. The function operates on an OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t pointer and integer field current_value, and uses OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex, pthread_cond_signal, and pthread_mutex_unlock \u2014 none of which are string comparisons. There are no char* or null-terminated string variables in this fragment, and no macros or expressions in the shown code that perform memory comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition on using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
