  "explanation": "I examined the provided code for use of compiler-specific language extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin__ forms, statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, inline assembler, non-standard storage-class specifiers, or other constructs documented as compiler extensions). None of those appear in the code. The code uses POSIX APIs (pthread_mutex_t, pthread_cond_t, pthread_mutex_timedlock, clock_gettime) which are library/OS interfaces, not compiler language extensions. The macros and typedefs shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, typedef int32 = int32_t, volatile sig_atomic_t fields, etc.) are standard C usage and not compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments to flag under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
