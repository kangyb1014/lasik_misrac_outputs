  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. All pointer usages in the provided code are either already const-qualified where appropriate or must remain non-const because the pointed-to objects are modified: \n- The function parameter is declared const (const OS_object_token_t *token). \n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already accepts a const OS_object_token_t * and is used via the macro. \n- The local sem pointer refers to an element of OS_impl_bin_sem_table that is modified (sem->current_value, pthread_cond_signal on sem->cv, mutex operations on sem->id), so it must be a pointer to a non-const record. \n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex takes a pthread_mutex_t * which is used to lock/unlock the mutex and therefore cannot point to const. \n- pthread_cond_signal and pthread_mutex_unlock require non-const pointers to their objects. \n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro merely forms an address-of a table element and passes the token address to a function expecting a const pointer; there is no loss of const qualification at any call site shown. \nGiven these facts, there are no locations in the supplied code where a pointer could reasonably be changed to point to a const-qualified type without preventing required modifications."
