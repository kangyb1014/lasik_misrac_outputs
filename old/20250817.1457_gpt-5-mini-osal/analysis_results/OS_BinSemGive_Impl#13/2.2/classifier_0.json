Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BinSemGive_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_BinSemGive_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem;\n\n    sem = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_bin_sem_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n     * Note there is a possibility that another thread is concurrently taking this sem,\n     * and has just checked the current_value but not yet inside the cond_wait call.\n     *\n     * To address this possibility - the lock must be taken here.
