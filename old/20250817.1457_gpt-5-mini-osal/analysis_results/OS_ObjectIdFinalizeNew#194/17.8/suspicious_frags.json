  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is modified in this function. Details:\n- operation_status is only read and returned; it is not assigned to anywhere.\n- token (the pointer parameter) is never reassigned (no statements like token = ...). Accesses are reads of token->obj_id and token is passed to other functions by value; modifying the object pointed to by token (the pointee) would be allowed under Rule 17.8, and no pointer reassignment occurs here.\n- outid (the pointer parameter) is not reassigned; only the object it points to is written via *outid = final_id, which is permitted (the pointer itself is not modified). \n- final_id is a local variable; passing &final_id to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish does not modify any of this function\u2019s parameters.\nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
