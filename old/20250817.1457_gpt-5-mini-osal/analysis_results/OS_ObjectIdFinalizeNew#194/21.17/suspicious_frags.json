  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> string-handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided function, so there are no fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 to investigate.\n\nRelevant code items and why they need not be investigated for Rule 21.17:\n- final_id = token->obj_id; and final_id = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED; \u2014 simple scalar assignments, not string/buffer operations.\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, &final_id); and OS_NotifyEvent(...); \u2014 function calls, but none invoke or imply use of the <string.h> functions named in the rule within this fragment.\n- if (outid != NULL) { *outid = final_id; } \u2014 pointer is checked for NULL before a scalar write; this is not a string/buffer copy and thus not subject to Rule 21.17.\n\nNote: Although token is dereferenced without an explicit NULL check (token->obj_id and token passed to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish), this is a general pointer-safety concern but is not related to Rule 21.17 (which specifically targets use of <string.h> functions that could access beyond object bounds). Therefore no code fragments in this function require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
