  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. I inspected the following constructs and found them to be standard C: the function signature and return type, typedef-based aliases (int32, osal_id_t), pointer usage, control flow (if/else), function calls, and the macro OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED defined as ((osal_id_t){0}). The ((osal_id_t){0}) form is a C99 compound literal (standard C), not a vendor-specific extension. There are no GCC/Clang-specific extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __typeof__, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, or other nonstandard tokens) or other known compiler-specific constructs in the snippet. If your target compiler documentation explicitly lists any of these constructs (for example, compound literals) as an extension for the selected language mode, then that particular construct should be investigated; absent such documentation, nothing here meets the criterion of an explicit compiler extension."
