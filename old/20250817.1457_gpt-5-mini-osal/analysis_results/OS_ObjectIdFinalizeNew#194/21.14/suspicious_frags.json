  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library function memcmp appear in the provided target function or the related code fragments. All comparisons in the code are numeric/enum/pointer checks (e.g. operation_status == OS_SUCCESS, token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, final_id != NULL, record->refcount > 0, token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER, etc.). There are no string operations or buffer comparisons shown, and OS_DEBUG/OS_NotifyEvent calls use formatting/callbacks rather than memcmp. Therefore, within the supplied code there are no instances that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Note: external functions referenced but not defined here (for example OS_ObjectIdIsValid, OS_TaskGetId_Impl, or any EventHandler implementation) were not provided; if those external implementations exist in the codebase they should be checked separately for any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings."
