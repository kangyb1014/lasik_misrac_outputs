  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning:\n\n- token (OS_object_token_t *token): The token pointer is passed to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish and that function modifies the token (token->lock_mode is assigned). Because the pointed-to object is modified, the pointer must be non-const and does not need const-qualification.\n\n- outid (osal_id_t *outid): outid is an output parameter that the function writes to (*outid = final_id). Since the pointed-to object is intentionally modified, it must remain non-const.\n\n- final_id (osal_id_t final_id and &final_id): final_id is a local scalar, and the address is passed to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish which already declares the parameter as const osal_id_t *. The callee therefore already enforces const-correctness for the pointed-to value; no change is required here.\n\n- Other pointer usages (e.g., the NULL passed to OS_NotifyEvent) are not candidates for adding const qualification.\n\nGiven the above, there are no places in the provided code where a pointer could or should be changed to point to a const-qualified type without breaking intended behavior or existing const usage in the callee."
