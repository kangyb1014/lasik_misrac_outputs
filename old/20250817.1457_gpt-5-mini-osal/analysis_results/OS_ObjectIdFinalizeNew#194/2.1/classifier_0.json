  "scenario": "The else-if branch is reachable when OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish is invoked with final_id == NULL (meaning no ID update pending) and token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE; in that case the code restores record->active_id = token->obj_id. Although the specific caller shown (OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew) always passes a non-NULL &final_id, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish is a general utility and can be called from other places with final_id == NULL, so the else-if is not dead/unreachable."
