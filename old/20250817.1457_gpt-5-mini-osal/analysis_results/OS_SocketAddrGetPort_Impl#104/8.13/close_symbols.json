  "explanation": "To assess whether the function violates the MISRA guideline that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible you must see the actual type and qualifiers of the objects being addressed and cast: \n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: shows the exact type and qualifier of AddrData. Because Accessor is derived from &Addr->AddrData, you must know whether AddrData (as reached through a const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr) already yields a pointer-to-const or whether the cast changes/discards qualifiers.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: shows the target type of the cast. You need to verify the accessor's member types and whether casting to (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *) preserves constness or masks a qualifier mismatch.\n\n- struct sockaddr: provides the type of sa_family so you can confirm no hidden pointer-to-non-const issues arise when reading Accessor->sa.sa_family via a const accessor pointer.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6: provide the types of sin_port and sin6_port respectively. These definitions confirm that these fields are scalar integer types (not pointers) and whether accessing them through a const-qualified accessor is appropriate.\n\n- in_port_t: used for sa_port and passed to ntohs; knowing it is an integer type (not a pointer) is necessary to conclude no pointer constness problem in the conversion/assignment.\n\n- uint16 and int32 typedefs: confirm the underlying types used in the function signature and return value. In particular, confirming that PortNum is a pointer to a writable uint16 (and that the function writes *PortNum) is needed to justify that PortNum cannot be const.\n\nCollectively these symbols let you determine whether any const qualifier is being removed (or should be added) by the cast and member accesses, and whether any pointer could/should be declared to point to const instead of non-const."
