  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl(uint16 *PortNum, const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr)\n{\n    in_port_t                     sa_port;\n    const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor;\n\n    Accessor = (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData;\n\n    switch (Accessor->sa.sa_family)\n    {\n        case AF_INET:\n            sa_port = Accessor->sa_in.sin_port;\n            break;\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n        case AF_INET6:\n            sa_port = Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_port;\n            break;\n#endif\n        default:\n            return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    *PortNum = ntohs(sa_port);\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The four assignments setting conn_record, sock_record, sock, and conn to NULL at the start of OS_SocketAccept are redundant. Each pointer is assigned a valid value before any use in the normal control flow (assignments occur only when return_code == OS_SUCCESS), and no code relies on them being NULL if the function returns early. Therefore removing these four assignments would not affect program behaviour. They are executed but unnecessary, so this constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl(uint16 *PortNum, const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr)\n{\n    in_port_t                     sa_port;\n    const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor;\n\n    /* Open probe log (append) to record control flow and key state. */\n    FILE *probe_log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/834.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (probe_log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(probe_log, \"OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl entry: Addr=%p PortNum=%p\\n\", (void *)Addr, (void *)PortNum);\n    }\n\n    Accessor = (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData;\n\n    if (probe_log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(probe_log, \"sa_family=%d\\n\", (int)Accessor->sa.sa_family);\n    }\n\n    switch (Accessor->sa.sa_family)\n    {\n        case AF_INET:\n            sa_port = Accessor->sa_in.sin_port;\n            if (probe_log != NULL)\n            {\n                fprintf(probe_log, \"path=AF_INET raw_port=0x%04x (%u)\\n\", (unsigned)sa_port, (unsigned)sa_port);\n            }\n            break;\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n        case AF_INET6:\n            sa_port = Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_port;\n            if (probe_log != NULL)\n            {\n                fprintf(probe_log, \"path=AF_INET6 raw_port=0x%04x (%u)\\n\", (unsigned)sa_port, (unsigned)sa_port);\n            }\n            break;\n#endif\n        default:\n            if (probe_log != NULL)\n            {\n                fprintf(probe_log, \"path=DEFAULT bad_family=%d returning=%d\\n\", (int)Accessor->sa.sa_family, (int)OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS);\n                fclose(probe_log);\n            }\n            return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    /* Convert network byte order port to host order and log the result. */\n    *PortNum = ntohs(sa_port);\n\n    if (probe_log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(probe_log, \"converted_port=%u return=%d\\n\", (unsigned)*PortNum, (int)OS_SUCCESS);\n        fclose(probe_log);\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl.

  "explanation": "The report is incorrect. Agent A's scenario complains about four NULL assignments in OS_SocketAccept, but the supplied target function is OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl and contains none of those assignments \u2014 the report is therefore misattributed. Examining OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl: there are no executed, redundant operations whose removal would not affect behavior. The only questionable token is the \"break;\" after the \"return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;\" in the default label; that code is unreachable, and per MISRA Note 2 unreachable code is not classified as dead code under Rule 2.2. The added probe logging and empty log only show the function was not exercised by the test; they do not demonstrate any executed dead code in the shown implementation. Therefore the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct for the provided function."
