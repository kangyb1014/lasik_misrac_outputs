  "explanation": "The function signature is included because it declares pointer parameters (one non-const pointer) and thus is the primary subject of Rule 17.8. The Accessor assignment takes the address of a member via the Addr parameter and uses a cast, so it should be inspected to ensure the Addr pointer itself is not being modified. The write to *PortNum updates the object pointed to (which is permitted by the rule) but should be checked to confirm the pointer variable PortNum is not reassigned elsewhere. Other code lines (variable declarations, switch/case reads of Accessor->..., breaks, and return statements) only read from the pointer-referenced objects or operate on local variables; there are no assignments that alter the value of the parameter variables Addr or PortNum themselves, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 17.8."
