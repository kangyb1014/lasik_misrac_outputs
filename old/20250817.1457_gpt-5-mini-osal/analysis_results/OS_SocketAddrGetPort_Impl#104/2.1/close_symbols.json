  "explanation": "To decide whether any portion of OS_SocketAddrGetPort_Impl is unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code), the analyzer must know the concrete types, members, constants and configuration that govern control flow and value ranges:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: definition (including layout/alignment) is required because the function indexes into Addr->AddrData; knowing the type shows how AddrData maps to socket address storage and whether the cast to the accessor can legitimately read sa_family.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: the accessor struct defines sa, sa_in and sa_in6 members used in the switch and in extracting ports. Its definition reveals whether sa.sa_family is a valid discriminant and which union/fields exist (affects reachability of cases).\n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t): explicit knowledge of this member (size/type) is needed to confirm the cast (&Addr->AddrData -> OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *) is well-defined and whether reading sa_family could be UB or always a specific value.\n- sa.sa_family (field) / sa_family_t typedef: the type and possible value domain of sa_family determine which switch cases (AF_INET, AF_INET6, default) are possible \u2014 necessary to prove or disprove that some case labels or the default are unreachable.\n- sa_in.sin_port (field) / struct sockaddr_in: definition of sin_port (type and location) is required to verify the Accessor->sa_in.sin_port expression is valid and reachable when sa_family == AF_INET.\n- sa_in6.sin6_port (field) / struct sockaddr_in6: same for sin6_port for the AF_INET6 case (and to know whether that field exists at the same offset as used by the accessor).\n- in_port_t: underlying integer type used for sa_port; needed to reason about conversions, ranges, and whether any conversion could cause UB or constant-fold to specific values that affect reachability analysis.\n- AF_INET: numeric value used in the switch; needed to know if sa_family can equal this value and whether the case label is distinct from others.\n- AF_INET6: numeric value used in the switch; presence/definition is needed, and to compare with sa_family domain to determine reachability of that case.\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: preprocessor macro that controls whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled in. Its definition (present/absent) decides whether the AF_INET6 case is present at all; this affects whether code under that case is reachable or considered unreachable by the compiled configuration.\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS: return value used in the default branch; include to determine whether default branch is meaningful and to check for any constant folding or removal by the compiler (e.g., static analysis of constants may show default unreachable if other cases are exhaustive and known).\n- OS_SUCCESS: function return on success; include to understand the normal return path and whether code after switch is reachable.\n- ntohs: the byte-order conversion function applied to sa_port. Its declaration/semantics are needed to ensure no side effects or UB that could change reachability reasoning; also used to determine whether the assignment to *PortNum is always executed for the handled cases.\n\nProviding these symbols (types, fields, constants, and the compile-time IPv6 feature macro) enables a precise determination of whether any switch labels, the default case, or subsequent code are provably unreachable under the build configuration and type/value domains, which is required to assess a violation of the MISRA rule against unreachable code."
