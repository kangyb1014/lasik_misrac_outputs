  "explanation": "No use of memcmp appears in the provided function or related symbol definitions. The function body contains only a comment and a return of OS_SUCCESS; there are no string comparisons or calls to memcmp (or other compare functions) on the filename/name arrays. The struct fields are only definitions and are not used here. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that violate or require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (usage of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp usage exists, it is not present in the supplied code and would need to be supplied to be reviewed."
