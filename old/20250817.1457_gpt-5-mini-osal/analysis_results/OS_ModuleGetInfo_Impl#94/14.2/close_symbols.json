The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Needed to rule out any hidden or indirect for-loops or loop-counter effects inside the target function:\n\n- OS_object_token_t: This identifier appears in the function parameter list. Although it is a type, it could be a macro/typedef that expands to something unexpected (e.g., a macro that injects code) or a type whose definition contains inline functions or macros that include for-loops. Inspecting its definition ensures there are no hidden for-statements or side-effecting macros that would make the function violate the MISRA for-loop rule.\n\n- OS_module_prop_t: Same rationale as OS_object_token_t. The module_prop parameter type might be a typedef or macro that could introduce inline code or macros with loops; its definition must be checked to ensure no for-loops or loop-counter modifications are implicitly present.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this symbol. If OS_SUCCESS is a macro (or macro-like constant) that expands to code (e.g., an expression or invocation that could contain control structures) it could introduce a for-loop or side effects relevant to the MISRA rule. Confirming it is a simple constant ensures the function contains no for-loops.\n\n- int32: The return type name is used in the function signature. Verifying the typedef/definition of int32 confirms there are no unexpected macro expansions that could inject code (such as for-loops) into the function signature.\n\nAdditional note: The static call graph shows the target has no callees. Therefore no other functions need to be inspected for loops called from within this function. The above symbols are sufficient to confirm there are no hidden for-loops or loop-counter modifications inside the target function."
