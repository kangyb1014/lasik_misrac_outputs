  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl can violate the MISRA rule about string.h bounds accesses we need to be sure the function body is truly inert and does not expand into or call any string-handling operations via macros or typedefs: \n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function simply returns this symbol. It must be checked to ensure it is a plain constant (macro or enum) and not a macro or inline function that could expand to code using string.h functions (or other memory accesses). If OS_SUCCESS were a complex macro or expression it could introduce out-of-bounds string operations. \n\n- OS_object_token_t: Present in the function parameter list. Even though the parameters are unused in the body, the typedef/name must be examined to ensure it is not a macro that expands to code (for example, an expression or accessor) that could invoke string operations when the function is compiled or instrumented. \n\n- OS_module_prop_t: Same rationale as OS_object_token_t \u2014 verify it is a plain type and not a macro or construct that injects string-handling calls or memory accesses into the function. Also confirms no implicit initializers or attributes will introduce string function usage. \n\n- int32: Verify this is a simple typedef (e.g., typedef int32_t int32) and not a macro or function-like construct that could introduce side effects or calls to string.h functions via expansion.\n\nNo other symbols are required because the implementation contains no explicit calls to any string.h functions and has no callees; the above symbols are sufficient to rule out hidden expansions or side effects that could cause out-of-bounds string accesses."
