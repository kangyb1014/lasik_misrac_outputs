  "explanation": "I found no uses of the standard string-handling functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the provided code. The implementation of OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl simply returns OS_SUCCESS and performs no operations on the module_prop or token parameters. The related type definitions only declare fixed-size char arrays (filename, name) but contain no code that reads from or writes to those arrays. There is no pointer arithmetic, no calls to functions that might copy or examine those arrays, and no other code fragments that could produce out-of-bounds accesses within the supplied snippet. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 21.17 in the provided code. (Note: potential violations could occur in other parts of the code that actually populate or manipulate OS_module_prop_t fields, but those parts were not included and thus are outside the scope of this review.)"
