  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided function. The implementation contains only standard C constructs: a function definition, a return statement returning a macro constant (OS_SUCCESS), and comments. The types referenced (int32, OS_object_token_t, OS_module_prop_t) are typedefs/structs and not compiler extensions. The comment mentioning dlinfo refers to a platform/library extension but does not invoke any non-standard language or compiler-specific feature in the code. No GCC/Clang/MSVC-specific keywords or constructs (for example __attribute__, __declspec, asm, typeof, statement-expressions, inline-assembly, or other documented compiler extensions) appear in the function, so there are no fragments to flag for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
