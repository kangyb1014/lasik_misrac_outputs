  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl takes two parameters: a const OS_object_token_t *token and an OS_module_prop_t *module_prop. The function body contains only a return statement (return OS_SUCCESS;) and does not read from, write to, or reassign either parameter. The token parameter is declared const, preventing modification of the pointed-to object, and neither pointer variable is reassigned in the body (which would violate Rule 17.8). There are also no casts, pointer arithmetic, or other operations involving these parameters anywhere in the provided code. Therefore there are no places in this function that potentially modify a function parameter and no fragments need further investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
