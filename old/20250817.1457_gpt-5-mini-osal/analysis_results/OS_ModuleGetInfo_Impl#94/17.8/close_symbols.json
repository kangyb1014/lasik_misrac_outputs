  "explanation": "OS_object_token_t: Need the typedef/struct definition to confirm the exact indirection and constness semantics. For example, if OS_object_token_t is itself a pointer typedef (typedef T *OS_object_token_t) the declaration const OS_object_token_t *token would have different pointer levels and change what \"modifying the parameter\" means. Also verify there are no unusual attributes or macros on the type that could implicitly modify the parameter.\n\nOS_module_prop_t: Required to determine whether this identifier is a plain struct/type or a pointer typedef. If OS_module_prop_t is itself a pointer type (or has qualifiers) then the parameter OS_module_prop_t *module_prop may be a pointer-to-pointer or carry const qualifiers that affect whether modifying the parameter or the pointed object would violate MISRA. This lets the analyzer decide whether any potential writes would modify the parameter variable itself or only the pointed object.\n\nint32: Provide the typedef (e.g., typedef int32_t int32) to ensure the return type or any macros don't expand to something that could alias or impact parameters; primarily to rule out any surprising macro/attribute that could change interpretation of the function signature.\n\nOS_SUCCESS: Supply the macro/constant definition to confirm it is a simple constant (no function-like macro or expression with side effects). If OS_SUCCESS were defined in an unusual way that referenced or modified parameters (unlikely but possible via macro expansion), that would be relevant to the MISRA check."
