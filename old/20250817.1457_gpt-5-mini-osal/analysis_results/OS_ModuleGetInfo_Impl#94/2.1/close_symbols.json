  "explanation": "- OS_SUCCESS: Needed to verify that the return statement is a plain value and does not expand to code that could introduce unreachable statements or side-effects. If OS_SUCCESS is a macro or complex expression it could affect control flow or create additional statements.\n- OS_ModuleInfo: This function is the immediate caller (per the call graph). To decide if OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl is reachable (and therefore not dead/unreachable code) we must inspect the caller to see whether the call is executed unconditionally or only under unreachable/disabled conditions.\n- OS_object_token_t: The parameter type definition may include attributes or macros (e.g., function-like macros, annotations) that affect compilation or linkage; include it to ensure the function signature isn't conditionally removed or altered such that the function becomes unreachable.\n- OS_module_prop_t: Same rationale as OS_object_token_t \u2014 type/annotation definitions or macros might affect inclusion or visibility of the function.\n- All callers of OS_ModuleInfo (transitive, up to program entry points such as main or startup routines): To determine whether the target function is actually reachable at runtime (not just syntactically reachable from one caller), you must follow the call chain from OS_ModuleInfo back to program entry points. If no path from an entry point reaches OS_ModuleInfo, then OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl may be dead (unreachable) in the whole project.\n- Build-time conditional macros that control inclusion of OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl / OS_ModuleInfo (feature/configuration macros): Conditional compilation (e.g., #ifdef) can make a function or its callers absent from a particular build. The build/configuration macros that surround these functions must be known to determine if either function is compiled in \u2014 otherwise apparent code may be unreachable because it was never included.\n- Any alternate/weak linker definitions of OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl (replacement implementations): If there are weak/alternate definitions that replace or override this implementation, the presented implementation might never be linked/used; knowing such variants is required to determine actual reachability in the final linked image."
