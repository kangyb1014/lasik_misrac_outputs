  "explanation": "The only pointer in the provided function signature that is not const-qualified is the module_prop parameter; this should be investigated to determine whether it must be writable (output) or could/should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type. The token parameter is already a pointer to const and therefore complies with Rule 8.13. Other declarations in the additional code (cpuaddr members, arrays char filename[], char name[], OS_module_address_t addr, and the opaque typedef 'typedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t') are not pointer types that would be affected by Rule 8.13, or are already const-qualified where applicable, so they do not require investigation for this rule."
