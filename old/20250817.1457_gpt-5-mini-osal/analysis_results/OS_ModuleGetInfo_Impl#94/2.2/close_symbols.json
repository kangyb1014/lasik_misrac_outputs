  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl is dead code (i.e. its removal would not affect program behaviour) you must examine its callers and any symbols that influence how its call/result affect system behaviour, plus the types/values it uses: \n\n- OS_ModuleInfo: The immediate caller. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it calls OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl unconditionally, conditionally, whether it uses the return value or relies on side-effects (e.g. filling module_prop). If OS_ModuleInfo's behaviour depends on this call, the implementation is not dead.\n\n- OS_printf, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease: These are OS_ModuleInfo's callees (per the static call graph). Examining them lets you see whether OS_ModuleInfo's observable behaviour (logging, object lookup/release, indexing) depends on results or side-effects produced by OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl; this is necessary to judge whether removing the Impl call would change behaviour.\n\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These test/harness symbols appear in OS_ModuleInfo's call graph. You need them to determine if OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl can be invoked via test hooks, stubs, or registered handlers (affecting test-time behaviour), and whether removal would change test or runtime behaviour through the harness.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The return macro/value used by OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl. Knowing its semantic meaning and how callers treat that return value is required to determine if returning this value (versus not calling the function) influences control flow elsewhere.\n\n- OS_object_token_t, OS_module_prop_t: The parameter and output types. If callers expect the implementation to populate module_prop or rely on token side-effects, removal could change behaviour. You must inspect these type definitions and any contracts about the contents of module_prop.\n\n- int32: The return type alias (or typedef) used by the function; needed to understand error/success code semantics and how callers interpret the returned integer.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyzer determine (a) whether the function is ever invoked in production or test code paths, (b) whether its return value or side-effects are used, and (c) whether removing the function call would change program observable behaviour (thus constituting non-dead code) or not (dead code)."
