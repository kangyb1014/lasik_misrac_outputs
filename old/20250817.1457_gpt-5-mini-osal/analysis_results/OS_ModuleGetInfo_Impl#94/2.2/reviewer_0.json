  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, OS_module_prop_t *module_prop)\n{\n    /*\n     * Limiting strictly to POSIX-defined API means there is no defined\n     * method to get information about a module contents.\n     *\n     * The \"dlinfo()\" function might return some interesting information\n     * but this is actually a non-posix extension / platform-defined API.\n     *\n     * This returns success - although there is no information to add here,\n     * the parent/shared layer information is still valid.\n     */\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl is called from OS_ModuleInfo to potentially augment module_prop, but the implementation simply returns OS_SUCCESS and performs no operations or side-effects (it does not use token or modify module_prop). The call is therefore executed but its removal (or replacing it with return_code = OS_SUCCESS) would not change program behaviour. This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, OS_module_prop_t *module_prop)\n{\n    /*\n     * Limiting strictly to POSIX-defined API means there is no defined\n     * method to get information about a module contents.\n     *\n     * The \"dlinfo()\" function might return some interesting information\n     * but this is actually a non-posix extension / platform-defined API.\n     *\n     * This returns success - although there is no information to add here,\n     * the parent/shared layer information is still valid.\n     */\n\n    /* Probe logging: append control-flow and state info so other agents can\n     * reproduce and gather evidence for the reported dead-code scenario.\n     * Do not modify token or module_prop; preserve original behavior. */\n    FILE *logf = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/754.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (logf != NULL)\n    {\n        time_t now = time(NULL);\n        /* Log invocation time and pointer values; avoid dereferencing unknown types. */\n        (void)fprintf(logf, \"OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl invoked: time=%ld, token=%p, module_prop=%p\\n\",\n                      (long)now, (const void *)token, (const void *)module_prop);\n\n        (void)fprintf(logf, \"token_is_null=%d, module_prop_is_null=%d, errno=%d\\n\",\n                      (token == NULL) ? 1 : 0,\n                      (module_prop == NULL) ? 1 : 0,\n                      errno);\n\n        /* Flush and close to ensure logs are persisted even if program terminates. */\n        (void)fflush(logf);\n        (void)fclose(logf);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* If logging fails, do not alter behavior; keep returning success. */\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead code \u2014 code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Simply observing that OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl currently returns a constant (OS_SUCCESS) and does not touch its parameters is not sufficient to prove the code is dead. Whether a call can be removed without changing behaviour requires whole-program reasoning: the call may affect execution timing, stack usage, ordering, or other platform-dependent side effects (note 1 to the rule). In addition, this function is an intentional platform-specific stub implementing an API contract (it communicates the absence of module info while preserving the shared-layer behaviour). Such stubs are common and not automatically \u201cdead code.\u201d The provided runtime logging test not exercising the function does not prove the function is dead in the project either. To demonstrate a Rule 2.2 violation you must show that every execution of this operation (in all program contexts) could be removed or replaced without changing observable behaviour; that proof is not provided here. Therefore the agent A report is not correct."
