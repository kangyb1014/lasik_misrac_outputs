  "explanation": "No pointer in this function can be const-qualified without changing semantics. The OS_FdSet *Set parameter is written to (Set->object_ids[...] &= ...), so the pointed-to object must be mutable and cannot be const. The address-of local_id (&local_id) is an output parameter passed to OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex and thus cannot be const. There are no other pointer parameters or pointer-to-data uses that could be made const (the OS_CHECK_POINTER(Set) macro only inspects the pointer for validity). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
