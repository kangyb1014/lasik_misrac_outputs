Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are not suspicious for dead-code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: the variable declarations (int32 return_code; osal_index_t local_id;) are non-executable declarations; comments and block delimiters are non-executable; the function signature and closing brace are structural; and the final return statement is part of the function API and affects behavior. There are no other executable statements in this function that could be removed without potentially changing program behavior, so they do not need investigation for dead code."
