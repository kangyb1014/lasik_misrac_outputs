  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SelectFdClear:\n```c\nint32 OS_SelectFdClear(OS_FdSet *Set, osal_id_t objid)\n{\n    int32        return_code;\n    osal_index_t local_id;\n\n    /* check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(Set);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_STREAM, objid, &local_id);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /*\n         * Clears the bit in the uint8 object_ids array that corresponds\n         * to the local_id where local_id >> 3 determines the array element,\n         * and the mask/shift clears the bit within that element.\n         */\n        Set->object_ids[local_id >> 3] &= ~(1 << (local_id & 0x7));\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nSet->object_ids[local_id >> 3] &= ~(1 << (local_id & 0x7));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The statement clears a specific bit in Set->object_ids and is executed when OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex returns OS_SUCCESS. Removing this operation would change program behaviour (the file-descriptor bit would not be cleared and subsequent code that reads the fd set would see different state), so it is not dead code. (Only if the array were never examined later would it be dead, but in the intended OS_SelectFdClear/Select usage it is meaningful.)"
