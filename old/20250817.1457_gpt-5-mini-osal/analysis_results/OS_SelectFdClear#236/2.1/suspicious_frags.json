  "explanation": "Fragments not listed are plain constant definitions, simple assignments or returns, or single-line operations that do not by themselves indicate unreachable code. The selected fragments are control-flow points or macros that can cause non-local exits or branches that could be impossible/redundant depending on macro definitions or runtime invariants: - OS_CHECK_POINTER / BUGCHECK macros (their implementation may perform non-local exit or be no-ops) can make subsequent code unreachable in some configurations. - The if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) block in OS_SelectFdClear depends on the possible return values of OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex; if that call can never return success for the provided idtype/object_id domain, the block would be unreachable. - The conditional branches in OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex (type-check branch, max_id == 0 branch, and success branch that writes *ArrayIndex) are control-flow paths that may be unreachable depending on OS_GetMaxForObjectType, ObjectId-to-type mapping, or caller expectations. - The OS_printf initial BUGCHECK_VOID and the subsequent GlobalState / PrintfEnabled branches are runtime-control branches that may be permanently true/false depending on initialization code. Other lines such as simple macro constant definitions (#define OS_SUCCESS (0), #define OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_STREAM 0x06), plain variable declarations, and single return statements do not by themselves indicate unreachable code and thus were not included."
