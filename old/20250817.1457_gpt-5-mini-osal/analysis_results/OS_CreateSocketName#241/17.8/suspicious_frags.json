  "explanation": "No function parameter pointer is modified in this function. token, Addr and parent_name are only read, dereferenced, or passed to other functions; there are no assignments to the pointer variables (e.g., token = ..., Addr = ..., parent_name = ...), no pointer arithmetic modifying those parameters, and only the objects they refer to (e.g., sock->stream_name, port) are written. The use of *token with OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and passing Addr/parent_name to other functions are read-only operations allowed by the rule."
