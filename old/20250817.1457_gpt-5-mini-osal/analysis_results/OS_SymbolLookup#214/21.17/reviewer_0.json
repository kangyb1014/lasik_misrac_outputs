Although StaticSym->Name is tested for NULL earlier, there is no check that either StaticSym->Name or SymbolName (or StaticSym->Module when ModuleName != NULL) is a properly terminated buffer of known bounds.

  "explanation": "The claim as stated is not verifiable from the provided OS_SymbolLookup source alone. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns calls to functions in <string.h> (e.g. strcmp) that can read past object bounds if the operands are not valid NUL-terminated buffers. The shown OS_SymbolLookup does not call any <string.h> functions itself \u2014 it only checks the pointers for NULL (via OS_CHECK_POINTER) and forwards SymbolName to OS_SymbolLookup_Impl and, on failure, to OS_SymbolLookup_Static. A real Rule 21.17 violation would occur at the site where strcmp (or another string function) is actually called if that site does not guarantee both operands are valid, nul-terminated objects of adequate bounds.\n\nTherefore: (a) If OS_SymbolLookup_Static or OS_SymbolLookup_Impl perform strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) (or compare StaticSym->Module to ModuleName) without ensuring the pointers refer to valid NUL-terminated strings (and that StaticSym->Module is non-NULL before comparing), then those implementations would indeed violate Rule 21.17. (b) But based only on the code shown for OS_SymbolLookup, there is no direct evidence of a Rule 21.17 violation in this function itself. The test/logging added by agent A does not exercise or show the strcmp usage either.\n\nRecommendation: Inspect the implementations OS_SymbolLookup_Static and OS_SymbolLookup_Impl. At any strcmp/str* call ensure the operands are non-NULL and proven NUL-terminated (or use bounded APIs such as strncmp with documented buffer lengths, or maintain explicit length fields). Also check for NULL StaticSym->Module before comparing to ModuleName. Without that inspection, the report as applied to OS_SymbolLookup is not correct."
