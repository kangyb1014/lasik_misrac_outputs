  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No fragment in the provided code is provably unreachable. Reasoning by function:\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup: The initial pointer checks are macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER) that validate inputs; they do not remove subsequent code from being reachable for valid (non-NULL) inputs. The call to OS_SymbolLookup_Impl may return OS_SUCCESS or a non-success code; in the non-success case the conditional block that calls OS_SymbolLookup_Static is reachable. The inner conditional that assigns return_code when staticsym_status == OS_SUCCESS is reachable when the static lookup succeeds.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Impl: The first lookup call sets status. If status != OS_SUCCESS the code enters the module-iteration loop; that loop body is reachable when there are active modules and the initial lookup failed. The break and subsequent iterator-destroy are reachable when a module contains the symbol. The final return(status) is reachable on all control-flow paths.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Static: The while loop is entered when OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE is non-NULL; the check for StaticSym->Name == NULL is reachable for the sentinel entry pattern used here. The strcmp branches for matching name/module and the assignment to *SymbolAddress are reachable when a matching static symbol exists. If the table pointer is NULL the while loop is simply not entered and the initial return_code (OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) is returned \u2014 this is intended behavior, not unreachable code.\n\n- Macros and definitions (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_SUCCESS, etc.): None expand here to make any following code syntactically unreachable for all builds. Even if BUGCHECK causes an early exit on invalid inputs, that only makes code unreachable on that invalid-input path; the code remains reachable for valid inputs. Therefore there are no code fragments that are dead/unreachable in all circumstances and nothing needs to be marked for further investigation for Rule 2.1."
