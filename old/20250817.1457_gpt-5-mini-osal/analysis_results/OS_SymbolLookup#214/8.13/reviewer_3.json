In that case the call staticsym_status = OS_SymbolLookup_Static(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, NULL); passes a const char * (SymbolName) to a non-const char * parameter, discarding the const qualifier and thus violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If, however, OS_SymbolLookup_Static's prototype already takes a const char * for the symbol name, there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_SymbolLookup_Log(const cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName, const char *event, int32 code)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1715.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging cannot be performed, silently continue to preserve original behavior */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    char namebuf[129];\n    namebuf[0] = '\\0';\n    if (SymbolName != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Copy at most 128 chars to avoid excessively long log lines and ensure NUL termination */\n        strncpy(namebuf, SymbolName, sizeof(namebuf) - 1);\n        namebuf[sizeof(namebuf) - 1] = '\\0';\n    }\n\n    /* Log event, returned/inspected codes, pointer values and truncated name */\n    fprintf(f, \"OS_SymbolLookup: event=%s, code=%d, SymbolAddress=%p, SymbolName_ptr=%p, SymbolName=\\\"%s\\\"\\n\",\n            (event != NULL) ? event : \"(null)\", (int)code, (void *)SymbolAddress, (void *)SymbolName,\n            (SymbolName != NULL) ? namebuf : \"(null)\");\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    int32 staticsym_status;\n\n    /*\n    ** Check parameters\n    */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolAddress);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolName);\n\n    /* Log entry and parameters before calling platform-specific lookup */\n    OS_SymbolLookup_Log(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, \"entry_before_impl\", 0);\n\n    /*\n     * attempt to find the symbol in the symbol table\n     */\n    return_code = OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /* Log result from platform-specific implementation */\n    OS_SymbolLookup_Log(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, \"after_impl\", return_code);\n\n    /*\n     * If the OS call did not find the symbol or the loader is\n     * disabled, then check if a static symbol table is present\n     */\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Log that we will attempt the static lookup.

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s scenario is correct in principle but slightly imprecise about where the violation lies. The OS_SymbolLookup implementation shown is compliant with the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because its parameter is declared as const char * (i.e. it already points to a const-qualified type). However, if the prototype of OS_SymbolLookup_Static were declared with a non-const char * parameter (e.g. int32 OS_SymbolLookup_Static(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, char *SymbolName, void *arg)), then that prototype would be contrary to Rule 8.13 (a pointer parameter that could/should be const is not const-qualified). In that case the call OS_SymbolLookup_Static(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, NULL) would also perform an implicit qualifier discard (passing a const char * to a char * parameter), which is undesirable and would typically trigger a compiler diagnostic and is at least a violation of MISRA\u2019s rules about qualifier discards. The fact that the test compiled and produced no logs suggests the actual OS_SymbolLookup_Static prototype in the build is already const-correct (takes const char *), so no violation was observed. Recommended fix: ensure OS_SymbolLookup_Static\u2019s SymbolName parameter is declared as const char * to satisfy Rule 8.13 and avoid qualifier-discard issues."
