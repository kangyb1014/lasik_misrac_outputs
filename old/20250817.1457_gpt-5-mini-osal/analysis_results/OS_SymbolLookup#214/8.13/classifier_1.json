  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment as written does not itself violate Rule 8.13. The caller passes a const-qualified pointer (const char *SymbolName) unchanged. A violation would occur if the implementation prototype is declared to take a non-const pointer (for example: int32 OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, char *SymbolName)), which would discard the const qualifier and violate the rule. Ensure OS_SymbolLookup_Impl\u2019s second parameter is declared as const char * to avoid the violation."
