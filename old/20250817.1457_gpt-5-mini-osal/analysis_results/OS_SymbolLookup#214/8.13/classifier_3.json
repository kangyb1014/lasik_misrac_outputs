  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Violation occurs if OS_SymbolLookup_Static is declared with a non-const parameter for the symbol name (for example: int32 OS_SymbolLookup_Static(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, char *SymbolName, void *arg)). In that case the call staticsym_status = OS_SymbolLookup_Static(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, NULL); passes a const char * (SymbolName) to a non-const char * parameter, discarding the const qualifier and thus violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. If, however, OS_SymbolLookup_Static's prototype already takes a const char * for the symbol name, there is no violation."
