  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragments. I inspected the code for common vendor/GNU extensions (examples: __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), nested functions, labels-as-values, GNU inline variations, long double/int128 vendor types, or other compiler-specific keywords) and found none. The code uses standard C constructs: typedefs based on standard stdint types (int32_t, uintptr_t), ordinary casts (including pointer-to\u2011uintptr_t cast), pointer arithmetic (++StaticSym), standard function definitions and control flow, and macros invoked in a conventional manner. Therefore there are no code fragments here that explicitly use language extensions and that would need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. Note: a few identifiers used here (for example BUGCHECK via OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE, and other macros or helper functions) do not have their definitions shown in the provided snippets. If those macro or function definitions (outside the shown code) use compiler-specific extensions, they would need to be reviewed \u2014 but based solely on the provided code there is no direct evidence of language extensions to report."
