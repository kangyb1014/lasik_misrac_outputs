  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SymbolLookup:\n```c\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    int32 staticsym_status;\n\n    /*\n    ** Check parameters\n    */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolAddress);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(SymbolName);\n\n    /*\n     * attempt to find the symbol in the symbol table\n     */\n    return_code = OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /*\n     * If the OS call did not find the symbol or the loader is\n     * disabled, then check if a static symbol table is present\n     */\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        staticsym_status = OS_SymbolLookup_Static(SymbolAddress, SymbolName, NULL);\n\n        /*\n         * Only overwrite the return code if static lookup was successful.\n         * Otherwise keep the error code from the low level implementation.\n         */\n        if (staticsym_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            return_code = staticsym_status;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SymbolLookup:\n#define OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,OS_INVALID_POINTER)\n...\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32            status;\n    int32            local_status;\n    OS_object_iter_t iter;\n\n    /* First search global table */\n    status = OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /* If not found iterate through module local symbols and break if found */\n    if (status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE, &iter);\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            local_status = OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(&iter.token, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n            if (local_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n            {\n                status = local_status;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(void *dl_handle, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    const char *dlError; /*  Pointer to error string   */\n    void *      Function;\n    int32       status;\n\n    status = OS_ERROR;\n\n    /*\n     * call dlerror() to clear any prior error that might have occurred.\n     */\n    dlerror();\n    Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);\n    dlError  = dlerror();\n\n    /*\n     * For the POSIX DL implementation, if the symbol does not exist\n     * then dlerror() is supposed to return non-null.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Each executed operation has a potential observable effect: the first dlerror() clears any prior error (necessary so the subsequent dlerror() reflects this lookup), dlsym() obtains the symbol pointer, the second dlerror() yields the lookup error string used to decide logging, OS_DEBUG emits observable diagnostic output, and *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function stores the resolved address for callers. Removing any of these statements could change error detection, logging or returned data (and possibly timing), so this is not dead code."
