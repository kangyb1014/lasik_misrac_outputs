  "explanation": "Why other fragments need NOT be investigated:\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Impl and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: these perform lookups across global and per-module symbol tables and clearly produce side effects (iterate objects, call module-specific lookups) and return status values used by callers. Their calls and control flow are relevant to program behaviour, so they are not dead code.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Static: the loop inspects a static symbol table and sets the return code to indicate whether a search was performed and whether a symbol was found. The assignment to *SymbolAddress and the return_code changes are used by callers; these operations have observable effects and thus are not dead.\n\n- Definitions such as status initializations (e.g., status = OS_ERROR; return_code defaults) are necessary default states in case of errors and are used later to determine return values; they are not dead.\n\n- UtAssert_Abort simply delegates to UT_BSP_DoText; that call is an observable side effect for test harnesses and therefore not dead.\n\n- Macro usages (e.g., BUGCHECK, BUGCHECK_VOID, OS_DEBUG, OS_CHECK_POINTER) may be implemented differently depending on build/configuration. I flagged usages of OS_CHECK_POINTER, BUGCHECK_VOID and OS_DEBUG where their presence/behavior can cause executed operations that might be no-ops in some builds (and thus potential dead code). Other macro uses in the code are either part of required error checking or produce side effects and so were not reported.\n\nNotes on the selected fragments (no further explanation about them is provided per your request)."
