  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided functions for operations that appear to be executed but could be removed without affecting program behavior (i.e., potential dead code). No such fragments were found. Reasoning by area:\n\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: clock_gettime() is required to compute an absolute expiration. Adding seconds and nanoseconds (including the modulus conversion and the rollover normalization if tv_nsec >= 1_000_000_000) is necessary to build a correct absolute timespec; removing any of these operations would change the computed timeout and therefore program behaviour.\n\n- Callers (OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl, OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl): each calls OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime and then a timed-wait API. Those calls are used and essential; branching on sem_timedwait return/errno produces different return codes, so the code paths are meaningful.\n\n- OS_QueueGet_Impl: the different branches (timeout == OS_PEND, timeout == OS_CHECK, else) all perform different, observable behaviors: blocking receive, immediate non-blocking check (memset(&ts,0) to force zero absolute timeout), or timed receive (OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime). The loops that retry on EINTR are required to handle interruptible syscalls correctly. The initialization sizeCopied = -1 and subsequent checks map errno to distinct return codes; removing those assignments or branches would alter behavior.\n\n- Other small operations (casts, initializations, return value handling) are used to ensure correct types and to return precise status codes. No unreachable code was present in the excerpts.\n\nGiven the code shown, there are no executed statements that appear redundant or removable without affecting program behavior, so there are no suspicious dead-code fragments to report."
