  "explanation": "No function parameter itself is assigned or modified in the function. The pointer parameter tm is only dereferenced and the object it points to (tm->tv_sec and tm->tv_nsec) is updated \u2014 modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8. The pointer tm itself is never assigned to (no statements like tm = ...), and the scalar parameter msecs is not modified. The call clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, tm) also modifies the object pointed to by tm (allowed). Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
