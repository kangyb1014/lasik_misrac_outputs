  "explanation": "The provided function contains no uses of memcmp or other string-comparison functions, and it does not manipulate or reference null-terminated strings (no char * or string literals). It only performs time arithmetic on a struct timespec and calls clock_gettime. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
