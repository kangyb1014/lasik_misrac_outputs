  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The things that might look non\u2011standard are not compiler extensions and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2:\n\n- clock_gettime and CLOCK_REALTIME are POSIX library symbols, not compiler language extensions.\n- struct timespec and time_t are POSIX/standard types provided by headers, not language extensions.\n- The integer suffixes (1000000L, 1000000000L) and C cast (time_t)(...) are standard C syntax.\n- The identifier uint32 is likely a project typedef (not a compiler extension). If it were a nonstandard built\u2011in compiler type, that would be documented by the compiler; as written it is simply a type name, not an extension usage.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that demonstrably use compiler language extensions that must be reported under Rule 1.2."
