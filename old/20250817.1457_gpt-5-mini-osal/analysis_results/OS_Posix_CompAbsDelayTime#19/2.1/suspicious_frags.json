  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code fragments were found in the function. Every statement is reachable from function entry: there is no early return, no infinite loop that prevents subsequent code, no goto/jump skipping code, and no code following a guaranteed non-returning call. The if (tm->tv_nsec >= 1000000000L) branch is conditional (and therefore potentially reachable depending on inputs) so it is not unreachable. The call to clock_gettime, the subsequent arithmetic on tm->tv_sec and tm->tv_nsec, and the conditional normalization are all reachable at runtime. \n\nNotes for investigators (not flagged as unreachable): ensure callers never pass a null tm (null dereference is undefined behavior, not unreachable code) and verify type ranges/time_t/tv_nsec representation to avoid signed overflow/implementation-defined behavior, but these are correctness/safety concerns rather than evidence of unreachable code under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
