  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions is present in the provided code. The fragment only calls clock_gettime and performs arithmetic and direct field accesses on the struct timespec pointed to by tm (assignments to tm->tv_sec and tm->tv_nsec, modulo, multiplication, comparison). MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically targets string-handling functions such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn; none of these (or any other <string.h> functions) appear in the code, so there are no candidate locations that could violate Rule 21.17.\n\nNote: tm is dereferenced and could be null at runtime; that is a possible issue for other MISRA rules (pointer validity/null-pointer checks), but it is not within the scope of Rule 21.17 and therefore need not be investigated for this specific rule."
