  "explanation": "- clock_gettime: The function is called with a pointer to struct timespec. To prove the target does not (directly or indirectly via its call) use any <string.h> routines that could access out-of-bounds memory, the signature and semantics of clock_gettime (it accepts a struct timespec* and writes into it) must be known.\n- CLOCK_REALTIME: The clock identifier passed to clock_gettime; include to fully specify the call site and match the correct clock_gettime overload/implementation if needed.\n- clockid_t: The type of the first parameter to clock_gettime; needed for correct declaration matching when inspecting the called API/implementation.\n- struct timespec (fields: tv_sec, tv_nsec): The target manipulates tv_sec and tv_nsec directly. The exact member types and their ranges (and whether any padding/aliasing rules apply) are required to reason about whether the arithmetic on these members could cause out-of-bounds accesses or invoke string routines indirectly.\n- time_t: tv_sec uses time_t; the underlying type (signed/unsigned width) is needed to reason about overflow/convertibility when adding (msecs/1000) and incrementing tv_sec.\n- uint32 (typedef of msecs): The concrete definition of uint32 (width, signedness) is needed to reason about the arithmetic msecs/1000 and (msecs%1000)*1000000L and ensure no implicit conversions could trigger problematic behavior.\n- <time.h> declaration/headers for clock_gettime and struct timespec: Provide the canonical declarations and any platform-specific notes about behavior of clock_gettime (e.g., whether it can call library helpers). This ensures the analysis covers whether any standard library string functions could be involved via the called API.\n\nThese symbols and declarations are sufficient to determine whether the target function itself or its direct call to clock_gettime could involve any usage of <string.h> routines that might access memory beyond the bounds of pointer parameters. No other string.h functions appear in the target, and the callers in the static call graph are not required to establish this specific MISRA C string-handling rule for the target function."
