  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The pointer tm is used as an output parameter and is written to by clock_gettime and by subsequent assignments (tm->tv_sec, tm->tv_nsec). Making it a pointer to const would prevent these valid modifications and would conflict with the clock_gettime prototype, so Rule 8.13 is not violated here. (A violation would occur if tm were only read and never modified yet declared as a non-const pointer.)"
