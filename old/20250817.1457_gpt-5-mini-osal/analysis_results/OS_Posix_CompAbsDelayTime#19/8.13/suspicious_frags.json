  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers could/should be to const-qualified types. The only pointer in this function is 'tm' (the parameter) and all uses of 'tm' are included above for investigation. Other code fragments (arithmetic on 'msecs', integer literals, comparisons, and the function-local control flow) do not involve pointer types and therefore are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and do not need to be investigated for this rule."
