  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The only parameter, sem_id, is used purely as a value when passed to OS_ObjectIdGetById and is not assigned to or altered. The address of the local variable token (&token) is passed to called functions; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter (i.e., the token object) is permitted by the rule, and this function does not modify the pointer itself. All other variables (token, return_code) are local and may be modified. Therefore there are no code fragments here that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
