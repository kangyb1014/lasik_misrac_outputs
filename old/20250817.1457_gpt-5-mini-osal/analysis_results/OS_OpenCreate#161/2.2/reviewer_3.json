In OS_TranslatePath any successful path that later uses these variables overwrites them (SysMountPointLen and VirtPathBegin are set from filesys->system_mountpt/virtual_mountpt after a successful OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch), and any error path that does not overwrite them also never uses them (the later block that reads them is guarded by if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)). Therefore removing these two initial assignments would not change program behaviour.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\ntypedef int32_t int32;\ntypedef uint32_t osal_id_t;\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int32 value;\n} OS_object_token_t;\nstruct OS_stream_internal_record_t\n{\n    char stream_name[128];\n    /* other fields omitted */\n};\ntypedef struct OS_stream_internal_record_t\n{\n    char stream_name[128];\n    /* other fields omitted */\n} OS_stream_internal_record_t;\nextern int32 OS_TranslatePath(const char *path, char *local_path);\nextern int32 OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(int type, void *arg, OS_object_token_t *token);\nextern int32 OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew(int32 result, OS_object_token_t *token, osal_id_t *out_id);\nextern int32 OS_FileOpen_Impl(OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path, int32 flags, int32 access_mode);\nextern OS_stream_internal_record_t *OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(void *table, OS_object_token_t token);\nextern void OS_OBJECT_INIT(OS_object_token_t token, OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream, char *stream_name, const char *path);\nstatic void os_log_probe(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1290.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_OpenCreate(osal_id_t *filedes, const char *path, int32 flags, int32 access_mode)\n{\n    int32                        return_code;\n    char                         local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n    OS_object_token_t            token;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n\n    /* Check parameters (expanded instead of macro) */\n    if (filedes == NULL)\n    {\n        return OS_INVALID_POINTER;\n    }\n\n    /* Initialize file descriptor */\n    *filedes = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED;\n\n    /* Log entry and initial state */\n    os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate ENTRY: filedes_ptr=%p, initial_filedes=%d, path=\\\"%s\\\", flags=%d, access_mode=%d\",\n                 (void *)filedes, (int)*filedes, path ? path : \"(null)\", (int)flags, (int)access_mode);\n\n    /*\n    ** Check for a valid access mode\n    */\n    if (access_mode != OS_WRITE_ONLY && access_mode != OS_READ_ONLY && access_mode != OS_READ_WRITE)\n    {\n        os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: invalid access_mode=%d -> returning OS_ERROR\", (int)access_mode);\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * Translate the path\n     */\n    os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: calling OS_TranslatePath with path=\\\"%s\\\"\", path ? path : \"(null)\");\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(path, (char *)local_path);\n    os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: OS_TranslatePath returned %d, local_path=\\\"%s\\\"\",\n                 (int)return_code, local_path[0] ? local_path : \"(empty)\");\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Note - the common ObjectIdAllocate routine will lock the object type and leave it locked. */\n        os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: calling OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew\");\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, NULL, &token);\n        /* Print the token's address instead of casting the aggregate to int */\n        os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew returned %d, token=%p\", (int)return_code, (const void *)&token);\n        if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, token);\n            os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: stream_ptr=%p (token=%p)\", (void *)stream, (const void *)&token);\n\n            /* Reset the table entry and save the name */\n            OS_OBJECT_INIT(token, stream, stream->stream_name, path);\n            os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: OS_OBJECT_INIT called for token=%p, stream_name=\\\"%s\\\"\",\n                         (const void *)&token, path ? path : \"(null)\");\n\n            /* Now call the OS-specific implementation.  */\n            os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: calling OS_FileOpen_Impl with local_path=\\\"%s\\\", flags=%d, access_mode=%d\",\n                         local_path[0] ? local_path : \"(empty)\", (int)flags, (int)access_mode);\n            return_code = OS_FileOpen_Impl(&token, local_path, flags, access_mode);\n            os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: OS_FileOpen_Impl returned %d\", (int)return_code);\n\n            /* Check result, finalize record, and unlock global table. */\n            return_code = OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew(return_code, &token, filedes);\n            os_log_probe(\"OS_OpenCreate: OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew returned %d, final_filedes=%d\",\n                         (int)return_code, filedes ?

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The agent's claim concerns two assignments inside OS_TranslatePath, but the submitted target code is OS_OpenCreate and the provided test never exercised or reproduced the alleged dead assignments (the test code failed to compile). You cannot establish a Rule 2.2 violation from the evidence given for several reasons:\n\n- The alleged dead operations are inside OS_TranslatePath, which was not provided, so there is no definitive evidence that those writes are executed in all cases and also that their removal would not affect behaviour. Dead-code classification requires whole-program reasoning about every execution path; that is not present here.\n\n- MISRA C 2023 Note 3 explicitly states that initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is not a candidate for dead code. If those writes are initializations intended to avoid use of an uninitialised object, they are not considered dead code by the standard and removing them could introduce undefined behaviour.\n\n- Even if the variables are overwritten on one success path and not used on error paths, one must prove that no other execution path or later use can observe the written values. The agent's argument only sketches one path; it does not show a complete proof that removal would not change behaviour in every case.\n\n- The provided runtime logging attempt failed to compile, so no dynamic evidence was produced to support the claim.\n\nGiven the missing OS_TranslatePath implementation, the MISRA note about initializations, and the lack of a complete proof or working test, the reported violation of Rule 2.2 cannot be accepted based on the submitted materials."
