If either pointer is NULL or points to a non\u2011NUL\u2011terminated buffer (for example, a caller passed NULL as TypeName or a previously registered ContentTypeStr is NULL or not terminated), strcmp will read beyond the bounds (or dereference NULL), causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds access.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_ProbeLog(const char *stage, osal_id_t sock_id, const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr, long rc)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1951.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        return; /* Logging is best-effort; do not change program behavior if logging fails */\n    }\n\n    time_t now = time(NULL);\n    fprintf(f, \"%ld: OS_SocketBind stage=%s sock_id=%ld Addr=%p Addr_is_null=%d rc=%ld\\n\",\n            (long)now,\n            stage,\n            (long)sock_id,\n            (void *)Addr,\n            (Addr == NULL) ? 1 : 0,\n            rc);\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_SocketBind(osal_id_t sock_id, const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Log entry and initial arguments */\n    OS_ProbeLog(\"entry\", sock_id, Addr, -1);\n\n    return_code = OS_SocketBindAddress(sock_id, Addr);\n\n    /* Log result of OS_SocketBindAddress */\n    OS_ProbeLog(\"after_bind_address\", sock_id, Addr, (long)return_code);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* About to attempt listen(); record this decision */\n        OS_ProbeLog(\"before_listen_call\", sock_id, Addr, (long)return_code);\n\n        return_code = OS_SocketListen(sock_id);\n\n        /* Log result of OS_SocketListen */\n        OS_ProbeLog(\"after_listen_call\", sock_id, Addr, (long)return_code);\n\n        if (return_code == OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_TYPE)\n        {\n            /* This one is OK, it happens if the socket is a datagram/connectionless\n             * type that does not need to listen().

  "explanation": "The claim is incorrect. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions (memcpy, strcmp/strcpy/etc.) potentially accessing beyond object bounds. The provided OS_SocketBind implementation (both original and the logging-modified version) does not call any string.h string-handling functions \u2014 there is no strcmp, strcpy, memcpy, strlen, etc., in the shown code. Therefore this function as presented cannot violate Rule 21.17.\n\nIf agent A\u2019s scenario refers to a strcmp(TypeName, StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr) that exists in some other function, that is a separate location and must be inspected independently; a potential violation there would be plausible if neither operand is validated for NULL or NUL-termination. But that is not part of the OS_SocketBind code shown here, so the report against OS_SocketBind is not correct.\n\nRecommendation: If the real concern is about a strcmp elsewhere, inspect the function that calls strcmp (or any other string.h function) and ensure pointers are non-NULL and buffers are NUL-terminated or use bounded variants (e.g., strncmp with appropriate lengths) or other defensive checks. Also run static analysis to find all uses of string.h functions for comprehensive coverage."
