  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and related type/macro definitions for any compiler-specific language extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (compiler-specific spellings), typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, zero-length arrays, flexible array members used in a nonstandard way, GNU extension tokens like __builtin_*, or other vendor-specific keywords). The code uses only standard C constructs: typedefs, integer macros, normal function definition and return, simple if statements, and standard comments. No implementation-specific extension tokens or constructs are present in the displayed fragments, so there are no code fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
