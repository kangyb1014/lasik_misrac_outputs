  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages were found in this function. The only pointer in the code is the parameter \"const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr\", which is already const-qualified as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. There are no other pointer variables, no pointer returns, no casts involving pointers, and no pointer arithmetic. The Addr parameter is passed through to helper functions without any local non-const pointer being created. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that need investigation for Rule 8.13 compliance."
