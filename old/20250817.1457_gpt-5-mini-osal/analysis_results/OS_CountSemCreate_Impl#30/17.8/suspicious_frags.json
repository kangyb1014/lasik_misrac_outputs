  "explanation": "No fragments modify any function parameter. Explanation by parameter and statement:\n- token (const OS_object_token_t *token): The code only dereferences *token when calling OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET; the pointer variable token itself is not assigned to or incremented. The const qualifier prevents modification of the pointed-to object through this pointer in this function, and dereferencing/using the pointed value is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the rule allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter, but the pointer itself must not be modified). There are no statements that change token (no assignments like token = ... or token++).\n- sem_initial_value (uint32): This is a pass-by-value parameter and is not assigned to or otherwise modified in the function. It is only read (compared to SEM_VALUE_MAX and passed to sem_init), which does not violate Rule 17.8.\n- options (uint32): This is also pass-by-value and unused; it is not modified.\n- Other operations: impl is a local variable; assigning to it (impl = ...) does not affect any parameter. Passing &impl->id to sem_init and calling sem_init does not modify any of the function's parameter variables.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that should be investigated for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
