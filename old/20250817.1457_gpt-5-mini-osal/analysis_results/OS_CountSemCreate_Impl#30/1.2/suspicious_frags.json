  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The function and related definitions use standard C constructs and POSIX semaphore APIs: typedefs, macros, array declaration, pointer dereference, address-of, and a static inline function (standard C). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, inline assembler, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, nested functions, __extension__, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, or other vendor-specific keywords. The POSIX types/functions (sem_t, sem_init, SEM_VALUE_MAX) are standard OS API usage rather than compiler language extensions, so they do not trigger MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2. Therefore no fragments need investigation for language-extension use."
