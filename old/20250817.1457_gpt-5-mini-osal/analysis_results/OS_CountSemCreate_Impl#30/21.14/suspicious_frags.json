  "explanation": "No use of memcmp or any other string-comparison functions appears in the visible code. The function only performs an integer range check (sem_initial_value > SEM_VALUE_MAX), calls sem_init, and returns status codes; none of these involve comparing null-terminated strings. The only item that could hide a memcmp is the macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...). Its expansion is not shown in this fragment, so that macro call should be investigated (hence included above). All other lines in the function do not involve string operations or comparisons of null-terminated strings and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.14."
