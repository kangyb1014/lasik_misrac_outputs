  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the provided snippets show observable behaviour or side effects and therefore are not candidates for dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2: - The call to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) and the subsequent use of impl (impl->id) is consumed by the semaphore initialization call; removing that would change program behaviour. - The sem_initial_value check and the sem_init(...) call both affect control flow and runtime state (they return different error codes and sem_init modifies the OS semaphore object), so they are not dead. - The return statements and the error code macros are used by callers (OS_CountSemCreate calls OS_CountSemCreate_Impl and propagates its return value), so those branches are meaningful. - The OS_CountSemCreate wrapper routines (ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_OBJECT_INIT, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew) perform allocation/initialization/finalization steps that have side effects (locking, name storage, unlocking) and cannot be removed without changing behaviour. Therefore these fragments do not need further investigation for dead code."
