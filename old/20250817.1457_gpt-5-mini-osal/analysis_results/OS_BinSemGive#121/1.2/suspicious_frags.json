  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragments. The code uses standard C types (typedefs of int32_t/uint32_t), standard pointer and const usage, ordinary function calls, and POSIX pthread APIs (library calls, not language extensions). There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific language extensions such as __attribute__ or __asm__, GCC/Clang typeof or statement-expressions, nested functions, variable-length array extensions, C++ features, or other vendor-specific keywords/pragmas in the shown code. The only macro invocation present (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) is not defined in the provided snippets; its use here is a normal macro call and cannot be classified as a language extension without seeing its definition, so it is not flagged."
