  "explanation": "I examined all functions and their parameters in the provided code. No function parameter identifier is assigned to or otherwise re-bound inside any function (which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8). Specifically:\n\n- OS_BinSemGive(osal_id_t sem_id): sem_id is passed by value and only used as an argument to OS_ObjectIdGetById; it is not assigned to or modified anywhere in the function.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, osal_id_t id, OS_object_token_t *token): lock_mode, idtype and id are passed by value and are not modified. The token parameter is a pointer; the function writes to the object pointed to (token->obj_idx, token->obj_id) which is allowed by the rule (modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted). There are no statements that reassign the token parameter itself (no \"token = ...\"), so the pointer variable is not modified.\n\n- OS_BinSemGive_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token): the parameter is a pointer to const object; the function dereferences it but does not reassign the token pointer. All modifications are to the semaphore record (sem->current_value, pthread calls) and to members of that object \u2014 none of these rebind a function parameter.\n\n- Other calls/macros used (OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex, pthread_cond_signal, pthread_mutex_unlock) operate on either local variables or members of referenced objects; they do not reassign incoming function parameter variables themselves.\n\nBecause no function parameter variable is reassigned or otherwise modified in the provided code, there are no fragments that need investigation for nonconformance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
