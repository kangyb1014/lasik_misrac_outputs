  "explanation": "The variable declarations (OS_object_token_t token; int32 return_code;) and the function signature/comment are not executable statements and therefore cannot themselves be \"unreachable code\" in the sense of MISRA Rule 2.1; they do not need further investigation. The only executable points that could hide unreachable-code issues in this small function are the call to OS_ObjectIdGetById (it might be a macro or function that performs an early return or otherwise affects reachability), the conditional branch that calls OS_BinSemGive_Impl (the condition could be a compile-time constant or the called function could be a macro with control-flow effects), and the final return (to check for any preceding constructs that render it unreachable). No other lines in this function present potential unreachable-code concerns."
