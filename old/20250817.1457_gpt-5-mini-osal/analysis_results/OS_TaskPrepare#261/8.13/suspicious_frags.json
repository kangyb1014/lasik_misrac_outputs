  "explanation": "The fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - The parameter entrypt is used as an output parameter (the function writes through *entrypt and sets it to NULL on error), so its pointed-to type cannot be const here. - The local variable token is passed by address to functions that obtain/release object tokens (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdRelease, etc.); token is intended to be modified and so cannot be const-qualified. - Calls and control-flow statements (return_code checks, OS_TaskMatch_Impl, OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_NotifyEvent) do not introduce additional raw pointers to object data that are only read; they either operate on IDs/tokens or are function calls whose pointer-typed parameters are either NULL literals or are used for output/management. Therefore they are not candidates for making the pointed-to type const under Rule 8.13."
