  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_TaskPrepare code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_TaskPrepare.\n```c\nstatic int32 OS_TaskPrepare(osal_id_t task_id, osal_task_entry *entrypt)\n{\n    int32                      return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t          token;\n    OS_task_internal_record_t *task;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, task_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        task = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_task_table, token);\n\n        return_code = OS_TaskMatch_Impl(&token);\n        *entrypt    = task->entry_function_pointer;\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_TaskRegister_Impl(task_id);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Give event callback to the application */\n        return_code = OS_NotifyEvent(OS_EVENT_TASK_STARTUP, task_id, NULL);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        *entrypt = NULL;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:When OS_TaskPrepare is called from OS_TaskEntryPoint (shown), the caller only uses the entrypt value if OS_TaskPrepare returns OS_SUCCESS. Thus the assignment in the failure path (*entrypt = NULL;) is executed only when return_code != OS_SUCCESS and no caller uses entrypt in that case. Removing that assignment would not change program behaviour in this usage, so the operation is dead code. (If other callers elsewhere relied on entrypt being cleared on failure, then it would not be dead; no such callers are shown.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void os_taskprepare_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2090.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nstatic int32 OS_TaskPrepare(osal_id_t task_id, osal_task_entry *entrypt)\n{\n    int32                      return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t          token;\n    OS_task_internal_record_t *task;\n    bool                       entry_assigned = false;\n\n    os_taskprepare_log(\"OS_TaskPrepare START: task_id=%llu, entrypt_ptr=%p\",\n                       (unsigned long long)(uintptr_t)task_id,\n                       (void *)entrypt);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, task_id, &token);\n    os_taskprepare_log(\"After OS_ObjectIdGetById: return_code=%d, token=%p\",\n                       return_code, (void *)&token);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        task = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_task_table, token);\n\n        return_code = OS_TaskMatch_Impl(&token);\n        os_taskprepare_log(\"After OS_TaskMatch_Impl: return_code=%d, task_ptr=%p\",\n                           return_code, (void *)task);\n\n        /* Log intention to assign entrypt (do not read *entrypt here to avoid UB) */\n        os_taskprepare_log(\"Assigning *entrypt = task->entry_function_pointer (%p)\",\n                           (void *)task->entry_function_pointer);\n\n        *entrypt    = task->entry_function_pointer;\n        entry_assigned = true;\n        os_taskprepare_log(\"Assigned *entrypt -> %p (entry_assigned=%d)\",\n                           (void *)*entrypt, (int)entry_assigned);\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n        os_taskprepare_log(\"Released object token\");\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_TaskRegister_Impl(task_id);\n        os_taskprepare_log(\"After OS_TaskRegister_Impl: return_code=%d\", return_code);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Give event callback to the application */\n        return_code = OS_NotifyEvent(OS_EVENT_TASK_STARTUP, task_id, NULL);\n        os_taskprepare_log(\"After OS_NotifyEvent: return_code=%d\", return_code);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        if (entry_assigned)\n        {\n            os_taskprepare_log(\"Failure path: clearing *entrypt (was %p)\", (void *)*entrypt);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            os_taskprepare_log(\"Failure path: clearing *entrypt but it was not previously assigned (entry_assigned=%d)\", (int)entry_assigned);\n        }\n\n        *entrypt = NULL;\n        os_taskprepare_log(\"*entrypt cleared to NULL\");\n    }\n\n    os_taskprepare_log(\"OS_TaskPrepare END: return_code=%d\", return_code);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_TaskPrepare.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 refers to dead code across the project: an operation is dead only if removing it cannot change program behaviour anywhere. The single caller scenario presented does not prove this. Reasons the assignment *entrypt = NULL; is not demonstrably dead:\n\n- The function assigns *entrypt early (on the nominal path) and then later operations (OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_NotifyEvent) can fail. Clearing *entrypt on the failure path is meaningful to ensure the out-parameter does not remain set after a partial success followed by a failure. Removing the clear would change observable state in that case.\n- Other callers (not shown) might rely on the out-parameter being NULL on failure. Rule 2.2 is evaluated project-wide, so one caller that ignores the out-parameter on failure does not make the assignment dead.\n- Even if no caller currently reads *entrypt on failure, the write could still affect program behaviour (for example, if the pointer location is shared or later inspected), so it cannot be assumed harmless to remove without a full project-wide analysis.\n\nThe provided test code and empty log do not demonstrate the assignment is never executed or that its removal would be behaviour-preserving. Therefore the claim that this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not supported.\n"
