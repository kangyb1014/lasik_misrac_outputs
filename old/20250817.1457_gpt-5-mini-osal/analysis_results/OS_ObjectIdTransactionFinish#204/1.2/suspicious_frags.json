  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no uses of recognized compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof (GCC extension), statement-expressions ({ ... }) as an expression, nested functions, MSVC-specific keywords, or other documented vendor extensions.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED uses a compound literal ((osal_id_t){0xFFFFFFFF}). Compound literals are a standard C99/C11 feature, not a compiler extension, so they do not trigger Rule 1.2 per the requirement to report only documented compiler extensions.\n- All syntax in the function (pointer dereferences, assignments, comparisons, pre-/post-decrement, block comments, function calls) is standard C and not an extension.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that need investigation for violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you expect a different target C standard (for example strictly C89/C90), note that compound literals are not available there; report that requirement and I can re-evaluate accordingly."
