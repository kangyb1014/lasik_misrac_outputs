Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining fragments in the function are not reported because they are clearly necessary for normal control flow or are simple declarations/guards and thus unlikely to be dead code: the function signature and local declaration (OS_common_record_t *record;), the initial guard that returns when token->lock_mode == OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, and the call that obtains the record (record = OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(token);) are all required for the later operations and are executed conditionally in ways that affect behavior. Comments and spacing have no semantic effect. The listed suspicious fragments were chosen because, depending on runtime invariants and lock-state handling elsewhere in the system, they may be executed without affecting observable behavior (and therefore merit investigation for possible dead code)."
