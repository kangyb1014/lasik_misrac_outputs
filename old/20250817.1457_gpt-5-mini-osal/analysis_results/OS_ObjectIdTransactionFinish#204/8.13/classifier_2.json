  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for this call: token is passed as a non-const pointer to OS_Lock_Global and later OS_Unlock_Global(token) and token->lock_mode are modified in the surrounding code. Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to be const-qualified only when the pointed-to object is not modified; here the token is logically mutable for lock/unlock operations. (If, however, OS_Lock_Global were declared to take a non-const pointer but in fact did not modify the object, that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to take a pointer to const.)"
