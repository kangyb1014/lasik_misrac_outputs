  "explanation": "No other fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 because: \n- The function parameter var_id is passed by value and is not assigned to or modified anywhere in this function. There is no statement like \"var_id = ...\" or any other modification of var_id.\n- return_code and token are local variables; assignments to these locals are not subject to Rule 17.8 (which concerns modification of function parameters).\n- Simple return statements and local assignments (e.g., \"return return_code;\" and assignments to return_code) do not involve modifying a function parameter.\nThe only call sites that warrant investigation are the calls that pass &token (listed above), since they supply a pointer argument to other functions; those callees should be checked to ensure they do not modify their pointer parameters themselves (i.e., reassign the pointer parameter), which would violate Rule 17.8. No other code fragments in this function present a potential Rule 17.8 issue."
