  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Reasons:\n- The formal parameters are: timer_id (osal_id_t), start_time (uint32), interval_time (uint32). All three are passed by value.\n- There are no assignments to timer_id, start_time, or interval_time anywhere in the body (no statements of the form \"param = ...\" or using them as lvalues).\n- start_time and interval_time are only used in comparisons (ARGCHECK(...)) and passed by value to OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl(...). They are later copied into timebase->nominal_* fields; copying from a parameter does not modify the parameter itself.\n- timer_id is only passed by value to OS_ObjectIdGetById(...). The address-of operator is used only on the local variable token (&token), not on any function parameter; token and timebase are local variables.\n- Calls that take pointers (e.g., OS_ObjectIdGetById(..., &token), OS_TimeBaseLock_Impl(&token), OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl(&token, ...), OS_TimeBaseUnlock_Impl(&token), OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token)) operate on the local token or on objects derived from it, not on any pointer parameter of OS_TimeBaseSet.\n- The ARGCHECK macro evaluates boolean expressions using the parameters but contains no visible code here that assigns to those parameters; there are no increment/decrement operators applied to the parameters.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
