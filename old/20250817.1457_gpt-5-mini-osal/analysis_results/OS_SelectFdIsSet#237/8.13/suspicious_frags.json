  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Explanation of non-suspicious fragments:\n\n- The function parameter is declared as const OS_FdSet *Set, which satisfies the rule that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible for read-only access.\n- The only other pointer operation in the body is passing &local_id to OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex. That is an output parameter (the function will write into local_id), so it must be a pointer to a non-const osal_index_t and is not expected to be const-qualified.\n- BUGCHECK(Set != NULL, false) only checks the pointer value; it does not require the pointer target to be non-const.\n- Accessing Set->object_ids is done through the const-qualified Set pointer, so the referenced data is treated read-only in this function.\n\nBecause every pointer usage is either already const-qualified for read-only use or intentionally non-const for output, there are no code fragments here that warrant investigation under Rule 8.13."
