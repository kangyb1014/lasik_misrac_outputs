  "explanation": "The rest of the function consists only of local variable declarations, a simple error-path return, and comments which do not perform pointer or array indexing and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 21.17. No calls to <string.h> functions appear in this snippet; the only points that could lead to an out-of-bounds access (and thus warrant inspection against the rule) are the null-check macro, the conversion that produces local_id, and the array access into Set->object_ids. These three fragments are reported above for further examination (e.g. verify BUGCHECK semantics, validate that OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex always produces a local_id within the bounds of object_ids, and confirm the actual size/type of object_ids)."
