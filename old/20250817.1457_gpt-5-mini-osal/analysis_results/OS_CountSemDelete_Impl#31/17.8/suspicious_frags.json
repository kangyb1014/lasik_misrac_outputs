  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function appears to modify the pointer parameter itself (token). Rationale:\n- The parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, so token points to const data; the function only dereferences it (using *token) to read its value \u2014 reading the object referred to is allowed and does not modify the pointer.\n- There is no assignment to token (no statement like token = ...), nor any operation that would change the pointer variable.\n- The macro invocation impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token) uses *token as a value to look up an object. Even if the macro uses the expression, it would not modify the pointer variable itself; modifying the object referred to by the pointer is permitted by the rule.\n- The call sem_destroy(&impl->id) modifies the semaphore object pointed to by impl->id, not the function parameter token; impl is a local pointer variable, and assigning to impl is local state (allowed).\nBecause none of the statements in this function assign to or otherwise alter the pointer parameter, there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
