  "explanation": "No suspicious dead-code fragments found. Reasoning: \n- The function OS_CountSemDelete_Impl performs a table lookup via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and then calls sem_destroy on impl->id; both operations have observable effects and cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. \n- The return path distinguishes success and failure (returns OS_SEM_FAILURE on sem_destroy error, OS_SUCCESS otherwise). The failure branch is observable because the caller (OS_CountSemDelete) passes the return_code to OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete, so removing the failure return would change behaviour. \n- The macros and definitions shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_count_sem_table, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_SEM_FAILURE, OS_SUCCESS, struct and typedefs) are all used by the function; none are unused assignments or unreachable code. \n- There are no obvious unreachable statements, no assignments that are purely initialization-only, and no no-op statements that could be removed without affecting behaviour.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided code and related definitions, there are no code fragments that appear to constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 and no fragments require further investigation for dead-code concerns."
