  "explanation": "I examined the function and related definitions for use of compiler-specific language extensions (examples include __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), labels as values, zero-length arrays, anonymous/unnamed struct/union extensions, compiler builtin types or keywords, or other extensions explicitly documented as compiler extensions). None are present:\n\n- The function uses standard C syntax (return type int32, pointer parameter, local pointer variable).\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an indexed array address using & and [] and calls OS_ObjectIndexFromToken with the address of the token expression; taking the address of an expression like &(*token) is valid standard C and not a compiler extension.\n- The sem_t type and sem_destroy() are POSIX APIs (library features), not compiler language extensions; their usage here is a normal function call, not a language extension.\n- The data declarations (array of records, struct with a sem_t member) and integer macros are standard C constructs.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that employ compiler-documented language extensions that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2; no code fragments need to be investigated for language-extension usage."
