  "explanation": "I examined the provided code fragments: the function OS_CountSemDelete_Impl, the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, the OS_impl_count_sem_table array definition, the OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t struct, the OS_object_token_t typedef, and the inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken implementation. None of these contain any calls to memcmp or any string-handling operations that would imply comparison of null-terminated strings. The only library call present is sem_destroy, which is unrelated to memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If additional files or code (e.g., other modules, macros, or utility libraries) are available, they should be scanned for memcmp usages, but based on the provided snippets there are no suspicious fragments to report."
