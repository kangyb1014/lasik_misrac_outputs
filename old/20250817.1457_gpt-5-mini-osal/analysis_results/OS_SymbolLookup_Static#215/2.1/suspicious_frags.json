  "explanation": "Fragments selected above should be investigated for potential unreachable code because their execution depends on configuration (definition/value of OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE) and runtime return codes. In particular: the entire while loop body in OS_SymbolLookup_Static can be never entered if OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE (OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE) is NULL, making the loop body and its branches effectively unreachable; conversely, if the table is non-NULL but never contains a sentinel entry with Name==NULL or is constructed differently, the Name==NULL branch might be unreachable. The callers' branches that update return_code from the static-lookup result should be checked to ensure the static-lookup path is actually reachable in the intended configurations (i.e., whether OS_SymbolLookup_Impl / OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl ever return non-success, and whether OS_SymbolLookup_Static can ever return OS_SUCCESS), because those assignments could be dead in some builds.\n\nWhy other code fragments were NOT flagged:\n- The strcmp usage and ModuleName NULL-check inside the loop are part of the same loop body and are already included in the selected fragment; they are conditional at runtime and not provably unreachable without knowledge of the static table contents or caller behavior.\n- Simple initializations, macro definitions (#define OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) and the struct/type definitions are not themselves unreachable code; they are compile-time declarations and present no control-flow that could be statically unreachable.\n- The pointer-checking macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER) in the callers were not flagged because they are runtime checks that will be executed when those functions are invoked and are not provably unreachable.\n\nInvestigate the selected fragments with knowledge of how OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE is defined/initialized and the possible return values of the platform-specific lookup implementations to determine whether any branches are in fact unreachable in the integrated project."
