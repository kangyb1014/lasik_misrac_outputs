  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n-

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The call to OS_SymbolLookup_Static updates *symbol_address (a visible side effect) and the conditional assignment return_code = staticsym_status changes the function's returned status to OS_SUCCESS when a static lookup succeeds. Removing the call or the assignment would change observable program behaviour (returned value and/or output parameter), so this is not dead code."
