  "explanation": "I have reported fragments that are the primary likely locations where executed code could be redundant or ineffective depending on configuration: the initial return_code initialization, the static-symbol-table pointer setup, the entire lookup loop (including the end-of-list sentinel handling, the match condition that includes module-name comparison, the assignment to *SymbolAddress), and the caller-side logic that conditionally calls OS_SymbolLookup_Static and then may or may not update the outer return_code. These are the spots where behavior can differ depending on build-time or run-time configuration (e.g. whether OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE is present/populated, whether callers pass ModuleName, or whether the platform implementation always finds symbols), and therefore should be investigated for possible dead operations.\n\nWhy other fragments are not flagged:\n- The pointer checks (OS_CHECK_POINTER(...) in the callers) and the OS_ObjectIdGetById/OS_ObjectIdRelease sequence are essential runtime checks/manipulation and are not candidates for dead code without additional context; they are conditional on caller inputs and object state.\n- The declarations of local variables and the final return statements are standard required scaffolding and are used on at least some control-flow paths shown; they are not evidently redundant.\n- The calls to OS_SymbolLookup_Impl and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl are the primary (platform-specific) lookup paths; they are necessary and their presence does not by itself indicate dead code in the static lookup logic \u2014 instead the interplay between these calls and the static lookup calls (which I flagged) is what needs inspection.\n\nIf more build-time information is available (for example, whether OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE is guaranteed non-NULL/empty or whether OS_*_Impl always succeeds), a more precise determination of executed-but-redundant operations could be made. Based on the supplied source alone, the listed fragments are the appropriate targets for investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
