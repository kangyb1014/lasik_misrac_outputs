The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA C rule about well-formed for loops you must confirm that no for-loop is (a) present directly, (b) injected via a macro/definition, or (c) implied via called functions. The listed symbols are required for that analysis: \n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: This identifier could be a macro or an object. If it is a macro it might expand to code that contains a for loop; inspect its definition to ensure no for-loop is introduced. \n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t: The struct definition is needed to check whether accessing or incrementing StaticSym has any hidden semantics (e.g., if it is an opaque type or a macro alias) and to confirm the nature of its members. \n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t.Name, OS_static_symbol_record_t.Module, OS_static_symbol_record_t.Address: The specific members used in the function must be checked to ensure they are ordinary objects (pointers/arrays/integers) and not macros/functions that could contain loops or side effects. Also to verify that incrementing the StaticSym pointer (++StaticSym) is a simple pointer arithmetic operation on an array of these records. \n\n- strcmp: The function is called inside the loop body. Per the MISRA rule the behaviour of functions called inside a loop must be considered; inspect strcmp (or its replacement/override in this build) to ensure it has no persistent side effects that would violate the rule if this were a for loop body, and to confirm it is a regular function, not a macro expanding to looping code. \n\n- cpuaddr and int32: The typedefs are needed to confirm these are plain integer types (no hidden side effects or special semantics) so that assignments and return types do not mask loop-control behaviour. \n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: The constants are used for return values; verify they are simple macros/enum/integer constants and not macros that expand to code containing loops or side effects. \n\n- NULL: Verify NULL is the usual macro/constant and not redefined to something introducing code with loops or side effects.\n\nIf all of the above are ordinary definitions (no macros that expand to loops or functions with hidden loop-like behavior), then there is no for loop in OS_SymbolLookup_Static and the MISRA rule about well-formed for loops is not applicable/violated. Conversely, if any of these symbols are macros or definitions that introduce for loops or modify loop counters, those definitions must be examined in detail."
