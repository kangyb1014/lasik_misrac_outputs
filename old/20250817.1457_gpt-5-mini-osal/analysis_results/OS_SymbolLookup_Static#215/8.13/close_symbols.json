  "explanation": "- OS_static_symbol_record_t: The struct definition (particularly the types of the members Name, Module, and Address) is required to determine whether those pointer members are already const-qualified. MISRA\u2019s rule hinges on whether StaticSym->Name and StaticSym->Module should be declared as const char * (and whether Address should be a const-qualified pointer type) since the function only reads them.\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: The declaration/definition (type, storage, and const-qualification) of this symbol is needed to know the actual type of StaticSym (e.g., whether it is a pointer-to-const-record, an array of const records, or non-const). This affects whether the local pointer StaticSym should point to a const-qualified type.\n- cpuaddr (typedef): The underlying type of cpuaddr is required because SymbolAddress is a cpuaddr *; if cpuaddr is itself a pointer type or has qualifiers, that changes whether cpuaddr * should be const-qualified and how casting from StaticSym->Address interacts with constness.\n- strcmp (prototype from <string.h>): The parameter types for strcmp (const char *) are relevant to show that passing StaticSym->Name/Module (if non-const char *) to strcmp does not itself require those members to be non-const, and to confirm whether the function only reads the strings (supporting const-qualification).\n\nNote: Other identifiers in the function (int32, OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) do not affect pointer const-qualification and so are not required for the MISRA const-pointer analysis."
