  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the shown code. I inspected the entire function for common vendor extensions such as GCC/Clang attributes or keywords (__attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, and nonstandard storage-class specifiers) and found none. The identifiers like int32, cpuaddr, OS_static_symbol_record_t and OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE are project typedefs/macros (standard C preprocessor and typedef usage, not language extensions) and casts such as (cpuaddr) are standard C. Standard library function strcmp and NULL are used. Pointer arithmetic (++StaticSym), control-flow constructs (while, if, break), and comments are all standard C. If there are concerns about any macros or typedefs introducing compiler-specific extensions (for example if OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE expands to something with __attribute__ or a compiler pragma), that expansion is not shown here \u2014 the present code fragment does not itself contain any explicit language extensions that must be investigated under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
