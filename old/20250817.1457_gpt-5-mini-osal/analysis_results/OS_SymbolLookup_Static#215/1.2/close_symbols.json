  "explanation": "- OS_static_symbol_record_t: Needed to know the exact types of the Name, Module and Address members. In particular, if Address is a function pointer type vs a data pointer/integer, then the cast (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address could rely on a compiler extension (pointer-to-function <-> integer conversions). Also the struct definition might include compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__, packed, flexible-array, zero-length arrays) which would be language extensions.\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: Needed to see how the symbol table is defined/instantiated. It could be a macro or object using compiler-specific extensions (custom section attributes, compound statement expressions, GNU extensions like ({ ... }), or nonstandard linkage) which would violate the MISRA check.\n- cpuaddr: Needed to determine whether this typedef is a plain standard integer type or a compiler-specific type/extension (e.g. defined via __attribute__ or as a nonstandard width) and to check if converting Address to cpuaddr is a standard, defined conversion.\n- int32: Needed to verify this typedef is a standard, portable integer typedef (not a compiler extension or typedef to a compiler-specific intrinsic type).\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: The macros/constants must be inspected to ensure they are plain integer macros/constants and are not implemented via extensions (e.g. using ({ ... }) expressions, typeof, or other compiler-specific constructs).\n- strcmp (prototype): Verify the use of strcmp is the standard library function (normal prototype). If a nonstandard replacement or macro were used, it could hide an extension or nonconforming behavior.\n- NULL (macro): Verify NULL is the standard macro and not redefined as a compiler-specific construct.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any language/compiler extensions are being used in the function (types, casts, macros, or symbol-table definitions)."
