  "explanation": "No other uses of <string.h> functions appear in the provided code, so there are no additional string-handling calls to inspect. The while loop and its sentinel check (StaticSym != NULL and StaticSym->Name == NULL) govern traversal of the static table. The array traversal uses a sentinel terminator pattern and an increment (++StaticSym) which, together with the null-name sentinel, bounds the iteration. Other operations in the function are simple pointer/integer assignments and return-code handling and do not invoke string handling or memory-copy functions, so they do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
