This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) strcmp \u2014 The MISRA rule concerns use of string.h functions; strcmp is the string function used. Its behavior (reads both operand strings until a '\\0' with no bounds checks) is central to deciding if any operand can be read out-of-bounds.\n\n2) OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE \u2014 The function iterates this pointer. To prove safety you must inspect this symbol to ensure it points to a well-formed array/sentinel and that each Name/Module pointer it contains is valid and points to NUL-terminated storage.\n\n3) OS_static_symbol_record_t \u2014 The struct definition (types of Name, Module, Address and any alignment/padding) is required to know how StaticSym->Name and StaticSym->Module are represented (e.g., const char * vs fixed char[]) and whether pointer arithmetic (StaticSym++) is valid.\n\n4) (the static symbol table initializer / entries) \u2014 The actual table contents (how Name and Module are initialized: string literals, char arrays, or computed pointers, and whether a terminating record with Name == NULL exists) are required to determine that strcmp will only be given valid, NUL-terminated strings and that the loop termination sentinel is correct.\n\n5) OS_SymbolLookup \u2014 One of the callers. Inspecting this caller shows how SymbolName (and possibly ModuleName) are obtained/validated before being passed in, e.g., whether they can be NULL, non-NUL-terminated, or point to insufficient storage.\n\n6) OS_ModuleSymbolLookup \u2014 The other caller. Same reason as above: its handling of ModuleName and SymbolName affects whether strcmp operands can be invalid.\n\n7) cpuaddr \u2014 The typedef for cpuaddr is needed to confirm that casting StaticSym->Address to cpuaddr has no bearing on string reads but to ensure the structure layout and types are fully understood when reasoning about memory and alignment.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the two strcmp calls can legally read only within the bounds of the referenced objects (NUL-termination and valid pointers), thereby addressing the MISRA string-bounds rule."
