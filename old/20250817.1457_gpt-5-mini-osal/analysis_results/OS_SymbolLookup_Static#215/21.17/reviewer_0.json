  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct unless there is an external invariant guaranteeing that StaticSym->Module is non-NULL whenever StaticSym->Name is non-NULL and matches SymbolName. In the posted code the conditional is:\n\nif (strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) == 0 && (ModuleName == NULL || strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) == 0))\n\nBecause of C short-circuit semantics, the second subexpression is evaluated only when the first strcmp returns 0. If that happens and ModuleName is non-NULL while StaticSym->Module is NULL, strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) will be called with a NULL pointer, which invokes undefined behavior and constitutes an out-of-bounds (invalid) access for the string library call. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 prohibits such uses of the <string.h> functions. Therefore the reported violation is valid unless the program has a documented, enforced invariant that StaticSym->Module cannot be NULL in the matching case."
