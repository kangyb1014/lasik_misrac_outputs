  "explanation": "The report is correct. The combined condition uses strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) first and then (ModuleName == NULL || strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) == 0). If the name matches and ModuleName is non-NULL, the code will call strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) without any check that StaticSym->Module is a valid, null-terminated string. If StaticSym->Module is NULL this is a NULL-pointer dereference; if it points to a non-terminated buffer strcmp may read past the object bounds. Both situations violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17. The empty runtime log does not refute the static defect \u2014 the code is potentially non-conforming unless there is an externally guaranteed invariant (and that invariant is documented and enforced) that StaticSym->Module is always non-NULL and null-terminated. Recommended fix: guard the strcmp with an explicit check, e.g. replace the subcondition with (ModuleName == NULL || (StaticSym->Module != NULL && strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) == 0)), and ensure all module strings are properly null-terminated (or use bounded comparisons where object sizes are known)."
