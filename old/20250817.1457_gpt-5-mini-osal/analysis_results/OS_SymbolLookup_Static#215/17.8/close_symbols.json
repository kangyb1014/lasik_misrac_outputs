  "explanation": "cpuaddr: Needed to know the type pointed to by the first parameter (cpuaddr *SymbolAddress). This determines whether the expression *SymbolAddress = ... modifies the object referred to (allowed) and confirms that the pointer variable SymbolAddress itself is not being reassigned.\n\nOS_static_symbol_record_t: The struct definition (including the types of the fields Name, Module, and Address) is required to confirm that accesses like StaticSym->Name, StaticSym->Module, and StaticSym->Address are reading struct fields (not aliasing or invoking macros that could modify the function parameters) and to verify the types used in comparisons and the cast to cpuaddr.\n\nOS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: The macro or symbol that initializes StaticSym must be inspected to ensure it does not expand to code that modifies any of the function parameters (e.g., by side effects or aliasing). It also establishes the provenance/type of StaticSym used in the loop.\n\nstrcmp (from <string.h>): The prototype and semantics of strcmp are needed to ensure that calling strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) and strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) do not modify the pointer parameters (they take const char * and should not alter the pointer variables or pointed-to objects per their contract).\n\nNULL macro: Used in comparisons (StaticSym->Name == NULL and ModuleName == NULL). Confirming the definition of NULL ensures the comparisons are standard pointer checks and not some macro with side effects.\n\nOS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: The return-code constants are needed only to understand control flow/return paths (not to detect pointer modification), but their definitions complete the semantic view of the function (ensuring no hidden macros or side effects that could alter parameters)."
