  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The only write involving a parameter is '*SymbolAddress = ...' which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter (permitted by Rule 17.8); the pointer variable SymbolAddress itself is not reassigned. The other parameters (SymbolName, ModuleName) are only read (compared via strcmp and checked for NULL) and are not modified. The increment '++StaticSym' modifies a local pointer, not a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
