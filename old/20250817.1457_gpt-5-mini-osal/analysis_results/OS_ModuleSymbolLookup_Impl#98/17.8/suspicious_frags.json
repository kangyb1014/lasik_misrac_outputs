  "explanation": "No parameter is modified in the provided function body. Details:\n- The token parameter is only dereferenced in impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token); this reads the object referred to by token; it does not modify the token pointer or the object (the parameter type is const OS_object_token_t *). There is no assignment to token or any operation like token++ or token = ... in the code.\n- SymbolAddress is passed as an argument to OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(impl->dl_handle, SymbolAddress, SymbolName); the pointer itself is not assigned to or changed in this function. Modifying the object pointed to by SymbolAddress via the call is allowed by the rule and does not violate Rule 17.8; the current function does not change the pointer variable.\n- SymbolName is declared const char * and is only passed through; it is not modified.\n- There are no assignments to any parameter (no writes to token, SymbolAddress, or SymbolName) and no pointer arithmetic or reassignment involving the parameters.\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for potential violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
