  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided function OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl and all related code and macros in the additional code. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 targets use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). None of the following inspected fragments call any of those functions:\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl (calls OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl)\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (indexing and pointer arithmetic only)\n- OS_impl_module_table declaration and OS_impl_module_internal_record_t (data definitions)\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl (uses dlerror, dlsym and OS_DEBUG; no <string.h> functions)\n- Assignment of *SymbolAddress and return handling\n\nThe only uses of string-like data are passing SymbolName to dlsym and to OS_DEBUG (format output). These are not calls to functions from <string.h>, so they do not fall under Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.17 in the provided code."
