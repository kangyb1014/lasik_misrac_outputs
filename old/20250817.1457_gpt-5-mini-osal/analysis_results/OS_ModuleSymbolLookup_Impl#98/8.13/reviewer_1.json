The assignment 'Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);' therefore uses a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer is possible, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl_LogProbe(const OS_object_token_t *token,\n                                                OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl,\n                                                cpuaddr *SymbolAddress,\n                                                const char *SymbolName,\n                                                int32 status)\n{\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/787.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (fp == NULL)\n    {\n        /* Fallback if the logs directory does not exist. */\n        fp = fopen(\"/tmp/787.txt\", \"a\");\n    }\n\n    if (fp == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging is not possible, silently continue to preserve original behavior. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Log pointers and values that help reproduce the scenario.\n       - token pointer and token value (dereferenced) so callers can see which object was used\n       - impl pointer and its dl_handle value (if available) to show the handle passed to dlsym\n       - SymbolName to show the symbol being looked up\n       - SymbolAddress pointer and resulting value (after lookup)\n       - status returned by the generic lookup implementation\n    */\n    unsigned long token_val = 0UL;\n\n    /* Attempt to capture the token value, matching the original use of *token in the code.\n       The token type may be an aggregate (struct/union).

  "explanation": "The reported violation is not supported by the provided code. The OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl shown does not declare any local variable named 'Function' (or a non-const void* used only for reading). The function parameters are already const where appropriate (token and SymbolName). SymbolAddress is an output parameter and must be a non-const cpuaddr* so it is correct as non-const. The local 'impl' pointer could in theory be declared as a pointer-to-const if the implementation permits, but agent A's scenario about a void *Function and dlsym appears to refer to different/other code (e.g. inside OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl), not the snippet shown. Therefore the specific claim that this OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is incorrect."
