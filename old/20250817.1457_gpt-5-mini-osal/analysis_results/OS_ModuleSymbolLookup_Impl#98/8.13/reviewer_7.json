The pointed-to object is not modified through this pointer, so it can and should be declared as \"const void *Function;\" to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Log(const OS_object_token_t *token,\n                                      const OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl,\n                                      const char *SymbolName,\n                                      const cpuaddr *SymbolAddress,\n                                      int32 status,\n                                      int print_value)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/787.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"--- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl log ---\\n\");\n    fprintf(f, \" token ptr = %p\\n\", (const void *)token);\n    fprintf(f, \" impl ptr  = %p\\n\", (const void *)impl);\n\n    if (impl != NULL)\n    {\n        /* impl->dl_handle is observed but not modified */\n        fprintf(f, \" impl->dl_handle = %p\\n\", (const void *)impl->dl_handle);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \" impl is NULL\\n\");\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \" SymbolName = %s\\n\", (SymbolName != NULL) ?

  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the code shown. The OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl function\u2019s parameters token and SymbolName are already const; SymbolAddress is an output parameter and therefore must be a non-const cpuaddr * so it can be written to. The only local pointer in the snippet that is non-const is impl, but in this function impl is only read and could be declared as const if the surrounding APIs/macros permit \u2014 that would be an optional tightening, not the concrete violation that Agent A describes. Agent A\u2019s narrative actually points at a different function (OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl) where a local variable void *Function is used only to hold the result of dlsym() and then converted to an integer; that is outside the provided OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl snippet. If the described behavior in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl is accurate, then changing the local variable to const void *Function would satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in that function. But for the code you supplied, there is no clear MISRA 8.13 violation \u2014 the reported problem refers to another function and so the report is incorrect."
