  "explanation": "I selected fragments where pointer types are not const-qualified but could plausibly be made to point to const-qualified types (and thus should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13). Other fragments in the provided code do not need investigation for this rule because: (1) parameters that are already const-qualified (e.g. the input token parameter and SymbolName) are correct; (2) output parameters (SymbolAddress) must remain non-const because the function stores a result through them; (3) some pointers are passed to or come from external APIs (dlsym/dlhandle) that require non-const types, so the API contract may prevent adding const there; and (4) local scalar/enum/integer types and other non-pointer constructs are irrelevant to this pointer-const rule. The listed fragments cover places where the pointer constness is ambiguous or could be tightened (object-table access, table declaration/type, module handle field, the generic lookup signature and its local pointer), so they merit inspection. No other pointer-containing lines in the supplied code appear to be candidates for applying const qualification under Rule 8.13."
