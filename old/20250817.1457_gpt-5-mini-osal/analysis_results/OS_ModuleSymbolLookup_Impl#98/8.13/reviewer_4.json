  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 8.13.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32                             status;\n    OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_module_table, *token);\n\n    status = OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(impl->dl_handle, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The local variable 'impl' is declared as a non-const pointer (OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl) but is only used for read access (impl->dl_handle is only read). It could be declared as const OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...). Therefore a pointer points to a non-const-qualified type when a const-qualified type is possible.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl_Log(const OS_object_token_t *token,\n                                           OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl,\n                                           const char *SymbolName,\n                                           int32 stage, /* 0=before lookup, 1=after lookup */\n                                           int32 status)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/787.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f) return;\n\n    if (stage == 0)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"[ModuleSymbolLookup] ENTRY\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"[ModuleSymbolLookup] EXIT\\n\");\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"  token_ptr = %p\\n\", (const void *)token);\n    fprintf(f, \"  impl_ptr   = %p\\n\", (void *)impl);\n\n    if (impl != NULL)\n    {\n        /* impl->dl_handle is observed as used by the implementation.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Correct. In OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl the local variable \"impl\" is only used for read access (only impl->dl_handle is read), so it could and should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (e.g. const OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl) to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET to a const-qualified pointer is allowed; reading a member from a const-qualified object is allowed. The provided logging/test code does not change this fact (the empty log is an execution/coverage issue, not a counterargument). The only reason not to make it const would be if the function needed to modify the pointed-to object or needed to pass the pointer to an API that requires a non-const pointer; neither occurs here. Therefore the report is correct."
