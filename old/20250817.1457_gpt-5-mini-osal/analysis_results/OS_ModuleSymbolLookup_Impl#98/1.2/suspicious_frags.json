  "explanation": "I examined the provided code and related definitions for constructs that are explicitly documented compiler language extensions. None of the code uses compiler-specific extensions as described in typical compiler documentation. Specific notes: \n\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro: standard preprocessor macro usage and array indexing. The invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_module_table, *token) expands to use the address of the de-referenced token; this is standard C macro/operand behavior, not a compiler extension.\n\n- extern OS_impl_module_table declaration and the struct OS_impl_module_internal_record_t: ordinary declarations; the comment /* cppcheck-suppress unusedStructMember */ is a static-analysis annotation in a comment, not a compiler extension.\n\n- typedefs using stdint types (uintptr_t, int32_t) and use of int32, cpuaddr: standard C typedefs from C99/stdint, not compiler extensions.\n\n- static inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(...): use of inline (with static) is standard since C99 and not a compiler extension.\n\n- Use of POSIX dynamic-loading functions (dlsym, dlerror) and casting a void* to an integer type (cpuaddr/uintptr_t): these are library/API usage and an implementation-defined pointer-to-integer conversion, but they are not compiler language extensions. (Pointer-to-integer conversion/representation is implementation-defined behavior, but that is not the same as using a compiler extension as required by Rule 1.2.)\n\n- OS_DEBUG usage and any variadic-macro-like behavior are not shown to be compiler-specific extensions in the provided code.\n\nTherefore, there are no code fragments that should be reported for possible use of compiler language extensions under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
