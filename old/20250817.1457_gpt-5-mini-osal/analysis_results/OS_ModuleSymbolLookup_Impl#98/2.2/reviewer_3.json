  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32                             status;\n    OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_module_table, *token);\n\n    status = OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(impl->dl_handle, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:If the OS_DEBUG macro is defined as a no-op (e.g. expands to nothing or ((void)0)) in the build used in the project, the logging call OS_DEBUG(\"Error: %s: %s\\n\", SymbolName, dlError); performs no observable action. Removing that statement would not change program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, however, OS_DEBUG actually performs logging or other observable side-effects in the built configuration, then the call is not dead and there is no violation.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_ProbeLog(const char *phase,\n                                          const OS_object_token_t *token,\n                                          OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl,\n                                          cpuaddr *SymbolAddress,\n                                          const char *SymbolName,\n                                          int32 status)\n{\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/786.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (fp == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging cannot be performed, do not affect functional behaviour. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Timestamp for ordering events. */\n    time_t t = time(NULL);\n    char timestr[32] = \"\";\n    if (t != (time_t)(-1))\n    {\n        struct tm tmv;\n        if (localtime_r(&t, &tmv) != NULL)\n        {\n            (void)strftime(timestr, sizeof(timestr), \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", &tmv);\n        }\n    }\n\n    fprintf(fp, \"[%s] OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl %s: token_ptr=%p impl_ptr=%p SymbolName=\\\"%s\\\" SymbolAddress_ptr=%p\",\n            timestr[0] ? timestr : \"(no-time)\",\n            phase,\n            (const void *)token,\n            (const void *)impl,\n            (SymbolName != NULL) ?

  "explanation": "The claim is not supported by the supplied OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl code. The function shown simply retrieves an implementation record, calls OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, and returns its result \u2014 there is no OS_DEBUG or other logging statement in this function to be \u201cdead\u201d. Whether a logging call that expands to a no-op constitutes dead code is a separate (and valid) concern, but it would be a problem in the function that contains that logging call (e.g. inside OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl), not in OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl as presented. The agent\u2019s scenario is speculative (it assumes a logging call exists in the shown function) and therefore does not establish a Rule 2.2 violation for this function. Consequently the report is not correct for the provided code snippet."
