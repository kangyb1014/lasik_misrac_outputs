  "explanation": "The fragments above are the places that can produce code paths that are potentially unreachable or are involved in control-flow/expressions that could hide unreachable code and therefore require investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Specifically: the macro definition together with its use (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and its invocation) should be checked because the macro takes the address of its 'tok' parameter (&(tok)) while the call site passes an expression (*token) \u2014 this combination can affect whether the resulting indexing and access can actually be reached or may be ill-formed in some contexts. The inline index extractor (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) is included because it is used by the macro and a NULL or invalid token could make code paths unreachable or undefined. In OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl the three-way if/else (dlError / Function == NULL / success) contains branches whose reachability depends on the behavior of the dynamic loader (dlerror/dlsym) on the target platform; the middle branch (Function == NULL) is explicitly noted in the comment as sometimes redundant on some implementations and therefore should be reviewed for actual reachability. The assignment '*SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function;' is flagged because it is executed regardless of whether Function is NULL \u2014 this is relevant to control flow and may hide an unreachable or unintended state. Other code fragments (type/struct definitions, variable declarations, the simple return statements, and the initial status assignment) do not introduce unreachable code by themselves and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 in this context."
