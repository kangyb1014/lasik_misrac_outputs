  "explanation": "I did not find any uses of compiler-specific language extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (for example: __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, asm/inline assembly, GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), nonstandard pragmas, or other vendor-specific keywords). The constructs present are standard C (C99/C11) features: use of bool/true (stdbool.h), 'inline' functions, and a compound literal in the macro OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED ((osal_id_t){0xFFFFFFFF}) \u2014 all of which are standard C rather than compiler extensions. There are no occurrences of reserved extension identifiers or implementation-specific constructs that would trigger Rule 1.2 reporting, so no code fragments need further investigation for language extensions."
