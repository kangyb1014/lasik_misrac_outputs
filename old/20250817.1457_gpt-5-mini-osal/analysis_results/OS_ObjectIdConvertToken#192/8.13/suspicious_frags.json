  "explanation": "The only pointer parameter in this function is 'token'. The flagged fragments cover the function signature and every use-site where a non-const pointer to the token is passed or its fields are read. These are the locations that need investigation to determine whether the token pointer (or the parameter types of the called functions) could be const-qualified per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Other pointer usages in this function do not need investigation: 'obj' is an OS_common_record_t * that is written to (obj->active_id and obj->refcount are modified), so it must remain a non-const target; there are no other pointer variables declared here. Scalars such as expected_id, attempts, and return_code are non-pointer types. Calls that operate on IDs use value types (osal_id_t) rather than pointers. Therefore no additional fragments in this function are candidates for const-qualification under Rule 8.13."
