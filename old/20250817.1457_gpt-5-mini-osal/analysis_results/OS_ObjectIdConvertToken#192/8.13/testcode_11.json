  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe function parameter 'OS_object_token_t *token' is only read in OS_ObjectIdConvertToken (e.g. token->lock_mode is tested, token passed to OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken/OS_ObjectIdFromToken/OS_WaitForStateChange/OS_Unlock_Global) and is not modified locally. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should be const-qualified when possible \u2014 the signature should be 'const OS_object_token_t *token' and the read-only usage (including the 'if (token->lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)') should use that const-qualified pointer. Because the parameter is non-const but used only for read access, this violates Rule 8.13.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_ObjectIdConvertToken code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1539.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_ObjectIdConvertToken as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ObjectIdConvertToken:\n```c\nint32 OS_ObjectIdConvertToken(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32               return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    uint32              attempts    = 0;\n    OS_common_record_t *obj;\n    osal_id_t           expected_id;\n\n    obj         = OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(token);\n    expected_id = OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token);\n\n    /*\n     * Upon entry the ID from the token must be valid\n     */\n    if (!OS_ObjectIdIsValid(expected_id))\n    {\n        return OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If lock mode is RESERVED, then the ID in the record should\n     * already be set to OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED.
