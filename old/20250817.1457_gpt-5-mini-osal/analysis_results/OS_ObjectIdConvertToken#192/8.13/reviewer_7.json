  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. In the body of OS_ObjectIdConvertToken the parameter token is only read (token->lock_mode, passed to OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_WaitForStateChange, OS_Unlock_Global, etc.) and there is no direct modification of *token. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer parameter should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so the parameter should be declared as const OS_object_token_t *token.\n\nThe only caveat is if one of the called functions (OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_WaitForStateChange, OS_Unlock_Global) legitimately modifies the token or their prototypes require a non-const pointer. If so, the parameter cannot be made const without changing those APIs. If those functions only observe token, their prototypes should also be updated to take const pointers and OS_ObjectIdConvertToken should be changed accordingly. If changing the APIs is not possible, a documented MISRA deviation is required.\n\nThe provided test instrumentation and empty log do not contradict this analysis \u2014 they only show the function may not have been executed during the test run."
