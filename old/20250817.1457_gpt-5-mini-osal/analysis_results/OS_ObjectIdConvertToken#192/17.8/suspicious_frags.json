  "explanation": "I inspected OS_ObjectIdConvertToken and the related helper functions provided. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 restriction concerns modifying a function parameter itself (i.e., reassigning the pointer variable), whereas modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted. In the target function there are no direct assignments to the parameter variable token (no token = ..., no token++, no pointer arithmetic on token). All uses are of the form token->field, which modifies the object pointed to (allowed by the rule). The helper functions called were also checked: OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken takes a const pointer and does not modify token; OS_ObjectIdFromToken only reads token; OS_WaitForStateChange does not reassign the token pointer (it manipulates objtype->owner_key and calls the impl wait); OS_Unlock_Global modifies token->lock_key (this modifies the object pointed to, which is allowed by Rule 17.8) but does not reassign the token pointer itself. Therefore there are no code fragments that appear to violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs further investigation under that rule."
