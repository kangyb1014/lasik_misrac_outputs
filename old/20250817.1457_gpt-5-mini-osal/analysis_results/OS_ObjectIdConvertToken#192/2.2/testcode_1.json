  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe initialization int32 return_code = OS_ERROR; is dead code. The variable is either returned directly via an early return (OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE) before use, or is always assigned inside the while(true) loop (set to OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERR_INVALID_ID, or OS_ERR_OBJECT_IN_USE) before being inspected/used after the loop. Removing the initial assignment to OS_ERROR would not change program behaviour, so this executed assignment violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_ObjectIdConvertToken code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1538.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_ObjectIdConvertToken as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ObjectIdConvertToken:\n```c\nint32 OS_ObjectIdConvertToken(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32               return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    uint32              attempts    = 0;\n    OS_common_record_t *obj;\n    osal_id_t           expected_id;\n\n    obj         = OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(token);\n    expected_id = OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token);\n\n    /*\n     * Upon entry the ID from the token must be valid\n     */\n    if (!OS_ObjectIdIsValid(expected_id))\n    {\n        return OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If lock mode is RESERVED, then the ID in the record should\n     * already be set to OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED.
