For msecs < 0 the code uses tvptr = NULL; for msecs == 0 the code sets tv explicitly to zero; only the msecs > 0 path uses ts_end.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead (redundant) code \u2014 operations that execute but whose removal would not change program behaviour. However, the OS_GenericWrite_Impl source shown does not contain any reference to ts_end or a memset(&ts_end, 0, sizeof(ts_end)). The reported symptom (a memset executed in the msecs <= 0 branch that is never used) therefore cannot apply to the provided OS_GenericWrite_Impl implementation; the agent A appears to have confused this function with another routine (likely the select/timeout helper such as OS_SelectSingle_Impl) that handles timespec/tv fields. Because the asserted memset/ts_end sequence is not present in the target code, the claim that OS_GenericWrite_Impl violates MISRA Rule 2.2 is not supported by the provided source. (If there were such a memset in a different function, one would need to inspect the full control/data flow for that function to determine whether removing it changes behaviour \u2014 only then could it be declared dead code.) Also note the empty test log simply indicates the function was probably not exercised by the test harness, not that there is a Rule 2.2 violation in this code."
