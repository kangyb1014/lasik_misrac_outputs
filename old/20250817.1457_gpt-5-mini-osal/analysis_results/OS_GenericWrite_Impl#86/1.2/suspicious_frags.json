  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n\n- There are no gcc/clang/MSVC extension tokens or builtins such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __extension__, __typeof__, __asm, __label__, or other double-underscore compiler intrinsics.\n- There are no statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, no nested functions, and no inline assembly blocks.\n- The macros used (GENERIC_IO_CONST_DATA_CAST, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_DEBUG) are ordinary macros. GENERIC_IO_CONST_DATA_CAST is defined empty here; even if on some platforms it were defined to a plain cast (e.g. (void *)), that would be standard C casting, not a compiler language extension. OS_DEBUG uses a C99 variadic macro which is standard since C99, not a compiler extension.\n- Types and identifiers such as ssize_t, fd_set, FD_SET, select(), write(), strerror(), errno are POSIX/system APIs or types (library/platform interfaces), not compiler language extensions. MISRA Rule 1.2 concerns compiler language extensions; library or OS APIs are outside that specific prohibition.\n- Standard C constructs only are used (typedefs for fixed-width integers, pointer usage, macro expansion, function calls, bitwise operations). No token-pasting or other preprocessor tricks that would rely on nonstandard behavior are present.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language/compiler extensions)."
