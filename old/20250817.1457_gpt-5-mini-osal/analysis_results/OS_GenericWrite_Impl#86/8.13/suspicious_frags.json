  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that should be const-qualified where possible. The fragments above either declare or use pointers/objects that could involve const qualification or involve a cast that may remove const. The rest of the code in the function (checks on nbytes, setting operation, selectable boolean test, errno handling, assigning/os_result checks, and the final return) do not introduce additional pointer-to-object usages that would affect const qualification and therefore do not need investigation for this rule. In particular, the parameter 'const void *buffer' itself is already const-qualified (the only place it could lose constness is the write() call or any explicit cast via GENERIC_IO_CONST_DATA_CAST), and other local scalar variables (return_code, os_result, operation, timeout, nbytes) are non-pointer types and not relevant to Rule 8.13. The selected fragments are the likely points where const qualification might be lost or should be enforced and therefore should be examined."
