  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. In OS_GenericWrite_Impl the local pointer impl is only used for read access (impl->selectable and impl->fd) and is never used to modify the underlying record. Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (\u201cA pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d), impl could and should be declared as const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl; to reflect its read-only usage. Changing the declaration to a pointer-to-const is allowed (assigning a non-const pointer to a const-qualified pointer is permitted) and would not affect the subsequent read-only uses or the call to write, so the current code does not follow the rule's guidance."
