It could and should be declared as const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl to preserve constness. Therefore the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (Additionally, the macro call uses *token (token is const OS_object_token_t *); if the macros or functions it expands to/uses accept non-const pointers this would further drop const-qualification and also breach Rule 8.13.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log_fmt(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    int saved_errno = errno;\n    (void)mkdir(\"/tmp/logs\", 0777); /* ignore error if exists */\n\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/691.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        va_list ap;\n        va_start(ap, fmt);\n        vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n        va_end(ap);\n        fflush(f);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n\n    errno = saved_errno;\n}\n\nint32 OS_GenericWrite_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const void *buffer, size_t nbytes, int32 timeout)\n{\n    int32                           return_code;\n    ssize_t                         os_result;\n    uint32                          operation;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    probe_log_fmt(\"ENTER OS_GenericWrite_Impl: token=%p, buffer=%p, nbytes=%zu, timeout=%d\\n\",\n                  (const void *)token, buffer, nbytes, timeout);\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);\n\n    probe_log_fmt(\"After OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET: impl=%p\\n\", (void *)impl);\n\n    return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n\n    if (nbytes > 0)\n    {\n        operation = OS_STREAM_STATE_WRITABLE;\n\n        probe_log_fmt(\"nbytes>0: initial operation=0x%08x\\n\", (unsigned)operation);\n\n        /*\n         * If filehandle is set with O_NONBLOCK, then must call select() here.\n         *\n         * The \"selectable\" field should be set false for those file handles\n         * which the underlying OS does not support select() on.\n         *\n         * Note that a timeout will not work unless selectable is true.\n         */\n        probe_log_fmt(\"impl->selectable=%d\\n\", (impl != NULL) ?

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The core of agent A\u2019s report is correct. In OS_GenericWrite_Impl the local variable impl is only used for read-only accesses (impl->selectable, impl->fd) and is never used to modify the object it points to. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advises that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, so declaring impl as\n\n    const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\nwould be the preferred form and would satisfy the rule.\n\nA few supporting points and caveats:\n- Assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) (which likely yields a pointer to a non-const record) to a pointer-to-const is allowed; it does not violate const-correctness (converting T * to const T * is permitted). So changing the local declaration to const is safe from the assignment standpoint.\n- The additional suggestion in agent A that the *token usage or macro expansion might \u201cdrop const-qualification\u201d is unlikely to be relevant here: dropping const qualification would require an assignment from const-qualified to non-const-qualified, which is not what the code does. If any downstream function or macro actually requires a modifiable pointer to the file record, that would be a reason not to make impl const; however nothing in this function does such modification.\n- If the project coding style or other API constraints require impl to be non-const (for example to pass it to other callers that expect a non-const pointer), that would be a legitimate reason not to change it \u2014 but that is an external constraint, not a justification that the current code conforms to Rule 8.13.\n\nConclusion: The reported violation is correct \u2014 the function should declare impl as a pointer to a const-qualified record unless there is a project-specific reason that prevents it."
