  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. Specific reasoning per parameter:\n- token: Only dereferenced (*token) and passed to OS_SelectSingle_Impl(token,...). Neither operation modifies the pointer parameter itself. The assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) uses the value pointed to but does not change token.\n- buffer: Only used as an argument to write() with a cast (GENERIC_IO_CONST_DATA_CAST buffer). A cast does not modify the parameter variable; it only changes the type for the call. There is no pointer arithmetic or assignment to buffer.\n- nbytes: Only read (compared and passed to write()); it is not assigned or otherwise changed.\n- timeout: Only passed by value to OS_SelectSingle_Impl; it is not modified.\n\nAll uses either read the parameters, dereference them, cast them for a call, or pass them to other functions. None reassign or alter the pointer variables themselves, so there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this code."
