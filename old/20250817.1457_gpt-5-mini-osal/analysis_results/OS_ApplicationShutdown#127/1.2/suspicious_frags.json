  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The constructs present are standard C and/or standard library/POSIX APIs: typedefs (uint8_t alias), standard integer literal (hex constant), designated initializers for the global struct (C99/C11 standard), preprocessor conditionals, boolean macros/identifiers (true/false \u2014 typically from stdbool.h or a project definition), and calls to POSIX library functions (kill, getpid, SIGHUP) which are library/system interfaces, not compiler language extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler extension tokens or features (for example: __attribute__, __asm, typeof, _Pragma with compiler-specific args, nonstandard keywords, GNU statement-expressions, nested functions, or other vendor-specific builtins). Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If you expect any project-specific macros (e.g. true/false) to be compiler-provided extensions, provide the compiler documentation or headers so I can re-evaluate those symbols."
