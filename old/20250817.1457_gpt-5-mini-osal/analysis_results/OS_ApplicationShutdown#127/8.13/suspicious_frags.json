  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not involve pointer declarations or pointer targets and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Specifically:\n- The function OS_ApplicationShutdown(uint8 flag) takes a scalar uint8 parameter (no pointer).\n- The assignment OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState = OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER involves integer types, not pointers.\n- OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER is an integer macro constant.\n- The implementation OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl(void) calls kill(getpid(), SIGHUP) where getpid() returns a pid_t and SIGHUP is an integer signal constant; there are no pointer arguments or pointer targets in that fragment.\n- The typedef uint8_t uint8 is a scalar type alias, not a pointer.\nGiven the provided code, the only location that references a pointer-like member is the .EventHandler = NULL initializer inside the OS_SharedGlobalVars definition; that member should be investigated to determine whether its pointed-to type should be const-qualified. No other fragments require investigation for Rule 8.13 based on the supplied code."
