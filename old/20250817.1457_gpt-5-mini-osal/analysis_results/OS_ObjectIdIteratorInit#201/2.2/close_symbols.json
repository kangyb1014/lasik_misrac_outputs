  "explanation": "For deciding whether any of the operations in OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit are dead (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_object_iter_t (definition): The function writes multiple fields of *iter (match, arg, limit, base, token address passed). The exact struct definition (field names, types and order) is required to know which fields are actually being set, which are later read by other code, and the token field type/offset used by OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit.\n\n- OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t (typedef): To know whether assigning the match function pointer has any special semantics or side-effects (normally none) and to match uses of that field in other code.\n\n- osal_objtype_t (typedef/enum): Needed to understand valid ranges/values passed to OS_GetMaxForObjectType/OS_GetBaseForObjectType and whether those calls are meaningful for the given objtype values (and to detect any degenerate cases making the assignments pointless).\n\n- OS_GetMaxForObjectType: The return value is stored into iter->limit. To determine if that assignment is dead, the analyzer must know whether this function has side-effects and what values it can return (e.g. constant, range) and whether those values are used later.\n\n- OS_GetBaseForObjectType: Its return is used to compute &OS_common_table[...], stored into iter->base. The analyzer must know what it returns and if it has side-effects (and whether the computed base pointer is meaningful to later code).\n\n- OS_common_table (declaration/type): The base assignment uses this global. Its type, element type and layout are required to determine whether &OS_common_table[index] is a meaningful pointer, and whether assigning it is required for later behavior.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit: The function call is the return value of OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit and takes &iter->token. To tell whether earlier assignments to iter fields are dead one must know what OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit reads or modifies (does it depend only on token, does it also read other iter fields, or does it overwrite them?). Also need to know if it has side-effects that make other assignments irrelevant.\n\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL (macro/enum): Its value or semantic meaning may affect the behavior of OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit; include to allow full analysis of that call.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: One of the common follow-up operations on the iterator. To determine if setting fields in the init is necessary, the analyzer must inspect destroy to see which iterator fields it reads/uses (to detect if any initializations are unused).\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry: Another consumer of the iterator in typical iteration flows; needed to see which iterator fields are read during iteration.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: A caller/consumer of the iterator (and part of iterator usage paths). Including this helps determine whether fields set here are actually used by the iterator consumer(s).\n\n- OS_ForEachObjectOfType: Higher-level caller that uses the iterator; needed to examine full usage paths to determine whether any of the assignments in the init are ever read (and therefore whether they are dead).\n\nIncluding these symbols lets the next analyst trace uses of iter after initialization, check side-effects of the called helper routines, and determine whether any assignment or call in OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit can be removed without affecting program behaviour (the MISRA dead code criterion)."
