  "explanation": "No code fragment in OS_PthreadTaskEntry modifies the function parameter 'arg'. The parameter is only read and its value is copied into local_arg.opaque_arg (a local union member) \u2014 copying the pointer does not modify the parameter itself. There are no assignments to 'arg' and no operations that change the pointer value. The subsequent call OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id) uses the union's integer member derived from the copied pointer value; that does not modify the parameter either. Therefore, there are no violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code fragment."
