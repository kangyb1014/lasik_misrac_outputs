  "explanation": "- OS_TaskEntryPoint: The target calls this function and the comment claims it \"Never returns\". To decide if the subsequent \"return NULL;\" is unreachable we must inspect OS_TaskEntryPoint implementation and its attributes (e.g. noreturn) to confirm it does not return to the caller.\\n- OS_TaskPrepare: It is a direct callee of OS_TaskEntryPoint (per the call graph). OS_TaskEntryPoint may perform setup and then return; therefore OS_TaskPrepare must be examined to see whether control flow ultimately returns to OS_PthreadTaskEntry or transfers to a non-returning path.\\n- OS_TaskExit: Also a direct callee of OS_TaskEntryPoint and likely responsible for terminating the thread (e.g. calling pthread_exit/exit). Determining whether OS_TaskExit is non-returning is essential to determine if the code after the call in OS_PthreadTaskEntry is unreachable.\\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The local union/type used to pass the argument (opaque_arg/id). While not directly affecting reachability, its definition confirms how the argument is marshalled and which union member is used; this is required to fully understand the call into OS_TaskEntryPoint (e.g. whether a valid id is passed) and to rule out any code-path-dependent behavior that could cause OS_TaskEntryPoint to return."
