OS_PthreadTaskEntry calls OS_TaskEntryPoint(local_arg.id), which (via OS_TaskExit \u2192 OS_TaskExit_Impl) is documented/implemented to never return. Therefore execution cannot reach the subsequent return statement, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\ntypedef union {\n    void *opaque_arg;\n    unsigned long id;\n} OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t;\nextern void OS_TaskEntryPoint(unsigned long id);\n\nstatic void *OS_PthreadTaskEntry(void *arg)\n{\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t local_arg;\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    local_arg.opaque_arg = arg;\n\n    /* Open log file (append).

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. MISRA Rule 2.1 prohibits code that is provably unreachable in the project model. A call site followed by a return is only unreachable if the called routine is provably non\u2011returning (for example, defined in the project as not returning or annotated with _Noreturn/[[noreturn]]/__attribute__((noreturn))). In the supplied code OS_TaskEntryPoint is merely declared extern and only commented as \u201cNever returns\u201d; that comment alone does not make the return statement provably unreachable to the compiler or to a static analysis unless the callee\u2019s non\u2011returning behaviour is expressed in the code (definition in the project that never returns, or a noreturn annotation). Therefore, on the information given, the trailing return NULL; cannot be classified as unreachable and does not by itself demonstrate a Rule 2.1 violation. (If in the actual project OS_TaskEntryPoint is defined/annotated as non\u2011returning, then indeed the return would be provably unreachable and would violate Rule 2.1; that specific evidence was not provided.)"
