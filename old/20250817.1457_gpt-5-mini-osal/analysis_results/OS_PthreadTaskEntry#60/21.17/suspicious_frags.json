  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the submitted code fragment. The function only assigns a void* into a union member and forwards a union field to OS_TaskEntryPoint; there are no string handling operations or buffer copies that could cause accesses beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need investigation for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Note: other potential concerns such as union aliasing or pointer casting are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and thus not reported here.)"
