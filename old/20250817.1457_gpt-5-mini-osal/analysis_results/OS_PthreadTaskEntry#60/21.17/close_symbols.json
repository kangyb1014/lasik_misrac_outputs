  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n\n- OS_TaskEntryPoint (implementation and prototype): OS_PthreadTaskEntry only forwards its argument to OS_TaskEntryPoint. Any use of string.h functions that could access out-of-bounds memory would be inside OS_TaskEntryPoint (or its callees). You must inspect its body to find any calls to memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc. and the pointer arguments passed to them.\n\n- OS_TaskPrepare (implementation and prototype): OS_TaskEntryPoint calls OS_TaskPrepare (per the call graph). OS_TaskPrepare may perform initialization that uses string functions or manipulates buffers; its implementation is required to determine whether any string operations can access beyond object bounds.\n\n- OS_TaskExit (implementation and prototype): Similarly, OS_TaskEntryPoint calls OS_TaskExit. OS_TaskExit could contain string operations or buffer accesses that must be checked for OOB access.\n\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (typedef/definition): The local union/struct controls how the incoming void *arg is interpreted (opaque_arg versus id). You need the exact definition to verify the sizes and aliasing rules: e.g., whether converting a pointer to id could lead to incorrect pointer arithmetic, truncated values, or misinterpreted addresses that later become inputs to string.h functions.\n\n- The type of local_arg.id (the exact typedef used inside OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t): To judge safety you must know the width/representation of id (integer type, pointer-sized integer, handle) and how it will be used by the callee(s). This affects whether the passed value is a valid pointer or an index into buffers that string functions may access.\n\n- All global data structures and buffers referenced by OS_TaskEntryPoint / OS_TaskPrepare / OS_TaskExit (e.g. task control blocks, task name/stack buffers): If any string.h functions are used, you must know the target objects (their sizes and lifetimes) to decide whether the calls could access beyond their bounds. These include task tables, name buffers, stack/storage buffers, or any pointer fields derived from the passed id/arg.\n\nIn short: because OS_PthreadTaskEntry only forwards an argument, the safety relative to string.h usage depends entirely on the callee implementations and the data types/layouts used to interpret the forwarded argument and any global buffers they touch. Provide the listed symbols/definitions so the next analyst can trace all string.h usages and validate pointer/length arguments against actual object bounds."
