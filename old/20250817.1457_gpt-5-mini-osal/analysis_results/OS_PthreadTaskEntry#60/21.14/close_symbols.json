  "explanation": "- OS_TaskEntryPoint: The target calls this function with local_arg.id. You must inspect its body to see whether it (or functions it calls) calls memcmp on that value or otherwise treats the argument as a null-terminated string.\\n- OS_TaskPrepare and OS_TaskExit: These are direct callees of OS_TaskEntryPoint (per the call graph). Their implementations must be checked for memcmp usages or for passing the argument along to other memcmp callers.\\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The union/type definition is required to know what the union members represent and how the conversion from opaque_arg to id is meant to be interpreted.\\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t.id (member type): You need the exact type of the id member to determine whether the value passed to OS_TaskEntryPoint is (or can be) a char* pointing to a null-terminated string (which would make memcmp use relevant).\\n- memcmp: Include the standard library symbol so the analyzer can identify calls to memcmp (and check argument types and call sites) to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings."
