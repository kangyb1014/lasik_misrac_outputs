  "explanation": "No usage of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided code fragment. There are no string operations or comparisons of null\u2011terminated strings (no char* manipulation, no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or similar). The code only assigns a pointer into a union member and calls OS_TaskEntryPoint, so there is nothing that would trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this snippet."
