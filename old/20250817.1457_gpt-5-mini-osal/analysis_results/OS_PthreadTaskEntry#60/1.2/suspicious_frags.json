  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The code contains only standard C constructs: a static function returning void*, local variable declaration, member access of a (presumed) union/struct type, and a function call. The comment /* cppcheck-suppress ... */ is a static-analysis hint, not a compiler extension. There are no compiler-specific keywords (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, #pragma with compiler-specific semantics) or implementation-specific pragmas/macros present that are documented as compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
