    "OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (complete type/union definition, including any nested anonymous members or attributes)",
    "OS_TaskEntryPoint (declaration and definition as visible to the translator, including any function attributes or macros applied)",
    "Any macros or attribute-definitions used in the above (for example OS_NORETURN, __attribute__((...)), _Noreturn, __extension__, or typedef wrappers)",

  ],
  "explanation": "1) OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The target function relies on writing one union member (opaque_arg) and passing another member (id). To decide whether this is using a language extension you must see the union's actual definition: it may contain anonymous/unnamed unions or fields, use compiler-specific attributes (transparent_union, packed, aligned), or other non-standard constructs. Any such keywords or syntax would be a language extension and must be visible.\n\n2) OS_TaskEntryPoint (declaration/definition): The call to OS_TaskEntryPoint is followed by a comment \"Never returns\" and the function returns NULL after the call. Whether that is valid or relies on a compiler extension depends on the function's declaration/attributes (for example use of __attribute__((noreturn)) or a macro like OS_NORETURN). Those attributes/macros are often compiler-specific extensions and must be inspected.\n\n3) Macros/attribute definitions used in the above: Many projects hide compiler extensions behind macros (e.g. OS_NORETURN -> __attribute__((noreturn)) or _Noreturn). You must examine those macro definitions (and any uses of __attribute__, __declspec, transparent_union, etc.) to decide if a non-standard extension is used.\n\n4) Translation-unit/compiler-condition macros: Conditional compilation based on __GNUC__, __clang__, _MSC_VER, or project-specific flags can enable alternate code paths that use extensions. To be sure the target function (or the symbols above) does not depend on an extension you must know which compiler-specific branches are active."
