Because the pointer could (and should) be const-qualified (e.g. const void *opaque_arg) to indicate the pointee is not modified, the current declaration violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_LogPthreadProbe(const char *event, void *arg)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/483.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Log the event name, pointer value and whether it is NULL. */\n        fprintf(f, \"[OS_PthreadTaskEntry] %s: arg=%p is_null=%d\\n\",\n                event,\n                arg,\n                (arg == NULL) ? 1 : 0);\n        fflush(f);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nstatic void *OS_PthreadTaskEntry(void *arg)\n{\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t local_arg;\n\n    /* Log entry and initial argument value. */\n    OS_LogPthreadProbe(\"entry\", arg);\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    local_arg.opaque_arg = arg;\n\n    /* Log after assignment to the union member.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 does encourage adding const to pointer target types when the pointee is not modified, but this must be judged in the full API/context and not just by observing that this function does not dereference the pointer. Two practical reasons show this is not a violation here:\n\n- The pthread start routine prototype is fixed by POSIX: the thread entry must have the signature void *(*start_routine)(void *). OS_PthreadTaskEntry must accept a void * argument to match that API. You cannot change the parameter type to const void * without breaking the required prototype.\n\n- The pointer is stored into a union (OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t) that is being used for value-punning (the code assigns the pointer into opaque_arg and then reads another union member id). That union is a generic transport of a pointer/word and may be used elsewhere for non-const operations. Declaring the union member as const void * could prevent other necessary assignments or create qualification mismatches when the same union is used in contexts that require a non-const pointer.\n\nAlso, MISRA guidance allows exceptions where external API signatures or legitimate design reasons prevent adding const. Given the required pthread signature and the union/value-punning usage, it is not appropriate to conclude a definite Rule 8.13 violation from the excerpt. The empty test log is unrelated to the rule determination.\n\nTherefore the claim that this code violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is incorrect."
