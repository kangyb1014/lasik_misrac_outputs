  "explanation": "- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: needed to see the types of the union members (opaque_arg and id). The wrapper determines whether the function is treating the incoming arg as a pointer, an integer, or performing a cast \u2014 crucial to decide if arg could/should be const-qualified.\n- OS_TaskEntryPoint: its prototype and implementation are required to determine how the passed value (local_arg.id) is interpreted and used (e.g. whether it is treated as a pointer and whether the pointed-to object is modified). This directly answers whether the original arg should be const.\n- OS_TaskPrepare: called (transitively) by OS_TaskEntryPoint; included because OS_TaskEntryPoint may forward the value and these callees might modify the pointed-to object. To decide const-qualification safely you must inspect transitive uses.\n- OS_TaskExit: same reason as OS_TaskPrepare \u2014 it may receive/operate on the value passed through OS_TaskEntryPoint and could perform non-const modifications that prevent making the original pointer const."
