  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n\n- OS_TaskEntryPoint\n  - The target function's only call is OS_TaskEntryPoint. To decide whether code after that call (notably the return NULL) is ever executed or whether any preceding operations are redundant, you must examine OS_TaskEntryPoint's implementation and/or its function attributes (for example, a noreturn annotation). If OS_TaskEntryPoint truly never returns (calls an exit primitive, performs an infinite loop, or is declared noreturn), the return statement in OS_PthreadTaskEntry is unreachable; knowing whether it actually executes is required to decide if any executed operation in OS_PthreadTaskEntry is dead.\n\n- OS_TaskPrepare\n  - Static call graph shows OS_TaskEntryPoint calls OS_TaskPrepare. OS_TaskPrepare may perform control-flow actions (longjmp, set up and then call an exit path, etc.) or alter whether OS_TaskEntryPoint returns. Inspecting OS_TaskPrepare is necessary to understand the full control-flow/effects of OS_TaskEntryPoint and therefore whether subsequent code in the caller is executed or redundant.\n\n- OS_TaskExit\n  - OS_TaskEntryPoint calls OS_TaskExit. OS_TaskExit is a likely candidate to terminate the thread (e.g., call pthread_exit or similar) or otherwise prevent return. Determining whether OS_TaskExit returns (or is noreturn) is essential to conclude whether the caller's post-call code is reachable/executed and thus whether any executed operation could be dead.\n\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t\n  - The local variable is of this type and the code assigns to local_arg.opaque_arg then passes local_arg.id to OS_TaskEntryPoint. You must inspect the union/struct definition to determine whether writing opaque_arg and reading id is a valid/useful operation (aliasing behavior, overlap of members). If the write has no effect on the value actually used (or is undefined), that assignment could be redundant or have no runtime effect; conversely, if it is the intended conversion mechanism, it is necessary. Understanding the type layout and semantics is required to determine whether the assignment is dead code.\n\n(Also inspect any function-level attributes or macros attached to OS_TaskEntryPoint/OS_TaskExit such as noreturn annotations or documentation that affect reachability; these are part of the OS_TaskEntryPoint/OS_TaskExit symbols.)"
