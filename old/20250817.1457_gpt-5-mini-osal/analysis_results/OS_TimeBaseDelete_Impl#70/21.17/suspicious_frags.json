  "explanation": "No other code fragments invoke the string.h functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The remaining calls in the function are to pthread_cancel and timer_delete (not string functions). The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET/OS_ObjectIndexFromToken usage is an array index/address operation and does not use any string handling routines. The struct members and other symbols shown are not string.h functions or calls that take pointer parameters to character arrays, so they cannot cause out-of-bounds accesses under Rule 21.17."
