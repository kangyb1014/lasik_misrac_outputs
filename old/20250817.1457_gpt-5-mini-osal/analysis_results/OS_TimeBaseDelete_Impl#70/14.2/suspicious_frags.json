First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for loops are present in the provided target function or the related inline/macro definitions. Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements and their three clauses; the code in OS_TimeBaseDelete_Impl contains only: a table lookup via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (macro expands to an array index via OS_ObjectIndexFromToken), a call to pthread_cancel, a simple if-test of local->assigned_signal, and a call to timer_delete. None of these constructs are for statements or expand to for statements based on the provided definitions. The related symbols shown (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_impl_timebase_table, the structure definition, and the macros/defines) contain no for loops either. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2.\n\nNote: functions called (pthread_cancel, timer_delete, or any other externally defined functions) could internally contain for loops; those implementations were not provided and are outside the scope of this fragment review. If those implementations are to be checked for Rule 14.2 compliance, their source must be supplied for review."
