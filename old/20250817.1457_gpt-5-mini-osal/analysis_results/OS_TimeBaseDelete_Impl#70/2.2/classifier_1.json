The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TimeBaseDelete_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TimeBaseDelete_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_timebase_internal_record_t *local;\n    int                                 status;\n\n    local = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_timebase_table, *token);\n\n    pthread_cancel(local->handler_thread);\n\n    /*\n    ** Delete the timer\n    */\n    if (local->assigned_signal != 0)\n    {\n        status = timer_delete(local->host_timerid);\n        if (status < 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"Error deleting timer: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n            return OS_TIMER_ERR_INTERNAL;\n        }\n\n        local->assigned_signal = 0;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TimeBaseDelete_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_timebase_internal_record_t OS_impl_timebase_table[OS_MAX_TIMEBASES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_t       handler_thread;\n    pthread_mutex_t handler_mutex;\n    timer_t         host_timerid;\n    int             assigned_signal;\n    sigset_t        sigset;\n    sig_atomic_t    reset_flag;\n    struct timespec softsleep;\n} OS_impl_timebase_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define OS_TIMER_ERR_INTERNAL (-32)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_DEBUG(\"Error deleting timer: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro, so the invocation expands to nothing and generates no executed operation. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets operations that are executed but removable without affecting behaviour; since this statement does not exist in the compiled code it is not dead code. (If instead OS_DEBUG expanded to code that executed but had no effect/side\u2011effects, that would be a violation.)"
