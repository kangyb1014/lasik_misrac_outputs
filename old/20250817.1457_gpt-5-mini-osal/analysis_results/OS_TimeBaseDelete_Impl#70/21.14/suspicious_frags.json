  "explanation": "I inspected the implementation of OS_TimeBaseDelete_Impl and the provided related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp in the target function or in the supplied auxiliary code/macros. The only string-related call is strerror(errno) used purely for debug output; this does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. No other code fragments perform string comparisons (no custom loops or function calls that appear to compare C strings via memcmp). Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
