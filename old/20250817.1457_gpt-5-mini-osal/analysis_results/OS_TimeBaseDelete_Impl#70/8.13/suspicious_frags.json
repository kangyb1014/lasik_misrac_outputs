  "explanation": "Other pointer usages do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *token); OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to take a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *), so its parameter is correctly const-qualified; the local pointer (OS_impl_timebase_internal_record_t *local) is used to modify the record (assigned_signal is set to 0 and other operations occur), so it cannot be const; the global table OS_impl_timebase_table is a mutable array used for modifications. No other pointer declarations in the provided code could reasonably be made to point to const without changing intended behavior."
