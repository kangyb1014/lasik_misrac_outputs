  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code. The constructs used are standard C or POSIX library features rather than compiler extensions:\n- pthread_cancel, pthread_t, timer_delete, timer_t, strerror, errno, sigset_t, sig_atomic_t and struct timespec are POSIX/C library types and functions, not language extensions.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the use of a variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) rely on standard C preprocessor features (variadic macros are standard since C99), not compiler-specific extensions.\n- There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific language extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, anonymous/unnamed language-extension-only constructs, or other vendor-specific keywords.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (usage of language/compiler extensions)."
