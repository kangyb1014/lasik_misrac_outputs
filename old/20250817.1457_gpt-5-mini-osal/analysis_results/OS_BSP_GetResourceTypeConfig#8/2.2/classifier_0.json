  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig:\n```c\nuint32 OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig(uint32 ResourceType)\n{\n    uint32 ConfigOptionValue;\n\n    if (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER)\n    {\n        ConfigOptionValue = OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig[ResourceType];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ConfigOptionValue = 0;\n    }\n\n    return ConfigOptionValue;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig:\nextern OS_BSP_GlobalData_t OS_BSP_Global\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER 0x10\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for the fragment as shown. Both branches can affect the returned value (array element vs 0), so there is no evidence of dead code. A specific violation scenario would be: if it is guaranteed (by the type, an enum range, or all call sites) that ResourceType is always < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER (OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER == 0x10) then the else branch (assigning 0 and returning it) would never be executed and would be dead code. In that case removing the else branch would not change program behaviour and Rule 2.2 would be violated."
