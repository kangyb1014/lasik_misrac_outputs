  "explanation": "To determine whether the parameter ResourceType is modified (MISRA: a function parameter shall not be modified), the analyzer must know the concrete types and any possible macro expansions that could introduce hidden side effects: \n\n- uint32 (typedef): Confirms that ResourceType is a value type (not a pointer). If uint32 were a typedef to a pointer type or an unusual type, semantics about modification would differ.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: Its definition (macro or enum) is needed to ensure the comparison (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER) does not expand into code that modifies ResourceType. Also confirms it is a constant/non-side-effect expression.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: The definition of this global object is required to see whether OS_BSP_Global itself is a plain object or is a macro/function-like construct that could cause side effects when accessed.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig (member): The exact declaration (is it an array, function-like macro, or accessor) is required because a macro or accessor could use ResourceType in a way that modifies it. The source code uses indexing into ResoureConfig with ResourceType; the analyzer must confirm that indexing is a simple read and not a macro that writes to ResourceType.\n\n- type of OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig elements: Knowing the element type (and any overloaded/indirect accessors) ensures that the array access expression cannot implicitly modify the index or the parameter (for example, via side-effecting getter macros).\n\n- any preprocessor macros that redefine ResoureConfig or OS_BSP_Global: A macro could replace the apparent field access with code that assigns to ResourceType (or otherwise has side effects). The analyzer needs the preprocessor definitions to rule out such hidden modifications.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyst confirm that no assignment or side effect in the function body modifies the parameter ResourceType (directly or indirectly via macros or accessor expansions)."
