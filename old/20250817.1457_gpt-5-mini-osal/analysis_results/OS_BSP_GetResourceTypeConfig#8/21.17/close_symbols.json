  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses (which is what the MISRA string\u2011handling rule guards against when string functions are later used on data), the analyzer must know the exact shape and bounds of the data being indexed and the comparison constant used to guard that indexing:  \n\n- OS_BSP_Global (definition): the actual global instance must be inspected to reach the ResoureConfig member.  \n- Type/struct definition for OS_BSP_Global: reveals whether ResoureConfig is an array member, pointer, or computed/embedded object and the type of its elements.  \n- OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig declaration (element type and size/form): required to determine valid index range and whether indexing by ResourceType can access memory beyond the object. If ResoureConfig is a pointer, its allocation semantics matter; if an array, its compile\u2011time size is needed.  \n- Macros/constants used to dimension ResoureConfig: if the array size is defined by a macro (e.g. OS_MAX_RESOURCE_TYPES), the analyzer must know that value to compare against OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER and ResourceType.  \n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER (definition/value): the code uses this constant to gate indexing; its numeric value (and relation to the array size) determines whether the guard actually prevents out\u2011of\u2011bounds indexes.  \n- typedef/definition of uint32: to know width and unsignedness for safe comparison/indexing semantics (prevents signed/unsigned mismatch assumptions).  \n- Initialization/allocation sites for ResoureConfig: if ResoureConfig is dynamically allocated or populated elsewhere, those sites determine its runtime size and lifetime (affects whether indexing can be invalid).  \n- Static assertions/invariants linking OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER and ResoureConfig size: any compile\u2011time guarantees (static_assert, enum relations, documented invariants) can prove the guard is sufficient; absence of such guarantees requires explicit size/value checks.  \n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer decide if the conditional (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER) actually bounds the index from exceeding ResoureConfig, and therefore whether any subsequent string/memory operations on ResoureConfig elements could violate the MISRA rule about out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses. Note: the target function itself does not call <string.h> functions, but determining compliance requires proving the indexing is safe (so that later uses of the memory by string functions would not access out-of-bounds)."
