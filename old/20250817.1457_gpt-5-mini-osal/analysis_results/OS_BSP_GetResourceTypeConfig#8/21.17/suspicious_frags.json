  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appears in the provided function. The code only performs an integer comparison and an array indexing into OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig[ResourceType], and that indexing is guarded by the condition ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER. There are no pointer parameters passed to standard string functions and no calls that could access beyond object bounds via the <string.h> API. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
