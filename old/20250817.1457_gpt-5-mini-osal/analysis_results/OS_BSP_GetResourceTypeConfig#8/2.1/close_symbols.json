  "explanation": "- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: The if condition compares ResourceType against this symbol. Its value (macro/enum) determines whether the condition can ever be true or false; if it is 0 or some other fixed constant the then/else branches may be statically unreachable.\n- uint32 (typedef): Knowing the exact typedef (signedness and width) is required to reason about the comparison semantics (unsigned vs signed) and whether certain constant comparisons are always true/false.\n- OS_BSP_Global (object): The global variable is referenced in the then-branch. Its presence/visibility and linkage confirm that the then-branch has an observable effect; its absence or different definition could render that branch unreachable or ill-formed.\n- type/definition of OS_BSP_Global (structure) including member ResoureConfig: The structure definition is required to verify that ResoureConfig exists and to understand its type (e.g., array vs pointer). This affects whether indexing by ResourceType is valid and whether the then-branch is meaningful.\n- size/length (and element type) of OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig: If ResoureConfig has zero length, a fixed small length, or is otherwise constrained, that may make the then-branch unreachable for all possible ResourceType values; knowing the element type also helps determine whether the assignment in the then-branch is valid.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine whether the condition ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER can ever evaluate both true and false (reachability of then/else), and whether the then-branch has a valid effect \u2014 which is necessary to decide if any code in the function is unreachable per MISRA C."
