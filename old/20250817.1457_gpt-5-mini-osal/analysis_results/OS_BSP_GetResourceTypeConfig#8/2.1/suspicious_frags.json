  "explanation": "The only fragments that can affect reachability in this function are the conditional test (and its two branches) and the macro that defines the comparison threshold. The declaration of ConfigOptionValue and the final return statement are always reachable (the declaration is executed on function entry and the return is executed after either branch), so they do not need investigation for Rule 2.1. The array access inside the true branch is a runtime action guarded by the condition (so reachability depends on that condition rather than being intrinsically unreachable) and should be checked for bounds/safety separately but not for unreachable-code per se. Therefore only the if-branch, the else-branch, and the OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER definition need to be investigated to determine whether either branch can never be taken (i.e., whether unreachable code exists)."
