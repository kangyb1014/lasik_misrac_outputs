  "explanation": "1) OS_BSP_Global (definition/declaration of the global variable): needed to see whether the global object itself is declared const or not and to locate the ResoureConfig member. The const-qualification of the global affects whether reads from it should be via pointer-to-const and whether the code violates the MISRA pointer-to-const guidance.\n\n2) ResoureConfig member declaration (type and qualifiers) inside OS_BSP_Global's struct: required to determine the exact type of ResoureConfig (e.g. array of uint32, pointer to uint32, pointer-to-pointer, const-qualified or not) and thus whether any pointer involved should be const-qualified. This is the primary symbol to judge the MISRA rule applicability (pointer vs non-pointer, presence/absence of const).\n\n3) OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER (macro/enum constant): required to understand the bound check and to relate ResourceType to the valid index range. If ResoureConfig is an array, the relation between OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER and the array dimension is needed to assess whether indexing uses a pointer and whether const qualification would be appropriate for that pointer.\n\n4) Size/length macro used to dimension ResoureConfig (e.g. OS_MAX_RESOURCE_TYPES) if present: if ResoureConfig is an array, knowing the array size macro lets you verify that ResourceType indexing is bounded and whether the array is intended to be immutable (which would argue for const qualification). This symbol helps determine whether ResoureConfig should be declared as pointer-to-const/const array.\n\n5) typedef/definition of uint32: needed to confirm the base type and whether any const qualification would apply to that type (e.g. const uint32 vs uint32) and to ensure correct interpretation of types when checking for pointer-to-const requirements."
