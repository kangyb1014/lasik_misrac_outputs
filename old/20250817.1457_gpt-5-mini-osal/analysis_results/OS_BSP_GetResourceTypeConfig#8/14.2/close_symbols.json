The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER\n  - The conditional (ResourceType < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER) depends on this symbol. To prove there are no hidden for-loops or side effects you must confirm OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER is a simple constant/enum/macro without function calls or code that could contain a for loop or persistent side effects.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global\n  - The function reads OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig; the definition of the global object is needed to determine whether access is a plain read or an accessor that invokes code (possibly containing for-loops) or has side effects (volatile, overloaded via macros, etc.).\n\n- OS_BSP_Global (type/struct definition)\n  - The struct/type declaration shows whether ResoureConfig is a simple member (e.g. an array or pointer) or something more complex (e.g. defined via macros or properties). This determines whether the read in this function can invoke code that might contain for loops or modify state relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig (member declaration/definition)\n  - Need the exact declaration: is it an array, pointer, macro, or an accessor? If it is a macro or implemented via an inline function, that code must be inspected for any for-loops or side effects that would be considered part of any loop body per MISRA.\n\n- type of ResoureConfig elements (e.g. element type and array size)\n  - To check whether indexing or the read operation has any non-trivial behavior (e.g. if element access has special semantics), and to ensure no implicit conversions or side effects are introduced.\n\n- typedef/definition of uint32\n  - Confirms the exact integer type used for ResourceType and return value. While not likely to introduce for-loops, the typedef could reveal implementation-specific behavior (e.g. if uint32 is a macro or mapped to something unusual) that must be excluded.\n\n- Any macros or inline functions used to define OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER or ResoureConfig (their definitions)\n  - A catch-all: if either symbol is implemented via macros/inline functions, those definitions must be provided so they can be scanned for hidden for-loops or side effects. MISRA treats the behaviour of called functions as part of loop bodies; similarly any code invoked by these symbols could contain for-loops that affect compliance.\n\nNotes:\n- The target function itself contains no for loop. The main risk for violating the MISRA for-loop rule would come from hidden code executed as part of the evaluated expressions or as side-effects of the referenced symbols. The symbols above are exactly those needed to determine whether any hidden for-loops or side-effects exist in the evaluated expressions or data accesses used by OS_BSP_GetResourceTypeConfig."
