  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA rule banning the use of memcmp for comparing null\u2011terminated strings you must inspect any symbol definitions that could hide or invoke memcmp or that change the effective types/semantics used here:\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: The global object\u2019s declaration/definition is required to see how its members are defined and whether any accessor macros/functions are used that might call memcmp or perform string comparisons.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.ResoureConfig: The specific member being indexed must be examined to know its type (array of integers, array of pointers to char, macro that expands to a function, etc.). If this member is a macro or an object whose initializer or accessor uses memcmp (or stores/returns strings), that would be relevant to the MISRA memcmp rule.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: The range/constant used in the if condition influences which code path is taken; knowing its value/type (enum/macro) is necessary to determine whether the array indexing can be triggered and therefore whether any hidden memcmp usage in the indexed member can be reached.\n\n- uint32 (typedef): The underlying type is needed to understand the assignment semantics and whether any implicit casts/truncation occur (for example if ResoureConfig elements are actually pointers or strings cast to integer types via macros), which could indicate indirection to string data or string-comparison behavior.\n\n- memcmp: The declaration/definitions/usages of memcmp in the translation unit or in macros used by the above symbols must be searched. If memcmp is used inside any of the inspected symbols (macros, initializers, accessors), that would constitute the MISRA violation even though the target function does not directly call memcmp."
