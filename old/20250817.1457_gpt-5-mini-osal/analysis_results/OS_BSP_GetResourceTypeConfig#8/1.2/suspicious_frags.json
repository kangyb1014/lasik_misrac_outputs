  "explanation": "No language extensions are present in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: a function definition, a typedef-like integer type name (uint32 \u2014 assumed to be a user typedef, which is not a compiler extension), integer comparison, array indexing, conditional (if/else), assignment and return. There are no compiler-specific keywords or operators (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({...}), nested functions, inline assembler, vendor-specific pragmas, or other documented compiler extensions). Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
