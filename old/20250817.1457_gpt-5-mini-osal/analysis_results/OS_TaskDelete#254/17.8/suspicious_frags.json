  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter, 'osal_id_t task_id', which is only used as a value argument when calling OS_ObjectIdGetById; there are no assignments to task_id, no taking of its address, and it is not otherwise modified. All assignments in the routine target local variables (token, task, delete_hook), and pointer parameters are not present in this function signature. Therefore no code fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and there are no suspicious fragments to investigate."
