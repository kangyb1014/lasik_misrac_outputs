  "explanation": "The remaining lines (variable declarations, the final return statement, typedefs and macro definitions shown in the supplemental code) are straightforward declarations or simple return/value mappings and do not by themselves create unreachable code paths. The function has a single entry and a single exit point; standard declarations (int32 return_code; int result; struct timespec ts; OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t *impl;) and the final \"return return_code;\" are always reachable when the function executes and do not introduce conditional or dead branches. The macro/type definitions provided (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_queue_table, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, the integer constant definitions, and the typedefs) are simple lookups or aliases and do not contain internal control-flow that would render source lines in OS_QueuePut_Impl unreachable. Therefore only the listed fragments need further investigation for potential unreachable-code issues under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
