  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No \u2014 as written this does not violate Rule 21.17. The call memset(&ts, 0, sizeof(ts)) writes exactly sizeof(ts) bytes into the object ts, so it does not access beyond the bounds. A specific violation scenario would be if the size argument exceeded the object size, e.g. memset(&ts, 0, sizeof(ts) + 1) (or passing a larger size / wrong pointer), which would write past the bounds and violate the rule."
