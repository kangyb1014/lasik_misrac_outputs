  "explanation": "Only the uses of the function parameters are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. I inspected the rest of the function and found no assignments to any parameter variables (token, data, size, flags) \u2014 they are not modified in the function body. The memset(&ts, ...) modifies a local variable (ts), impl is a local pointer assigned from the object table macro, and return_code/result/errno handling only use local variables or globals. The two fragments reported are the only places where pointer parameters are acted upon: token is dereferenced in the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET call and data is forwarded to mq_timedsend. These should be investigated to ensure the pointer variables themselves are not being modified (and to check any macro expansion or external call side-effects). No other code fragments in this function require investigation under Rule 17.8 because they do not modify function parameters."
