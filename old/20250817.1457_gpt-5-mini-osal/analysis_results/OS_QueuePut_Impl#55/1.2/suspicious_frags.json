  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in this function. The code contains: standard C constructs (typedef-like names int32/uint32 and size_t, struct declaration, local variable declarations), POSIX APIs/macros (struct timespec, mq_timedsend, errno, EINTR, ETIMEDOUT), and project macros (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) \u2014 none of which are compiler-specific language extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, GCC/Clang builtins, zero-length arrays, or other vendor-specific keywords. The usage of memset, do/while, and the macros/typedefs shown are standard and not listed as compiler extensions in mainstream compiler documentation, so no fragments require investigation for Rule 1.2."
