First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements (their three clauses and loop counter usage). The provided target function UT_StoreRetval contains no for loops \u2014 it uses a switch statement and direct assignments. The additional definitions (UT_GENRE_SIZE macro, the UT_RetvalBuf_t union, integer typedefs, UtAssert_Failed macro and UtAssert_GetContext function) also contain no for statements or loop constructs. Therefore there are no for-loop fragments to investigate for Rule 14.2 in the supplied code. Note: behaviour of called functions would matter if a for loop were present in the caller; the only called function-like macro here is UtAssert_Failed (expands to UtAssertEx), but since there is no for loop at the call site, Rule 14.2 is not applicable to these calls in this code. Consequently, no code fragments need to be reported for investigation under Rule 14.2."
