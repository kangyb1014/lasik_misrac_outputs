  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasons:\n- The parameter Memory is declared as const void * and is not modified anywhere in the function. The assignment const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory creates a local pointer variable; this does not modify the function parameter itself (Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the parameter, not creating/using local copies).\n- Byte_ptr is a pointer to const uint8 and is only used for read access (Byte_ptr[i] is compared, not assigned), so neither the pointer parameter nor the pointed-to object is being modified.\n- The parameter Length is a value parameter (uint32) and is not modified; the loop uses a separate local variable i for iteration.\n- There are no casts removing const qualification, no assignments to Memory or Length, and no pointer arithmetic that writes through the pointer.\nTherefore, the function complies with the rule and no fragments require further investigation."
