  "explanation": "To decide whether this function modifies a parameter (MISRA rule), the analyzer must know the exact meanings of the types and any typedefs/macros that could change semantics: \n\n- uint8: The function casts Memory to const uint8* and indexes through that pointer. The analyzer must know whether uint8 is an unsigned char (or some other type) and whether it is a typedef or macro that could imply different pointer/aliasing or const behavior. This affects whether the cast or indexing could be treated as modifying the parameter itself.\n\n- uint32: The loop index i and the Length parameter use uint32. The analyzer must know the underlying integer type to reason about whether Length is a modifiable parameter (e.g. if uint32 were a reference-like macro) and to ensure no hidden side effects from the type definition.\n\n- bool: The return type; the analyzer must know whether bool is a plain _Bool/typedef or a macro that might expand to something with side effects (unlikely but possible in nonstandard code).\n\n- declaration/prototype of UtMemCmpCount (header): The local signature shown may differ from a header prototype (for example, parameter qualifiers could differ in a public prototype). The analyzer must confirm the parameter is actually declared as 'const void *Memory' in the externally visible prototype so it can determine whether the pointer parameter's object is intended to be const and ensure the pointer itself is not being modified.\n\n- any typedefs/macros that define uint8/uint32/bool: If those names are macros or aliases that expand to expressions or to types with unusual semantics, that could change whether the code modifies a parameter. The analyzer needs the exact preprocessor/type definitions to be sure the function does not modify its parameters.\n\nNote: No other global variables or functions are referenced in the function; Byte_ptr and i are local and are visible in the function body already. With the above symbols resolved, the analyzer can conclude whether the function modifies the pointer parameter itself (it does not \u2014 it copies Memory into a local pointer and does not assign to Memory or Length)."
