  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. Specific reasoning: \n\n- The function signature and return type (bool) are standard C (C99 _Bool via stdbool.h or a user typedef); the code does not use any compiler-specific boolean extension. If a compiler did not provide bool, that would be an environmental issue (missing include or typedef), not a language-extension use in the code itself. \n- The integer typedefs (uint32, uint8) are aliases of the standard stdint types (uint32_t, uint8_t) as shown; these are not compiler extensions. \n- The assignment from a void pointer (Memory) to a pointer to uint8 (const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;) is valid in standard C (void* to object pointer conversion is allowed without a cast). This would be invalid in C++, but that is a language difference, not a compiler extension in this C code. \n- The for loop, array indexing (Byte_ptr[i]), bitwise operation (i & 0xFF), and return statements use standard C constructs only. \n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that explicitly rely on compiler-documented language extensions that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
