  "explanation": "bool: The function return type uses the identifier \"bool\". To determine whether this is a standard language feature (e.g. the stdbool.h macro alias to the C99 _Bool) or a project/compiler-provided typedef or extension, the analyzer must see the actual definition of \"bool\".\n\nuint32: The function uses the identifier \"uint32\" as a type. The analyzer must know the typedef/define for \"uint32\" (for example whether it aliases a standard fixed-width type like uint32_t, or uses a compiler-specific extended type) to decide if the code relies on nonstandard/compiler-specific type extensions.\n\nuint8: The pointer type \"const uint8 *\" is used. As with uint32, the analyzer needs the exact definition of \"uint8\" to determine if it is a standard typedef (uint8_t) or a compiler/project extension.\n\n__STDC_VERSION__: Whether use of identifiers like \"bool\" is a language feature or an extension depends on the language standard in effect. The predefined macro __STDC_VERSION__ (or equivalent project/compiler configuration indicating the C standard) is required to decide if a given identifier/syntax is part of the standard language or an extension documented by the compiler."
