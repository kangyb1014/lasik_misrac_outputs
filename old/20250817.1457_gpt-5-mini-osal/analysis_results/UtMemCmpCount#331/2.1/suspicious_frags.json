  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments identified. All statements in the function are potentially reachable at runtime: the loop condition (i < Length) depends on the runtime parameter Length, so the loop body may execute or be skipped. The return false inside the loop is reachable when a mismatching byte is found; the return true after the loop is reachable when the loop finishes (including the case Length == 0). There are no constant conditions, unconditional infinite loops, code following an unconditional return, or mutually exclusive branches that are compile-time unreachable. Therefore no fragments require investigation for Rule 2.1."
