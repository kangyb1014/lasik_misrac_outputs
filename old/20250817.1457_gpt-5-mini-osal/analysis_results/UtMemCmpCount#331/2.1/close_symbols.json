  "explanation": "To decide whether any statement in UtMemCmpCount is unreachable you must know more than the local source text:\n\n- uint32 (typedef/underlying type): The loop bound and comparison i < Length depend on the exact underlying type of uint32 (width and signedness). That determines range and wrap/overflow behavior and whether certain comparisons can be proven always false/true by static analysis.\n\n- uint8 (typedef/underlying type): The pointer arithmetic and the equality check Byte_ptr[i] != (i & 0xFF) involve the representation of a byte. Knowing the underlying type for uint8 (usually unsigned 8-bit) is required to reason about possible values and whether the body can be executed or the equality can always/never hold.\n\n- bool / true / false (definition): The return type and the returned constants (true/false) must be known (stdlib stdbool.h or project macros) to ensure they are ordinary values and not macroized into something that could alter control flow or be removed by preprocessing.\n\n- All callers of UtMemCmpCount and the actual expressions/variables passed as Length: Reachability of loop body and of the final return depends on possible runtime values of Length. Static unreachable-code checks must examine call sites (and the values they can pass) to determine whether the for loop can ever iterate. If every call passes Length==0 (or callers are never used), parts of the function could be unreachable.\n\n- Any project/configuration preprocessor macros or #ifdefs that affect inclusion or the body of UtMemCmpCount: Conditional compilation can remove or replace the function or parts of it; to detect unreachable code in the project you must know compile-time options that may make code present/absent.\n\n- Definitions of any global variables or symbols used by callers to compute Length: If callers derive Length from globals/constants, those definitions (and their value ranges) are needed to decide whether the loop can run.\n\n- Target platform integer representation info relevant to the typedefs (widths/signedness): Precise sizes and signedness affect integer promotions (e.g. i & 0xFF) and comparisons; static proofs of unreachable branches depend on those properties.\n\nProviding these symbols (typedefs, callers and their argument/value sources, and relevant preprocessor/platform information) gives a complete context to determine whether any statements in UtMemCmpCount are provably unreachable under the project's build and calling scenarios."
