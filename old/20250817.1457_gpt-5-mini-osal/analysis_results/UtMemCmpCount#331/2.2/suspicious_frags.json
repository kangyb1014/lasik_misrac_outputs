  "explanation": "No suspicious dead-code fragments found. Reasoning: \n- The initialization const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory is used throughout the loop to access bytes; removing it would change behavior, so it is not dead. Initialization is not the same as an assignment (per the rule note) and here is required.\n- The for loop (i = 0; i < Length; i++) is executed when Length > 0 and each iteration performs a meaningful comparison; none of those iterations are inherently removable without changing program behaviour.\n- The comparison Byte_ptr[i] != (i & 0xFF) affects the control flow (early return false) and thus is not dead. The mask (i & 0xFF) may be required for intended wrap behaviour when i >= 256; it cannot be assumed redundant without additional context about Length or intended semantics.\n- Both return points (return false inside the loop and return true at the end) are reachable and determine the function\u2019s result; neither is dead.\n- There is no unreachable code in the function (no statements after return inside the same block, no conditional branches that can never be taken based on local information).\n\nTherefore, within this function there are no executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour, so no fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code)."
