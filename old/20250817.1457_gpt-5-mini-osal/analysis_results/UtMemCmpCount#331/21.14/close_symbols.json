  "explanation": "- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically forbids using the Standard Library memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. To show compliance you must confirm this target function does not call memcmp directly or indirectly.\\n- strncmp: Although the rule targets memcmp, callers may use strncmp or be confused with memcmp; include it to check whether a string-comparison is being done with memcmp-like semantics or if callers misuse other string APIs.\\n- strlen and strnlen: If Length passed into UtMemCmpCount is obtained from strlen/strnlen or other string-length helpers, the function may be being used to compare null-terminated strings. You must trace whether Length originates from these functions at call sites.\\n- All callers of UtMemCmpCount (every call site from the static call graph): The target function\u2019s behaviour relative to the MISRA rule depends on how it is used. You must inspect all call sites to see what Memory points to (a null-terminated string or raw buffer) and how Length is computed/passed.\\n- Any project-specific wrappers around memcmp (e.g., UtMemCmp, OS_Memcmp, MemCmp_*): Projects often wrap standard functions. A wrapper may call memcmp internally; those wrappers must be identified to ensure no indirect memcmp usage or forbidden comparisons occur.\\n- Any functions or symbols that compute/derive the Length argument at call sites (e.g., functions that return string lengths or pass strlen()/strnlen() results): To determine whether the buffer compared is a null-terminated string you must follow the origin of Length at each call site.\\n- Type/typedef definitions for uint8, uint32, and bool: Knowing the exact typedefs (sizes and signedness) is needed to confirm the pointer/length interpretation and rule applicability (e.g., that Memory is treated as byte sequence and Length is in bytes)."
