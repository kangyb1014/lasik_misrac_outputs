  "suspicious_frags": [
    "const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;",
    "for (i = 0; i < Length; i++)",
    "bool UtMemCmpCount(const void *Memory, uint32 Length)",
    "if (Byte_ptr[i] != (i & 0xFF))"
  ],
  "explanation": "The MISRA rule focuses on accesses beyond the bounds of objects referenced by pointer parameters. The function signature introduces a pointer parameter and a length parameter that determine the iteration bounds; the assignment of Memory to Byte_ptr and the indexed access Byte_ptr[i] inside the loop (driven by Length) are the only spots that can cause out-of-bounds access and therefore must be investigated. Other fragments in the function (declaration of i, the constant comparison value, the return true/false statements, and the function body structure) do not perform pointer-based memory accesses and thus are not relevant for this rule. Also, no functions from <string.h> are used in this code, so there are no direct library calls to inspect for this specific rule."
