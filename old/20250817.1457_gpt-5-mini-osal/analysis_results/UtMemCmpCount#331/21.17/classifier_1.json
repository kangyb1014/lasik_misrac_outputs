  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the code fragment does not call any functions from <string.h>. Rule 21.17 applies specifically to the standard string/memory functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The loop (for (i = 0; i < Length; i++)) and the subsequent Byte_ptr[i] accesses could still produce out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses if Length exceeds the actual buffer size, but that is a general bounds safety issue, not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 which targets use of <string.h> functions."
