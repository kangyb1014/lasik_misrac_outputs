  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment only casts a void pointer to a uint8 pointer: const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory; Rule 21.17 specifically concerns use of <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.). No such function is used here, so this fragment does not violate Rule 21.17. (Note: if Memory does not actually point to a buffer of at least Length bytes then later indexing Byte_ptr[i] could cause an out-of-bounds access, but that is a general bounds error and not a violation of Rule 21.17 as stated.)"
