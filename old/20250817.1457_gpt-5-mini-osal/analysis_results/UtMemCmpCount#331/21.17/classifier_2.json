  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function does not call any <string.h> string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). Rule 21.17 concerns use of those library functions causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses; this code performs manual byte comparisons and therefore does not violate Rule 21.17. (Note: the function could still read beyond the actual buffer if Length is incorrect, but that is not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 which specifically targets <string.h> functions.)"
