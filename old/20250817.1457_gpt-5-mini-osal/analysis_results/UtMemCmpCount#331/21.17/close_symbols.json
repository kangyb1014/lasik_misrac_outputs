This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule about use of <string.h> functions and out-of-bounds accesses you must know: (1\u20133) the exact typedefs for bool, uint32 and uint8 (widths, signedness and boolean representation) because loop bounds, index arithmetic and comparisons depend on type widths and conversions; (4\u20136) every call site that passes Memory and Length and the declarations of the actual buffers and the Length values so you can determine whether Byte_ptr[i] (0..Length-1) can legally access the referenced object or can run past its bounds \u2014 the function itself does not call any <string.h> routine, so any violation would come from how it is used; (7) any preprocessor macros that could change the meaning of UtMemCmpCount or its local identifiers (or expand into calls to standard library functions) must be known to rule out hidden uses of <string.h>; (8) project headers or wrapper functions that map to or call standard <string.h> functions (e.g. a project memcmp wrapper) must be inspected to ensure the rule is not violated indirectly. Collecting these symbols (typedefs, call sites, buffer declarations, macros and relevant headers/wrappers) provides the necessary context to prove whether the function itself or its uses can cause out-of-bounds accesses related to the listed <string.h> routines."
