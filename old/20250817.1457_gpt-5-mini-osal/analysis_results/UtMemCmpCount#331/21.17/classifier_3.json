  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The fragment does not call any of the <string.h> functions covered by Rule 21.17. Note: a different violation could occur (out\u2011of\u2011bounds access) if the pointer 'Memory' does not actually refer to at least 'Length' bytes, but that would be a bounds-safety issue, not a Rule 21.17 string-library violation."
