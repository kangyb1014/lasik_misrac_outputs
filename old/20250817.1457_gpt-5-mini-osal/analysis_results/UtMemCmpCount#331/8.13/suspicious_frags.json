  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found w.r.t. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameter is declared as const void *Memory, and the local pointer is declared as const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory; both pointer types are const-qualified. There are no assignments or casts that remove const qualification, no pointers to non-const types, and the pointer is only used for read access. Therefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for violation of Rule 8.13."
