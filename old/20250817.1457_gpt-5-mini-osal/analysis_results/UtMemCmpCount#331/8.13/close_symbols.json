  "explanation": "- typedef of uint8: Needed to know the underlying type (e.g. unsigned char) and whether the typedef itself includes any const/volatile qualifiers. If uint8 were typedef'ed to a const-qualified type the pointer qualifier analysis could change.\\n- typedef of uint32: Needed to confirm the exact integer width/type used for loop index and that no hidden qualifiers affect pointer qualification analysis.\\n- typedef/definition of bool (and true/false): Needed to confirm how boolean values are defined (e.g. stdbool.h or custom macros). Although not directly about pointer constness, verifying bool/true/false definitions ensures there are no macros or typedefs that alter const semantics or perform unexpected casts.\\n- declaration/prototype of UtMemCmpCount (parameter type): The function signature (const void *Memory) is central to the MISRA check; include the prototype/header to confirm the parameter really is const void * and was not modified by a differing declaration elsewhere.\\n- any typedefs/macros that add/remove const qualification for uint8/uint32: Required to detect any project-specific macros/typedefs that change or strip const qualifiers (or introduce casts) which could make the local Byte_ptr or the parameter effectively non-const.\\nThese symbols (typedefs and relevant declarations/macros) are sufficient for the next analyst to determine whether the function uses pointers that are correctly const-qualified or whether any hidden typedefs/macros remove the const qualification and produce a MISRA violation."
