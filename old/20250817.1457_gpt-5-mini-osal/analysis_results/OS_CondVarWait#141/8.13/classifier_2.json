  "scenario": "No violation: 'token' is declared as a value of type OS_object_token_t, not as a pointer. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointers pointing to const-qualified types; it does not apply to non\u2011pointer objects. (If OS_object_token_t were actually a pointer typedef, then const qualification would need to be considered, but from the fragment as written there is no rule 8.13 violation.)"
