  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the shown code. The parameter var_id is only used as an argument to OS_ObjectIdGetById and is not assigned to anywhere in OS_CondVarWait, so it does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The other identifiers are local variables: token and return_code are created and modified locally (permitted). Passing &token to OS_CondVarWait_Impl passes a pointer to a local object \u2014 modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter in a callee is allowed by the rule; the restriction is on modifying the pointer parameter itself. There are no pointer parameters of OS_CondVarWait that are assigned to, so no fragments require further investigation under Rule 17.8."
