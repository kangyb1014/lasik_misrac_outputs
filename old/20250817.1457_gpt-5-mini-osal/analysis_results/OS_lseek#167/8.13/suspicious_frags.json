  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not involve taking or passing pointers and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (which concerns pointer types and whether they should point to const-qualified types). Specifically: the function parameters (osal_id_t filedes, int32 offset, uint32 whence) and the local scalar declaration (int32 return_code) are value types, not pointers; the comment and the final return statement do not affect pointer const-qualification. The three listed call sites pass the address of token (a pointer) and should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to type should be const-qualified in the called functions' interfaces."
