If, however, the implementation legitimately modifies *token, then the non-const pointer is required and there is no violation.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_lseek_log_raw(const char *stage, const OS_object_token_t *token, int32 return_code)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1339.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return; /* Best-effort logging only.

  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s reasoning is logically correct but incomplete: Rule 8.13 concerns how pointer types are declared (they should be const-qualified when the pointed-at object is not modified). The snippet shown does not include the prototype/definition of OS_GenericSeek_Impl, so you cannot determine a MISRA violation from the OS_lseek code alone. If OS_GenericSeek_Impl\u2019s parameter is declared as OS_object_token_t * but the implementation does not modify *token, then the declaration should be changed to const OS_object_token_t * and the agent\u2019s report would be correct. If, however, OS_GenericSeek_Impl legitimately modifies the token, then the non-const parameter is required and there is no violation. The provided runtime logging attempt is inconclusive (no log output), so there is no definitive evidence of a violation in the materials given."
