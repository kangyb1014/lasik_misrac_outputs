  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions (such as GCC __attribute__ annotations, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, inline assembly, labels-as-values, or other non-standard keywords) are visible in the provided function bodies and typedefs. All other constructs in the snippets are standard C (function definitions, typedefs based on stdint types, casts, switch/case, calls to lseek/strerror, usage of errno, macros/constants like OS_SUCCESS, and returning values) and therefore do not by themselves indicate a language extension.\n\nThe two fragments listed are macro invocations (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_DEBUG). The code as shown does not reveal the macro definitions; macros can expand to compiler-specific extensions (for example: use of GNU statement expressions ({ ... }), __attribute__ annotations, token-pasting tricks that rely on compiler-specific behavior, or GCC/Clang extension handling of variadic macros). Because the visible code uses those macros, their expansions must be inspected to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used. No other lines in the provided code exhibit constructs that would typically be language extensions, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 1.2 based on the provided material. If further code (macro/inline definitions, header files, or implementation of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET/OS_DEBUG) is provided, those should be checked for explicit use of compiler-documented extensions (e.g. __attribute__, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, asm, unusual token-pasting, or nonstandard preprocessor behavior)."
