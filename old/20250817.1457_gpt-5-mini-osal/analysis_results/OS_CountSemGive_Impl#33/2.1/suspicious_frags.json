  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code fragments were found in the provided code. Explanation:\n\n- The function OS_CountSemGive_Impl contains two explicit return points: one inside the if (sem_post(&impl->id) < 0) branch and one at the end returning OS_SUCCESS. Both are reachable depending on the runtime result of sem_post; this is ordinary control flow, not unreachable code. Whether sem_post always succeeds or always fails on a particular platform is a runtime/implementation property, not a compile-time unreachable-code violation under Rule 2.1.\n\n- The assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token); is an ordinary expression statement that will execute before the sem_post call; expansion of the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET with the provided argument (*token) yields a valid address expression (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) \u2014 in this call the &(tok) becomes &(*token) which is token, so there is no creation of an address-of temporary that would cause undefined behavior or unreachable code.\n\n- There are no labels, switch/case constructs, goto statements, or code statements placed after an unconditional return in the shown function that would constitute unreachable code.\n\n- The provided related definitions (the struct, table, token typedef, and return-code macros) do not introduce unreachable code in the shown fragment.\n\nTherefore, based on the supplied code fragments, there are no pieces of code that are statically unreachable and thus nothing to flag for investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1. If there are other files or macros (e.g., OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) with complex conditional compilation or dead branches, those would need to be examined separately."
