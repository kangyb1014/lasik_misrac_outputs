  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are visible in the provided code: the function declaration/definition, pointer usage, assignments, if/return statements, and the call to sem_post(...) are all standard C (sem_post is a POSIX API, not a compiler language extension). The only construct that could conceal a compiler-specific extension is the macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...). Macro expansions can contain compiler-specific extensions (for example GCC/Clang statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, __extension__, or other vendor builtins). Because the macro body is not provided, it must be inspected to verify it does not use any documented compiler language extensions. All other code fragments shown do not use any documented compiler language extensions and therefore do not need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 based on the provided snippet."
