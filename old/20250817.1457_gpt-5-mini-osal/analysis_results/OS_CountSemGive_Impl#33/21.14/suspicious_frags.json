  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp or any string comparison of null-terminated strings are present in the provided code fragments. The function OS_CountSemGive_Impl calls sem_post on a semaphore id and returns OS_SEM_FAILURE or OS_SUCCESS; that does not involve memcmp. The related definitions (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, the token and record types, and the status macros) do not use memcmp or perform string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in the supplied code."
