  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- Execution begins at the first statement and proceeds to the call to OS_ObjectIdGetById; that call can return different values, so it is not a constant conditional that would make subsequent code unreachable.\n- The if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) branch may be either taken or not taken at run time, so the call to OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl is potentially reachable and not dead code.\n- The final return return_code; is reachable on all control paths (both when the if is taken and when it is not).\n- There are no unconditional returns, infinite loops, constant false/true conditions, unreachable labels, or other constructs that would make any statement unreachable.\n\nNote: Potential issues such as use of an uninitialized token when OS_ObjectIdGetById fails are not instances of unreachable code and therefore are not reported under Rule 2.1."
