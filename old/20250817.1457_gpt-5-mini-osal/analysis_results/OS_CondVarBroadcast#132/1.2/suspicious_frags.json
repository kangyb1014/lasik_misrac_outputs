  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragment contains only standard C constructs: typedef-based types, ordinary function definition/return, macros with constant integer values, and normal comments. There are no compiler-specific keywords or extensions present (for example: no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, anonymous structs/unions used as extensions, or other vendor-specific pragma/keywords). The calls and identifiers (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl) are ordinary function calls; the token and integer variables are standard declarations. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
