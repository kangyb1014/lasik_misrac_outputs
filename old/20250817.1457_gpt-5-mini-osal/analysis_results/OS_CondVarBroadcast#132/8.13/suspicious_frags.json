  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer parameters that could be const-qualified. The only pointer occurrences in this function are the two uses of &token passed to other functions, which therefore need investigation to determine whether those functions modify the token (and thus whether the parameter should be a pointer-to-const). Other fragments do not involve pointers that could be const-qualified and so do not require investigation: the function parameter var_id is not a pointer; the local declarations (token and return_code) are ordinary objects, not pointer types; the symbolic constants (OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR) are non-pointer macro arguments; and the return statement simply returns an integer. No other pointer usages are present in this code fragment."
