  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe iterator argument ('matcharg') and the iterator storage ('iter->arg') are plain void* but are only used as read\u2011only context in the match callback (e.g. OS_ForEachFilterCreator casts the ref to OS_creator_filter_t* and only reads its fields). Specifically the assignment iter->arg = matcharg stores a pointer that should be const-qualified (and the match function type OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t should take a const void * for the context). Because these pointers are not const-qualified though they are used only for reading, Rule 8.13 is violated.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_ForEachObjectOfType code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1491.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_ForEachObjectOfType as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ForEachObjectOfType:\n```c\nvoid OS_ForEachObjectOfType(osal_objtype_t idtype, osal_id_t creator_id, OS_ArgCallback_t callback_ptr,\n                            void *callback_arg)\n{\n    OS_object_iter_t    iter;\n    OS_creator_filter_t filter;\n\n    filter.creator_id    = creator_id;\n    filter.user_callback = callback_ptr;\n    filter.user_arg      = callback_arg;\n\n    if (OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit(OS_ForEachFilterCreator, &filter, idtype, &iter) == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry(&iter, OS_ForEachDoCallback);\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_ForEachObjectOfType code.\n",
