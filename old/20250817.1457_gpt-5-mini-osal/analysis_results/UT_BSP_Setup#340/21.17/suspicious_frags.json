  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for this rule because: - All indexed accesses into the ArgV array (including the use of ArgV[1] for the -v option) are guarded by checks on ArgC and by the decrement logic in the loop, so there is an explicit runtime count-based bound check before the code attempts to use additional argv elements. - Pointer increment (++ArgV) is used in a manner consistent with consuming arguments and is controlled by the same ArgC-based loop bookkeeping. - The rest of the function does not call other <string.h> functions that could read past object bounds. Therefore no additional locations appear relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 beyond the listed fragments."
