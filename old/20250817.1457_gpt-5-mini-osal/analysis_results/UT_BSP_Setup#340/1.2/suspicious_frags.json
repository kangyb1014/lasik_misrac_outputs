  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs and standard library functions (memset, strcmp, strtoul). There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler, pragmas that are implementation-specific, designated initializer extensions, or other vendor-specific keywords. The integer typedefs (uint8, uint32) are aliases of standard stdint types and are not language extensions. The pointer declaration (char *const *ArgV) and all pointer/array indexing are valid standard C. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
