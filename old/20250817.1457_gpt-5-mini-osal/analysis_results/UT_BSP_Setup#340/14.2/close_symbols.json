Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must inspect any for loops that appear in the target function or in any function called (directly or indirectly) from the target function and determine whether loop counters or objects used in loop clauses are modified in the loop body or in called functions. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- OS_BSP_GetArgC: direct callee; need its implementation/signature to see if it contains any for loops or side effects that could interact with loop counters in UT_BSP_Setup.\n- OS_BSP_GetArgV: direct callee; its implementation may contain for loops or modify memory pointed to by ArgV (which could be used as loop control), so inspect it.\n- UT_BSP_DoText: direct callee; must be inspected for any for loops or side effects on objects that could serve as loop counters or loop control flags in the calling context.\n- UT_BSP_Lock, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev, OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl, UT_BSP_Unlock, OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: transitive callees of UT_BSP_DoText (from the static call graph). Any for loops inside these functions (or side effects on objects visible to callers) must be checked because MISRA counts the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body.\n- strcmp, strtoul, memset: standard-library functions called in UT_BSP_Setup. Their implementations could contain for loops; at minimum you need their prototypes/semantics and to know they do not modify user loop counters or program objects used as loop counters.\n- BSP_UT_Global (type/definition) and BSP_UT_Global.CurrVerbosity (member): the global modified in UT_BSP_Setup. If a for loop elsewhere uses this object as a loop counter or control flag, you must know its type and whether it can be modified by called functions.\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_NONE, UTASSERT_CASETYPE_DEBUG, UTASSERT_CASETYPE_FAILURE, UTASSERT_CASETYPE_PASS, UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX: enumeration/macros used as values for UserShift and comparisons. Their types and value ranges are needed to determine whether they can be used as loop counters or flags and whether expressions like (2 << UserShift) are well-defined.\n- uint8, uint32, char * const * (ArgV type): typedef/type definitions used in the function. Required to know integer widths, signedness and pointer constness to decide whether operations in loop clauses or increments would be well\u2011formed.\n\nNotes: UT_BSP_Setup contains a while loop (not a for loop) so the immediate function does not present a for\u2011loop to check. However the MISRA requirement includes the behaviour of functions called within a loop body and the possibility that called/transitive functions themselves contain for loops; therefore all direct and transitive callees listed above must be available for inspection, together with the global data and macros used by UT_BSP_Setup, and the relevant standard-library function contracts."
