  "explanation": "All other fragments do not present pointer-to-non-const issues relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter 'buffer' is already declared as 'const void *'; 'filedes', 'nbytes', 'timeout', and 'return_code' are non-pointer scalar types; the macros OS_CHECK_POINTER(buffer) and OS_CHECK_SIZE(nbytes) operate on existing parameters (buffer is const-qualified) and do not introduce additional pointer types to be const-qualified here; the local declarations ('OS_object_token_t token;', 'int32 return_code;') are object definitions, not pointer declarations. The only places where a pointer to a non-const object is passed (and thus merit investigation for possible const-qualification) are the three listed calls that pass '&token'."
