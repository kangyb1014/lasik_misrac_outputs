  "scenario": "The shown function itself does not call any <string.h> functions; it only checks the pointer/size (via macros) and forwards buffer and nbytes to OS_GenericWrite_Impl. As provided, there is no direct use of memcpy/strcpy/etc., so the fragment does not violate Rule 21.17. A concrete violation scenario would be if OS_GenericWrite_Impl (or any called routine) invokes a string.h function (e.g. memcpy or strcpy) using 'buffer' and 'nbytes' without ensuring the object pointed to by 'buffer' is at least 'nbytes' bytes long (for example passing a 10\u2011byte buffer with nbytes==20 into memcpy), which would breach Rule 21.17."
