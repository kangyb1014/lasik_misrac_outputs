  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not involve passing pointer/size pairs to standard string.h routines or performing buffer memory operations and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C Rule 21.17. Specifically: the local variable declarations (OS_object_token_t token; int32 return_code;) do not perform memory accesses; the call to OS_ObjectIdGetById and the subsequent OS_ObjectIdRelease only manage object identifiers and locks (no string.h usage or direct buffer copies in the shown code); and the final return statement simply returns the code. The three flagged fragments are the only points where a user-supplied buffer and length are introduced or forwarded (the function signature and the two checks) and where the buffer/length are passed into an implementation that may use memcpy/memmove/str* functions; these therefore require investigation to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses occur."
