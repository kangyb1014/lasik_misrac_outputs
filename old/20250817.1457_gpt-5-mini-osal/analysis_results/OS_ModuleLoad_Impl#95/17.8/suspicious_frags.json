  "explanation": "No assignments or modifications to the function parameters occur in this function. Specifically:\n\n- Neither token nor translated_path is ever assigned to or changed (no statements like token = ..., translated_path = ..., or pointer arithmetic on them).\n- token is only dereferenced (*token) when passed to the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro to obtain local pointers (impl and module). Dereferencing to read the value does not modify the pointer parameter itself.\n- translated_path is only passed as an argument to dlopen(); the function does not write through that pointer or reassign it.\n- Modifications that do occur (e.g., impl->dl_handle = dlopen(...)) affect objects reached via local pointers derived from the token; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule, provided the pointer variable itself is not changed.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing else in the shown code needs investigation for this rule."
