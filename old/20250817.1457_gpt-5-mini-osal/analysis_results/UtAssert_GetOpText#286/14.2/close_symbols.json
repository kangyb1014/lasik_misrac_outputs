The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n- UtAssert_Compare_t: The function's parameter type. Knowing its definition (enum vs typedef) is required to confirm that the switch labels are simple constant enumerators (no hidden macros or expressions that could expand to code containing a for loop). If UtAssert_Compare_t were defined via a macro or involved complex constructs, that could affect compliance analysis.\n\n- UtAssert_Compare_EQ, UtAssert_Compare_NEQ, UtAssert_Compare_LT, UtAssert_Compare_GT, UtAssert_Compare_LTEQ, UtAssert_Compare_GTEQ, UtAssert_Compare_BITMASK_SET, UtAssert_Compare_BITMASK_UNSET: Each enumerator (or macro constant) used in the switch must be inspected to ensure they are plain integer constants and not macros or constructs that expand to code containing a for loop or other side effects. MISRA\u2019s for-loop rule requires investigating called/used symbols for side effects; a switch label that is actually a macro could hide such effects. Verifying these constants ensures the target function contains only the shown switch and string assignments and no hidden for loops or side effects.\n\nNotes and justification for omissions:\n- The target function contains no for loop and calls no other functions, so there are no called-function behaviours inside a for body to inspect. Therefore no function callees (e.g., UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare, UtAssert_DoCompare, UtAssert_GetValueText) are required to determine whether this function itself violates the MISRA for-loop rule.\n- No other macros or external objects are referenced in the function body; string literals are self-contained and do not affect for-loop formation.\n\nConclusion: Inspecting the typedef/enum for UtAssert_Compare_t and the definitions of the listed enumerators is sufficient to verify that the function source shown does not contain or hide any for loop constructs that could violate the MISRA C for-loop well-formedness rule."
