The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function are necessary for correct behaviour: each switch case assigns OpText and the value is returned, so those assignments are not removable without changing the return value. The break statements are needed to prevent fall-through and thus affect behaviour. The local variable declaration (const char *OpText;) is used and not dead. Comments are non-executable and therefore not candidates. The default case is flagged because the comment \"should never happen\" indicates it may be considered unreachable in normal operation; this block should be investigated to determine if it is actually executed in any configuration (and thus whether it constitutes dead code per Rule 2.2). No other code fragments appear to meet the definition of dead code. "
