  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragment contains only standard C constructs: a function returning const char *, a local pointer variable, a switch statement on an (assumed) enum type UtAssert_Compare_t, standard case labels including a default, string literals, comments, and break statements. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm/__asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, designated initializers with nonstandard syntax, inline assembly, compiler-specific keywords (e.g. __extension__, __builtin_*, __declspec), nonstandard pragmas, or other documented vendor extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
