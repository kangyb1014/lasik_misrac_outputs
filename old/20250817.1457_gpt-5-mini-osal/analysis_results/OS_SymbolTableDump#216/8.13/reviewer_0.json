In that case translated_path (a modifiable char array) is passed as a non-const char *, and the parameter should instead be const char * to reflect it is not modified. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If the implementation actually modifies the buffer, then no violation occurs.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_SymbolTableDump_Log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *fp = NULL;\n    va_list ap;\n\n    /* Try to create the directory if it does not exist.

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s scenario describes a possible MISRA 8.13 violation, but the evidence is insufficient to conclude the shown OS_SymbolTableDump() function itself violates the rule. Explanation:\n\n- Rule 8.13 requires that pointer types be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. That requirement applies to declarations/definitions (the function prototype/definition) rather than the mere act of passing a modifiable char[] as an argument.\n\n- In the provided OS_SymbolTableDump code, translated_path is a modifiable char array and is passed to OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl as a char * (by decay). If OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is actually declared/defined to take a const char * (and does not modify the buffer) then there is no violation. If OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is declared to take a non-const char * but in practice only reads the buffer, then the implementation\u2019s declaration/definition should be changed to take const char * to satisfy MISRA 8.13 \u2014 that would be a legitimate violation of 8.13 in the implementation, not in the caller.\n\n- The caller code shown does not itself violate 8.13 by passing translated_path; the potential violation would be in the prototype/definition of OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl (which is not provided). Therefore Agent A\u2019s claim that \u201cthe following OS_SymbolTableDump code violates MISRA 8.13\u201d is not supported by the supplied code. It is only a correct diagnostic if the unseen implementation/prototype takes a non-const char * yet does not modify the buffer.\n\nRecommendation: inspect the declaration/definition of OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl. If it does not modify the path buffer, change its parameter type to const char * (and update all prototypes) to comply with MISRA 8.13."
