  "explanation": "The function parameter declaration \"const char *filename\" already satisfies Rule 8.13 (pointer to const) and therefore does not require investigation. The local array \"char translated_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\" is a mutable buffer intended to receive data (i.e., it is expected to be written), so it is appropriate that it is not const. The token variable \"OS_object_token_t token;\" is passed by address to initialization/cancellation functions which are expected to modify it, so those &token uses are correctly non-const and need no further inspection. Simple assignments to return_code and the return statements contain no pointer-type issues relevant to Rule 8.13. The selected call sites/macros are reported because they involve passing pointer(s) where the callee signature (macro or function) might accept non-const pointer types even though a const-qualified pointer could be appropriate; these call sites should be inspected to confirm the callee parameter types honor Rule 8.13."
