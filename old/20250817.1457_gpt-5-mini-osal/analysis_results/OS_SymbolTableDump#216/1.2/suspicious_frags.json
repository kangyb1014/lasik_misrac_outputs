  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragments. The code only uses standard C constructs: typedefs (int32 based on int32_t), normal function definitions, standard control flow (if/return), standard comment syntax, macro invocations, and a forward declaration typedef for a struct. The shown macros and constant definitions (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_SUCCESS, OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN) do not themselves reveal any compiler-specific extensions. There are no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, zero-length arrays, anonymous structs/unions (if supported as an extension), __extension__ markers, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 based on the provided code."
