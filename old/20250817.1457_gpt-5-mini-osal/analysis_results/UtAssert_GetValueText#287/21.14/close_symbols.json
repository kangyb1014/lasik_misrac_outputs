  "explanation": "- UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare: This is the (only) caller of UtAssert_GetValueText per the static call graph. Inspecting its implementation is required to see how the returned TempBuf is used (e.g. whether it is later compared as a C string). If the caller passes the returned buffer to a comparison routine that uses memcmp, that would be relevant to the MISRA rule.\n- UtAssert_DoCompare: UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare calls UtAssert_DoCompare; the actual comparison implementation is likely here. You must inspect this symbol to determine whether memcmp is used to compare the formatted value strings produced by UtAssert_GetValueText.\n- UtAssert_GetOpText: Present in the caller's call list; it may influence whether comparisons are done as string comparisons or numeric comparisons. Knowing the selected operation can show whether the code intends a string comparison (which must not use memcmp for null-terminated strings).\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. You must examine any uses of memcmp (its call sites and argument patterns) to decide if it is being used to compare null-terminated strings produced by UtAssert_GetValueText.\n- snprintf: UtAssert_GetValueText uses snprintf to produce the text returned in TempBuf. Confirming snprintf behavior (it writes a NUL terminator when space permits) is necessary to establish that the buffer contains a null-terminated C string; that predicate is needed to decide whether any subsequent use of memcmp constitutes a forbidden comparison of null-terminated strings."
