  "explanation": "No obvious compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The constructs present are standard C features: static/function returning const char*, pointer parameters, size_t (standard, <stddef.h>), UT_IntCheck_t defined as ptrdiff_t (standard), enum type (UtAssert_Radix_t), casts to (long)/(unsigned long), and snprintf with standard printf format specifiers (%lo, %lx, %lu, %ld). The use of bool is a standard C99/_Bool feature (typically via <stdbool.h>); it is not a compiler extension under modern C standards. There are no vendor-specific keywords (for example __attribute__, __declspec, __extension__, asm, or other compiler intrinsics), no GCC/Clang/MSVC-only built-ins, and no other nonstandard syntax that would be documented as a language extension. If the project is being built with a pre-C99 compiler that advertises support for 'bool' or 'snprintf' as a vendor extension, then those specific items should be rechecked against that compiler's documentation; however, based on the code alone and standard C, there are no fragments that require investigation for Rule 1.2."
