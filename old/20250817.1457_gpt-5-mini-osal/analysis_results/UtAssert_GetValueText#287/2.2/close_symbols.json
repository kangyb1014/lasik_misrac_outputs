Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare: This is the only caller of UtAssert_GetValueText (per the call graph). Its implementation is required to see what values for RadixType, IsUnsigned and InValue are actually passed; if some branch values are never passed, those branches in UtAssert_GetValueText would be dead code.\n- UtAssert_Radix_t: The enum/typedef that defines the radix selector is needed to understand the set of possible RadixType values and whether any enumerators are unused by callers (to detect dead branches).\n- UtAssert_Radix_BOOLEAN / UtAssert_Radix_OCTAL / UtAssert_Radix_HEX: The specific enumerator symbols used in the function are needed to determine whether those cases can actually occur at run time (via call-site analysis) and thus whether the corresponding branches are potentially dead.\n- UT_IntCheck_t: The integer type of InValue (and its signedness/width) can affect casts/comparisons and thus whether some code paths (for example the IsUnsigned branch or the boolean test) are meaningful or redundant; its definition is needed to reason about observable behaviour if a branch were removed.\n- snprintf: Although a standard library call, its side effect (writing TempBuf) is the observable effect of each branch. Confirming its semantics (that it only writes the buffer and returns formatted output) is necessary to evaluate whether removing a branch would change program behaviour.\n\nNote: The above symbols (caller + types/enumerators + output routine) are sufficient to determine whether any branch in UtAssert_GetValueText is unreachable/unused at run time and therefore constitutes dead code under the MISRA rule."
