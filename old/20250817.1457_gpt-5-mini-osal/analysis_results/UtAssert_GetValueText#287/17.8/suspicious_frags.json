  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying a function parameter itself (reassigning the pointer parameter), but permits modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter. In this function: the pointer parameter TempBuf is never reassigned and no other parameter (TempSz, InValue, IsUnsigned, RadixType) is modified. The only mutations are writes into the object pointed to by TempBuf via snprintf, which is allowed by the rule. Returning TempBuf as a const char * does not modify the parameter. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
