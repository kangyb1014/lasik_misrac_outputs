  "explanation": "snprintf: The function writes to TempBuf and its safety depends on snprintf semantics (it must not write beyond the supplied size). We need the snprintf prototype/behavior to know it constrains writes to TempSz and how it reports required buffer size. UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare: This caller constructs/passes TempBuf and TempSz; its implementation (and any buffers it uses) is required to determine the actual buffer bounds and whether the size passed is sufficient for all format outcomes. TempBuf (caller's allocation): The actual pointer and how/where the buffer is allocated determine the object bounds; without this the TempSz limit cannot be checked against real memory. TempSz (value passed by callers): The numeric size passed to snprintf is the primary bound used; we must know its value(s) to determine possible out-of-bounds access. UT_IntCheck_t (typedef / width / signedness): The printed textual length depends on the magnitude and signedness/width of InValue; also casts to (long)/(unsigned long) must be valid. Knowing UT_IntCheck_t lets us reason about maximum characters produced for numeric conversions. UtAssert_Radix_t and enum constants (BOOLEAN, OCTAL, HEX): These control which format string is chosen (\"true\"/\"false\", \"0%lo\", \"0x%lx\", \"%lu\", \"%ld\"); to bound output length we must consider each branch and its prefix/format. size_t (typedef): Needed to reason about TempSz semantics and comparisons with potential output lengths. Platform/C standard specification of snprintf (C99/C11 behavior): To conclude safety under MISRA's bounds rule we must rely on the precise contract of snprintf on the target platform (that it does not write beyond TempSz and how it truncates/returns required length). Additionally, to fully assess undefined-behavior risks that could affect buffer writes, we need to confirm that casting UT_IntCheck_t to (long)/(unsigned long) and supplying those to the specified format specifiers is valid on the target platform (requires knowledge of integer widths/ABI)."
