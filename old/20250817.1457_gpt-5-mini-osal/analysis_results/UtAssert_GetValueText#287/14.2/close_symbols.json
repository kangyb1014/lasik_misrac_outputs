The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Brief justification for each symbol (why it is required to decide compliance with the MISRA \"for loop shall be well-formed\" rule):\n\n1) UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare\n   - This function is the caller of UtAssert_GetValueText (per static call graph). If GenericIntegerCompare contains a for loop that calls GetValueText in its body, the behaviour of GetValueText is part of that loop body for MISRA analysis. We need the code of GenericIntegerCompare to determine whether any for loop there is well-formed and whether calling GetValueText within it introduces persistent side effects or modifies loop counters.\n\n2) UtAssert_DoCompare\n   - UtAssert_DoCompare is called by UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare. If GenericIntegerCompare's for loop calls DoCompare (directly or indirectly) or if DoCompare is invoked within the same loop context, its behaviour must be included in the loop-body analysis. We need its implementation to see whether it modifies objects used as loop counters or has persistent side effects.\n\n3) UtAssert_GetOpText\n   - Also called by UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare. As with DoCompare, if GetOpText is executed inside a loop in the caller, its behaviour contributes to the loop body and must be checked for side effects or loop-counter modifications.\n\n4) snprintf\n   - UtAssert_GetValueText calls snprintf. To reason about side effects of GetValueText when used inside a loop body, we must know whether snprintf (or its project-specific wrapper) has any persistent side effects beyond writing to the provided buffer (for example, global state changes). At minimum we need its prototype/behavior to confirm it does not modify loop counters or other objects used in loop clauses.\n\n5) UT_IntCheck_t\n   - The integer type of the InValue parameter. Its signedness, width, or typedef may affect casts and value semantics; if loop counters or objects in the caller loop are of related types, we must know whether conversions in GetValueText could alter those objects or cause side effects relevant to the for-loop rule.\n\n6) UtAssert_Radix_t\n   - The enum/type controlling branching in GetValueText. Its definition and possible values are necessary to understand all control-flow paths (which determine which calls to snprintf and casts occur) when the function is executed inside a loop.\n\n7) UtAssert_Radix_BOOLEAN\n8) UtAssert_Radix_OCTAL\n9) UtAssert_Radix_HEX\n   - The specific enum constants used in the target function's branching. Knowing these values (and whether any are macros with side effects) clarifies which branch is taken and whether any branch could introduce side effects that affect loop formation rules.\n\n10) bool\n   - The boolean type used by the IsUnsigned parameter. Its definition (e.g., stdbool.h or project typedef) is required to ensure it is a plain boolean identifier and that no unusual semantics or macros alter behaviour relevant to loop analysis.\n\n11) size_t\n   - Used for TempSz; knowing its definition/prototype is necessary to confirm casts or side effects do not impact loop counters or objects used by enclosing loops.\n\nSummary: The top priority symbols are the caller UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare and its callees (UtAssert_DoCompare, UtAssert_GetOpText) because the MISRA rule explicitly requires including the behaviour of functions called within a for-loop body. The remaining symbols are the types, constants, and library function (snprintf) used by UtAssert_GetValueText so the analyzer can determine whether GetValueText itself has side effects that could invalidate the well-formedness of an enclosing for loop (e.g., modifies loop counters or other objects used in loop clauses)."
