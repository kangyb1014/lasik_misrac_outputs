  "explanation": "- UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare: This is the only caller shown in the call graph. You must inspect its implementation/use of the returned const char * to determine whether the return value is later modified or passed to APIs that require a non-const char *. That usage determines whether returning const char * is appropriate and whether TempBuf could/should be declared const.\n- snprintf (from <stdio.h>): Confirms that the function writes into TempBuf. Because snprintf writes into the buffer, TempBuf cannot be a pointer-to-const object; this symbol proves TempBuf must be a writable char * parameter.\n- UT_IntCheck_t: The typedef for InValue must be known to ensure it is not a pointer type (which could change const-qualification requirements). If UT_IntCheck_t were a pointer type, MISRA const rules could apply to it; if it is an integer type then no pointer constification is relevant.\n- UtAssert_Radix_t and the constants UtAssert_Radix_BOOLEAN / UtAssert_Radix_OCTAL / UtAssert_Radix_HEX: Knowing whether RadixType is an enum or some other type (and that these constants are values, not pointers) confirms there are no hidden pointer parameters that could/should be const-qualified.\n- size_t (typedef): Confirms TempSz is an integer type, not a pointer type; ensures no pointer const-qualification is required for that parameter.\n- bool (typedef): Confirms IsUnsigned is not a pointer type; verifies there are no pointer parameters omitted from the snippet that might require const qualification.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyzer determine (1) which parameters are actually pointers that could be const-qualified, (2) which of those pointers are modified by this function (snprintf -> TempBuf is modified), and (3) how the returned const char * is used by the caller (UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare), which is necessary to decide whether the chosen const qualification on the return and parameter is consistent with MISRA guidance."
