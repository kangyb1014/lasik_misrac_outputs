  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in OS_SocketBindAddress that modify any of the function parameters (sock_id or Addr). Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to the parameters (no statements like \"Addr = ...;\" or \"sock_id = ...;\").\n- There are no increments/decrements or pointer arithmetic applied to Addr.\n- The OS_CHECK_POINTER(Addr) macro expands to BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL, ...), which only tests Addr for NULL and does not assign to it.\n- Calls that take Addr (OS_SocketBindAddress_Impl(&token, Addr) and OS_CreateSocketName(&token, Addr, NULL)) pass the pointer by value; they cannot modify the Addr variable in this function. Modification of the object referred to by Addr would be performed in those callee functions (and is allowable under the rule), but such modification would need to be checked inside those functions themselves.\n- Passing &token and subsequent changes to record/stream modify local objects, not the incoming parameters.\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8; no further investigation of fragments inside this function is required for that rule. If needed, the callee functions (OS_SocketBindAddress_Impl and OS_CreateSocketName) should be inspected separately to ensure they do not modify their pointer-parameter variables contrary to Rule 17.8."
