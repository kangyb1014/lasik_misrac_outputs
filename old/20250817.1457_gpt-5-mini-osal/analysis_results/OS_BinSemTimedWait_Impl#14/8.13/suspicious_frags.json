  "explanation": "The suspicious fragments above are the only places in this function where an object\u2019s address is taken or a pointer is involved and thus may require checking for const qualification. Other code fragments do not need investigation under Rule 8.13: the parameter declaration 'const OS_object_token_t *token' is already const-qualified; 'uint32 msecs' is not a pointer; the function signature and comments contain no additional pointer usage. Therefore no other parts of this function are relevant to Rule 8.13."
