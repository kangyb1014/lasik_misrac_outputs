  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment declares a local struct object (struct timespec ts;) and does not declare any pointer. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and their const qualification, so this fragment does not violate the rule. (Note: if the called functions take non-const pointers but do not modify the object, those function parameter types \u2014 not this declaration \u2014 could be examined for possible Rule 8.13 issues.)"
