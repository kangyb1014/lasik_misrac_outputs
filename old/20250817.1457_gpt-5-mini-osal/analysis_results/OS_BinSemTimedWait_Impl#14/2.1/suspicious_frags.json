  "explanation": "The remainder of the function contains no conditionals, loops, gotos, multiple returns, or other control-flow constructs that could create unreachable code: the variable declaration, comment block, and the function prologue/epilogue are straightforward and executed/placed normally. Any potential unreachable-code violation in this function would arise only from the behavior of the called routines (which is why their call sites are reported). No other fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 2.1."
