  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The parameters are: (1) token \u2014 declared as const OS_object_token_t *token and only forwarded to OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl; there is no assignment, pointer arithmetic, or reassignment of token within this function. (2) msecs \u2014 passed by value to OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime and not assigned to or altered locally. The only local pointer used is &ts (address of a local struct timespec), which is permitted to be modified by callee functions; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed by the rule, but the pointer itself must not be changed \u2014 which does not occur here. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this code."
