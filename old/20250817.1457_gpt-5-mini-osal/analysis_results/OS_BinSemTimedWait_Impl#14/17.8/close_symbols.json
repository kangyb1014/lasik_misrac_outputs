  "explanation": "- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl (function prototype/declaration): Needed to know the exact parameter types for the call OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl(token, &ts). In particular, the prototype shows whether the function expects a pointer-to-token, a pointer-to-pointer, or has any casts in its declaration. This verifies that the target function does not modify its own parameter variable 'token' (the MISRA rule forbids modifying the parameter itself). Also confirms that passing a const pointer is type-correct and whether any implicit cast could indicate a pointer-level modification concern.\n\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime (function prototype/declaration): Needed to check the parameter types for OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime(msecs, &ts). Although msecs is passed by value (so cannot be modified in the caller), having the prototype ensures there is no surprising signature (e.g. taking a pointer to msecs) that would imply the caller's parameter could be altered by address passing.\n\n- OS_object_token_t (typedef/struct definition): Required to determine what 'const OS_object_token_t *token' actually means (is OS_object_token_t itself a pointer type, an array, or a struct?). This clarifies whether 'token' is a pointer variable that could be modified in the function, or whether the declaration hides additional indirection that affects the MISRA analysis.\n\n- uint32 (typedef): To confirm that 'msecs' is indeed a scalar passed by value (not e.g. a macro/type that expands to a pointer). This rules out the possibility that the apparent-by-value parameter is actually an alias for a pointer and thus could be modified.\n\n- struct timespec (definition): To confirm that &ts is the address of a local object and that taking its address does not involve the function parameters. This is to show that no parameter is being reassigned to point at ts or otherwise modified."
