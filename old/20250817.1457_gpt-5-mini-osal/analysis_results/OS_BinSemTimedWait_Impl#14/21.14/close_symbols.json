  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl (or any of its callees) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime: This is a direct callee of the target function. Even though it appears to deal with time, its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not (unexpectedly) call memcmp on strings.\n\n- OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl: This is the other direct callee and the most likely place for string comparisons related to the token argument. Its implementation must be examined to find any memcmp uses or wrappers that compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Called by OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl (per the call graph). This function is the prime candidate to inspect for comparisons involving object tokens or names; it may compare token fields (which could be null\u2011terminated strings) and thus may call memcmp.\n\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: Also called by OS_GenericBinSemTake_Impl. Its body must be checked in case it performs any string comparisons (directly or via helpers) that could use memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- OS_object_token_t (type definition): The target function accepts a const OS_object_token_t *; inspecting the type is essential to know whether fields within the token are null\u2011terminated strings (e.g., name pointers) so that any memcmp use on those fields can be judged against the MISRA rule.\n\n- memcmp (standard library symbol): The analysis must find any uses of memcmp (direct or indirect) in the above functions. If memcmp is used, the call sites must be inspected to see whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings (which would violate the rule) or used correctly with explicit lengths or on non\u2011string binary data.\n\nTogether, these symbols let the next agent trace any memcmp usage reachable from OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl and determine whether such uses violate the MISRA restriction."
