  "explanation": "No language extensions are used in the provided function. The fragment contains a standard C function definition, a local variable declaration of struct timespec (a POSIX type, which is a library/API feature rather than a compiler language extension), calls to other functions, and a return statement. There are no compiler-specific keywords or identifiers (no identifiers beginning with __), no __attribute__ usages, no inline assembly, no nested functions, no typeof, no statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, no designated initializers with nonstandard syntax, and no other constructs that are documented as compiler extensions. The use of parentheses around the return expression and the typedef-like int32/OS_object_token_t are standard C usage or project typedefs, not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
