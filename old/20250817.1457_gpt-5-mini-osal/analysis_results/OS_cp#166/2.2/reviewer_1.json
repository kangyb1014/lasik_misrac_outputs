  "explanation": "The claim is not provably correct from the code shown. Whether the explicit initialization file1 = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED; is dead depends on the contract/implementation of OS_OpenCreate. If OS_OpenCreate is guaranteed to write to *filedes on every code path (success or failure) then the prior assignment is redundant; however that guarantee is not present in the posted code or demonstrated by the agent. Removing the initialization could change behaviour if OS_OpenCreate ever fails to set file1 (leaving it indeterminate) because later code calls OS_ObjectIdDefined(file1) and may call OS_close(file1). The explicit initialization is therefore a defensive initialization that prevents use of an indeterminate value and helps static analysis tools. To justify a Rule 2.2 violation the reporter must show (project\u2011wide) that the assignment has no effect on program behaviour (for example by inspecting the implementation or API contract of OS_OpenCreate). Because that evidence is not provided, the report is not correct."
