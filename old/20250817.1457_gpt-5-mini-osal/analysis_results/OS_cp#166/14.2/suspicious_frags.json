First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to the formation of for loops (the three clauses and the loop counter restrictions). The code only contains while loops (while (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) and while (wr_total < rd_size)), so there are no for-loop clauses, loop counters in for statements, or for-loop third-clause modifications to inspect. Therefore, there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 14.2. Other constructs (the while loops and function calls) are outside the scope of this specific rule and need not be examined for compliance with Rule 14.2."
