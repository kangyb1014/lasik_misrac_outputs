  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not introduce pointer types that could/should be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Specifically:\n- The function parameters src and dest are already declared as const char * in the function signature (so their declaration conforms to the rule).\n- The local buffer copyblock is a mutable uint8 array used as a read/write buffer; it must be modifiable by OS_read, so it cannot be const-qualified here.\n- file1 and file2 are identifier variables (osal_id_t) and are not pointer types; their usage (including passing their addresses to OS_OpenCreate) represents output parameters and thus must be non-const.\n- Control-flow constructs (while loops, if/else, break) and simple integer variables (return_code, rd_size, wr_size, wr_total) do not involve pointer-to-object declarations and are therefore irrelevant to Rule 8.13.\n\nThe listed fragments are the call sites where pointer arguments cross API boundaries (macros/functions). Those call sites should be examined to ensure the target API parameter types use const qualifiers where appropriate (for example, whether OS_write/OS_OpenCreate/OS_CHECK_POINTER accept const-qualified pointer types). No other parts of the function introduce additional pointer targets that could be made const."
