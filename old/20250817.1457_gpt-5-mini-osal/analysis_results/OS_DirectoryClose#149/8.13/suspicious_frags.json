  "explanation": "I flagged every place in this function where the address of the local token object (&token) is passed to another routine, because those pointer parameters might be candidates for const-qualification and therefore should be inspected. Other parts of the function were not flagged because they do not involve pointer parameters that could be const-qualified: the function signature and the scalar parameters/return (dir_id, return_code), and the local declaration of token (OS_object_token_t token;) are not pointer objects and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13. No other pointer usages appear in this snippet that would need investigation."
