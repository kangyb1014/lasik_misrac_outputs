  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related typedefs for use of compiler-specific language extensions. I found none. Specifically:\n\n- No GCC/Clang-specific keywords or constructs are present (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or asm volatile blocks).\n- No C++ language features are used (no classes, references, function overloading, new/delete, extern \"C\", etc.).\n- No compiler-specific pragmas or #pragma directives appear in the fragment.\n- All identifiers and typedefs shown (osal_id_t as uint32, int32 as int32_t, OS_SUCCESS macro) are standard C types/macros or project typedefs; nothing indicates a compiler extension.\n- Control flow and declarations (local variables, function calls, return statements, comments) conform to standard C syntax.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that appear to use language compiler extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
