  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. Reasons by fragment/category:\n\n- Pointer assignment from void*: \"const uint8 *MemByte = Memory;\" \u2014 implicit conversion from void* to object pointer is standard C (C89/C99 semantics for void*); not a compiler extension.\n\n- Use of fixed-width integer typedefs: uint8 and uint32 are typedefs for uint8_t and uint32_t (standard C stdint.h); this is standard, not an extension.\n\n- Use of bool and boolean literals: the function return type and variable \"bool Success\" are standard C boolean support (stdbool.h in C99), not an extension.\n\n- Variadic macro usage: the shown macro UtAssert_True using __VA_ARGS__ is a standard C99 variadic-macro feature, not a compiler extension.\n\n- Standard library calls and idioms: fopen, fgetc, fclose, printf, strerror, errno are standard C library usage; the for-loop containing an assignment in the condition ((FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) is standard C expression usage, not an extension.\n\n- Explicit casts in printf arguments (unsigned long, unsigned int) are standard C casts to match format specifiers; no compiler-specific format specifiers or attributes are used.\n\n- No vendor-specific keywords or attributes are present (no __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __int128, pragmas that are compiler-specific, or other double-underscore compiler intrinsics).\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that invoke documented compiler language extensions; therefore nothing needs to be flagged for Rule 1.2 investigation."
