  "explanation": "For determining whether UtMem2BinFileCmp uses any compiler language extensions (per the MISRA rule), the analyzer must know the definitions and/or declarations of the following symbols because they can hide non\u2011standard or implementation\u2011specific constructs:\n\n- uint8\n  - Reason: This is not a standard C type name (standard is uint8_t). The typedef/definition may be a simple alias (unsigned char) or a compiler/SDK extension. Need the typedef to determine if it relies on an extension.\n\n- uint32\n  - Reason: Not a standard C keyword (standard is uint32_t). Its underlying type (e.g., unsigned long, unsigned int, or a compiler-specific width type) affects whether non\u2011standard typedefs or attributes are used.\n\n- bool\n  - Reason: Could be the standard _Bool/boolean from <stdbool.h> or a custom macro/typedef. A custom definition might be a language extension or use compiler-specific features; need to confirm.\n\n- FILE\n  - Reason: A standard library type, but its declaration (from the C library/header) must be the standard one. If the project substitutes a custom FILE type (or uses a compiler-supplied nonstandard stream type), that could be an extension.\n\n- EOF\n  - Reason: Standard macro; verify it comes from the standard headers and is not redefined as a nonstandard value or extension.\n\n- fopen\n  - Reason: Standard library function. Need its declaration to ensure no project-specific replacement or macro uses compiler extensions.\n\n- fgetc\n  - Reason: Standard library function used in the conditional expression. Need its declaration/implementation context to ensure no macro/extension is used.\n\n- fclose\n  - Reason: Standard library function. Confirm no nonstandard replacement or extension is used.\n\n- printf\n  - Reason: Standard I/O function; its use with format specifiers (%lu, %u) must be checked against the actual underlying types (e.g., uint32) to ensure format/type consistency. Also check if printf has been replaced by a macro or nonstandard implementation.\n\n- strerror\n  - Reason: Standard library function. Confirm no project-specific macro/extension replacing it.\n\n- errno\n  - Reason: Standard macro/extern in errno.h; some implementations expose errno as a macro that may expand to thread-local or extension constructs. Confirm whether errno uses any implementation-specific extension (e.g., function\u2011like macro, TLS accessors).\n\n- UtAssert_True\n  - Reason: Called in the else branch. Often implemented as a macro wrapper around assertion machinery; such macros frequently use compiler-specific extensions (statement expressions, __FILE__/__LINE__ usage, attributes). Need its definition to ensure it does not employ language extensions.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext\n  - Reason: Appears in the static call graph (and often used by UtAssert macros). Its declaration/definition may reveal whether the test harness uses nonstandard constructs or macros that expand to extensions.\n\nNotes:\n- The primary goal is to verify whether any of the above symbols are implemented via compiler extensions (nonstandard keywords, builtins, attributes, statement expressions, nonstandard calling conventions, or macros that rely on extensions). If the typedefs/macros for uint8/uint32/bool or the UtAssert_* macros use such constructs, that would be a MISRA violation under the stated rule. The standard library functions/types are included to confirm they are the standard definitions and not replaced by project-specific, extension-using equivalents.\n\n- The analyzer should inspect the typedefs/headers that define these symbols (project headers and any included vendor/compiler headers) to determine the presence of explicit compiler-documented language extensions."
