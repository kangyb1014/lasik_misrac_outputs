  "explanation": "Brief reasons each symbol is needed to check the MISRA rule (pointer should point to const-qualified type whenever possible):\n\n- uint8: Need the typedef/definition to know the underlying object type (e.g. unsigned char) so we can judge whether a pointer-to-uint8 should be const-qualified and whether the assignment from the parameter preserves constness.\n\n- uint32: Included to fully understand the local integer types used (i) and whether any implicit conversions interact with pointer use (helps full type-context analysis).\n\n- FILE: Definition/type of FILE is required to check prototypes of stdio functions (fopen/fgetc/fclose) and to determine whether any pointer-to-FILE constness is expected or violated.\n\n- fopen: Prototype required to verify the parameter type for Filename (typically const char *). This determines whether passing Filename (const char *) complies with the rule or hides a const-qualification mismatch.\n\n- fgetc: Prototype required to confirm the expected argument type (FILE *) and return type (int). Knowing its signature is necessary to see if any pointer constness issues arise when calling it with the FILE * from fopen.\n\n- fclose: Prototype required to verify it accepts FILE * (non-const) and to ensure use of the FILE pointer does not require a const qualification.\n\n- EOF: Macro/constant needed to understand the loop condition and fgetc interaction (not a pointer per se, but included to reason about control flow together with fgetc return type).\n\n- printf: Prototype (signature) is needed because variadic arguments and %s expect a char *-style argument; we must check whether passing const char * (Filename, string literals, or strerror() result) violates the rule or requires casts.\n\n- strerror: Prototype/return type required because it typically returns char * (non-const). Passing its result to printf or using it where a const char * might be preferable is relevant to the const-pointer rule.\n\n- errno: Declaration/type required to confirm correct use with strerror and to check if any const qualification expectations arise from its use.\n\n- UtAssert_True: Prototype (signature) is required because it is called with a string literal (const char *). If UtAssert_True accepts a non-const char * message parameter, that is a potential const-qualification violation under MISRA and must be detected.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: The static call graph shows this as a callee of the target (likely via UtAssert_True/macros). Its declaration is needed if it takes or returns pointer types that might affect const qualifications propagated through the assert call chain.\n\nThese symbols provide the type/prototype context for all pointers passed into or derived inside UtMem2BinFileCmp so an analyzer can determine whether any pointer should have been declared to point to a const-qualified type (or if a non-const parameter is being passed a const object), per the MISRA rule."
