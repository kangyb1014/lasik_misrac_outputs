  "explanation": "I did not include other pointer occurrences because they already use const or cannot reasonably be const: the parameters 'const void *Memory' and 'const char *Filename' are already const-qualified; 'const uint8 *MemByte = Memory;' is const-qualified; the FILE API (fopen, fgetc, fclose) requires a mutable FILE * (so declaring fp as const FILE * would be incompatible with these standard functions); and strerror has a prototype that returns char * (the implementation does not provide a const-qualified return), so although the returned string is only read here it cannot be made const without a local cast/assignment. Therefore only the shown fragments (declaration/assignment of the FILE pointer and the direct use of strerror(errno) in printf) warrant investigation for Rule 8.13 compliance."
