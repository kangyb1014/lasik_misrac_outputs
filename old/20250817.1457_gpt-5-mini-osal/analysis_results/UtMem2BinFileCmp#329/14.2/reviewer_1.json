First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. .\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of UtMem2BinFileCmp.\n```c\nbool UtMem2BinFileCmp(const void *Memory, const char *Filename)\n{\n    FILE *       fp;\n    const uint8 *MemByte = Memory;\n    int          FileByte;\n    bool         Success;\n    uint32       i;\n\n    Success = true;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        for (i = 0; (FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF; i++)\n        {\n            if (MemByte[i] != FileByte)\n            {\n                Success = false;\n                printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Miscompare in file: %s, byte offset: %lu, expected: %u, found: %u\\n\",\n                       Filename, (unsigned long)i, (unsigned int)MemByte[i], (unsigned int)FileByte);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Success = false;\n        printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n        UtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File\");\n    }\n\n    return Success;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:Violation: the for-loop\u2019s second clause ((FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) has a persistent side effect (the call to fgetc and the assignment to FileByte). Rule 14.2 requires the second clause to have no persistent side effects and to use only the loop counter and optional loop-control flags; using a function call that modifies the stream and performing an assignment in the condition breaches that requirement.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void LogPrintf(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *lf = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2636.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!lf)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(lf, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n    fprintf(lf, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(lf);\n}\n\nbool UtMem2BinFileCmp(const void *Memory, const char *Filename)\n{\n    FILE *       fp;\n    const uint8 *MemByte = Memory;\n    int          FileByte;\n    bool         Success;\n    uint32       i;\n    bool         loop_broken = false; /* probe: indicate if loop terminated via break */\n\n    /* Log entry and inputs */\n    LogPrintf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: ENTRY - Memory=%p, Filename=%s\", Memory, Filename ?

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The for statement is not well-formed under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 because its second clause ((FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) has persistent side effects and modifies an object other than the loop counter. Specifically, fgetc(fp) advances/modifies the FILE stream state (a persistent side effect) and the assignment stores into FileByte (an object that is used in the loop body). Rule 14.2 requires the second clause to have no persistent side effects and to use only the loop counter and optional loop-control flag(s). To fix this, perform the input operation in the loop body (for example use for (i = 0; ; i++) { FileByte = fgetc(fp); if (FileByte == EOF) break; ... } ) or use a while loop where the side-effecting read is inside the body."
