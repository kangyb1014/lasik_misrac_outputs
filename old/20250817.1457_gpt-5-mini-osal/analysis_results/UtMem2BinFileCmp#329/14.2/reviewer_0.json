First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. .\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of UtMem2BinFileCmp.\n```c\nbool UtMem2BinFileCmp(const void *Memory, const char *Filename)\n{\n    FILE *       fp;\n    const uint8 *MemByte = Memory;\n    int          FileByte;\n    bool         Success;\n    uint32       i;\n\n    Success = true;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        for (i = 0; (FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF; i++)\n        {\n            if (MemByte[i] != FileByte)\n            {\n                Success = false;\n                printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Miscompare in file: %s, byte offset: %lu, expected: %u, found: %u\\n\",\n                       Filename, (unsigned long)i, (unsigned int)MemByte[i], (unsigned int)FileByte);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Success = false;\n        printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n        UtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File\");\n    }\n\n    return Success;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The for-loop second clause '(FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF' performs an assignment and a function call with persistent side effects and does not use the loop counter. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 (clause 2): the second clause must have no persistent side effects and should use the loop counter (or an optional loop-control flag) only. The assignment to FileByte and the call to fgetc(fp) therefore make the for loop not well-formed under Rule 14.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void UtProbeLog(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    va_list ap;\n    FILE *lf = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2636.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (lf == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging file can't be opened, fallback to stderr to avoid losing evidence. */\n        va_start(ap, fmt);\n        vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);\n        va_end(ap);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(lf, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n    fclose(lf);\n}\nstatic int UtLogFgetc(FILE *fp)\n{\n    int c = fgetc(fp);\n    UtProbeLog(\"UtLogFgetc: fgetc(fp) -> %d (0x%X)\\n\", c, (unsigned int)c);\n    return c;\n}\n\nbool UtMem2BinFileCmp(const void *Memory, const char *Filename)\n{\n    FILE *fp;\n    const unsigned char *MemByte = (const unsigned char *)Memory;\n    int FileByte;\n    bool Success;\n    unsigned long i;\n\n    UtProbeLog(\"Enter UtMem2BinFileCmp: Filename=%s Memory=%p\\n\", Filename, Memory);\n\n    Success = true;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        UtProbeLog(\"Opened file '%s' successfully (fp=%p)\\n\", Filename, (void *)fp);\n\n        /*\n         * Note: the second clause intentionally calls UtLogFgetc and assigns into FileByte\n         * to reproduce the scenario where the second clause has persistent side effects.\n         */\n        for (i = 0; (FileByte = UtLogFgetc(fp)) != EOF; i++)\n        {\n            UtProbeLog(\"Loop enter: i=%lu FileByte=%d MemByte[i]=%u\\n\", i, FileByte, (unsigned int)MemByte[i]);\n\n            if (MemByte[i] != (unsigned char)FileByte)\n            {\n                Success = false;\n\n                /* Log the miscompare to the probe log as evidence. */\n                UtProbeLog(\"Mismatch: file=%s offset=%lu expected=%u found=%u\\n\",\n                           Filename, i, (unsigned int)MemByte[i], (unsigned int)FileByte);\n\n                /* Preserve original behavior: print to stdout and break. */\n                printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Miscompare in file: %s, byte offset: %lu, expected: %u, found: %u\\n\",\n                       Filename, (unsigned long)i, (unsigned int)MemByte[i], (unsigned int)FileByte);\n\n                UtProbeLog(\"Breaking out of loop at i=%lu due to mismatch\\n\", i);\n                break;\n            }\n\n            UtProbeLog(\"Loop exit/iteration end: i=%lu\\n\", i);\n        }\n\n        /* After loop, log the final FileByte and loop index to capture the final evaluation (including EOF). */\n        UtProbeLog(\"After loop: final FileByte=%d i=%lu Success=%d\\n\", FileByte, i, Success ? 1 : 0);\n\n        fclose(fp);\n        UtProbeLog(\"Closed file '%s' (fp=%p)\\n\", Filename, (void *)fp);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Success = false;\n        UtProbeLog(\"Error Opening File: %s errno=%d (%s)\\n\", Filename, errno, strerror(errno));\n        printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n        UtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File\");\n    }\n\n    UtProbeLog(\"Exit UtMem2BinFileCmp: Filename=%s Success=%d\\n\", Filename, Success ? 1 : 0);\n    return Success;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for UtMem2BinFileCmp.

  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 requires the second clause of a for statement to have no persistent side effects and to use the loop counter (or an optional loop-control flag). In the code the second clause '(FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF' both performs an assignment to FileByte and calls fgetc(fp) (which advances the file position \u2014 a persistent side effect). It also does not use the loop counter i. Per the rule (and the rule's note that behaviour of functions called in the controlling expressions is part of the loop behaviour), this form violates clause 2 of Rule 14.2. (The provided UtLogFgetc probe simply demonstrates the side effect but does not affect the correctness of the diagnosis.)"
