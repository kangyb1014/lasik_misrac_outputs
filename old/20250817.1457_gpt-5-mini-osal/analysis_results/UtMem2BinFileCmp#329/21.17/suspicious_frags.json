  "explanation": "No calls to the standard <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in UtMem2BinFileCmp. The function uses fopen, fgetc, fclose, printf and strerror. Although strerror is declared in <string.h> on some platforms, it takes an int and returns a pointer \u2014 it does not accept a pointer parameter that could cause an out-of-bounds access as described by Rule 21.17. Indexing of MemByte (MemByte[i]) and passing Filename to printf(\"%s\") are potential runtime risks (buffer overruns or non-terminated strings) but are not uses of <string.h> functions with pointer parameters and therefore fall outside the scope of Rule 21.17. For the purposes of this rule, there are no code fragments that need investigation."
