  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- uint8, uint32: typedef definitions determine element size and indexing semantics of MemByte[i] and loop counter width. To judge out-of-bounds access you must know the element size and whether indexing arithmetic could overflow.\n\n- FILE, fopen, fgetc, fclose, EOF: fgetc-driven loop termination and return semantics are central to whether the code reads until file end safely. Knowing fgetc signature (returns int, EOF sentinel) and when fclose is called is required to reason about the loop and whether MemByte indexing can run past the buffer because the file is longer than the buffer.\n\n- errno, strerror: strerror is a (standard-library) string function used here. Although strerror takes an int and returns a const char * (it does not read caller-supplied char buffers), include it to confirm that no string.h function is invoked with a caller-supplied pointer that could access out of bounds.\n\n- printf: printf with %s is used with Filename. printf reads a C NUL-terminated string \u2014 to determine any potential out-of-bounds reads you must know the provenance and termination guarantee of Filename.\n\n- UtAssert_True, UtAssert_GetContext: these test-framework routines are invoked on file-open error and may themselves call string-handling library functions (e.g., to build messages). Their implementations/prototypes are needed to check whether they introduce any string.h usage with caller-supplied pointers that could violate the rule.\n\n- call-sites that allocate/initialize the Memory buffer (functions that pass the Memory pointer to UtMem2BinFileCmp): The target function receives a void *Memory with no size parameter. To determine whether indexing MemByte[i] can access beyond the object bounds you must inspect the code that allocates/initializes Memory (its size and lifetime). Without the caller allocation/prototype you cannot conclude compliance.\n\n- call-sites that construct/pass the Filename (provenance of the filename string, e.g., UtMem2BinFile/UtBinFile2Mem/UtMem2HexFile): Whether Filename is a properly NUL-terminated C string (required by printf and strerror usage) depends on where it comes from. Inspecting caller(s) that supply Filename is necessary to determine if any string-handling function in this flow could read past an object bound.\n\nIn short: to show compliance with the MISRA string.h-bounds rule you need the basic type and stdio/errno/string function definitions used here plus the caller-side code that supplies the two unconstrained pointer parameters (Memory and Filename) and the implementations of the test-framework helpers that this function invokes."
