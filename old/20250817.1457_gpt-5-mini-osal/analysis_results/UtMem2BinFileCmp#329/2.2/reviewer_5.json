Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of UtMem2BinFileCmp.\n```c\nbool UtMem2BinFileCmp(const void *Memory, const char *Filename)\n{\n    FILE *       fp;\n    const uint8 *MemByte = Memory;\n    int          FileByte;\n    bool         Success;\n    uint32       i;\n\n    Success = true;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        for (i = 0; (FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF; i++)\n        {\n            if (MemByte[i] != FileByte)\n            {\n                Success = false;\n                printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Miscompare in file: %s, byte offset: %lu, expected: %u, found: %u\\n\",\n                       Filename, (unsigned long)i, (unsigned int)MemByte[i], (unsigned int)FileByte);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Success = false;\n        printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n        UtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File\");\n    }\n\n    return Success;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:If UtAssert_True(false, ...) always terminates execution (for example it calls exit/abort/longjmp and does not return), then the assignment 'Success = false;' in the else branch is executed but has no effect on observable program behaviour (the program will terminate in UtAssert_True before the function return is used). In that case the assignment is dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Whether this is a violation depends on the actual implementation of UtAssertEx/UtAssert_True.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void ProbeLog(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2634.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (log)\n    {\n        va_list ap;\n        va_start(ap, fmt);\n        vfprintf(log, fmt, ap);\n        va_end(ap);\n        fprintf(log, \"\\n\");\n        fclose(log);\n    }\n}\n\nbool UtMem2BinFileCmp(const void *Memory, const char *Filename)\n{\n    FILE *       fp;\n    const uint8 *MemByte = Memory;\n    int          FileByte;\n    bool         Success;\n    uint32       i;\n\n    ProbeLog(\"ENTER: UtMem2BinFileCmp Filename=%s Memory=%p\", Filename, Memory);\n\n    Success = true;\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"r\")))\n    {\n        ProbeLog(\"fopen succeeded: %s, fp=%p\", Filename, (void *)fp);\n        for (i = 0; (FileByte = fgetc(fp)) != EOF; i++)\n        {\n            if (MemByte[i] != FileByte)\n            {\n                Success = false;\n                ProbeLog(\"Mismatch detected: file=%s, offset=%lu, expected=%u, found=%u\",\n                         Filename, (unsigned long)i, (unsigned int)MemByte[i], (unsigned int)FileByte);\n\n                /* preserve original diagnostic output */\n                printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Miscompare in file: %s, byte offset: %lu, expected: %u, found: %u\\n\",\n                       Filename, (unsigned long)i, (unsigned int)MemByte[i], (unsigned int)FileByte);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n        ProbeLog(\"fclose called for %s, returning Success=%d\", Filename, Success);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Log the fopen failure details and the assignment that follows */\n        ProbeLog(\"fopen FAILED: %s, errno=%d (%s)\", Filename, errno, strerror(errno));\n\n        Success = false;\n        ProbeLog(\"Assigned Success=false in else branch (before calling UtAssert_True)\");\n\n        /* preserve original diagnostic output and assertion call */\n        printf(\"UtMem2BinFileCmp: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n\n        /* Note: UtAssert_True may terminate execution (exit/abort/longjmp).

  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s scenario is plausible but not definitive. MISRA C 2023 R2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. If, in this project, UtAssert_True(false, ...) is guaranteed never to return (e.g. it calls abort/exit/longjmp and is documented or implemented as non\u2011returning), then the assignment Success = false; in the else branch is executed but has no observable effect (the function never returns) and therefore is dead code \u2014 that would be a violation. Conversely, if UtAssert_True may return (as its prototype/implementation in the project allows), then the assignment does affect observable behaviour because the function can continue and return Success, so there is no dead code and no R2.2 violation. Because the claim depends on the actual, project\u2011specific behaviour of UtAssert_True, the report as an absolute statement that the code violates R2.2 is not correct. Recommendation: make the intent explicit \u2014 either remove the redundant assignment, ensure the assertion call is documented/annotated as noreturn (so analyses can treat following code appropriately), or preserve the assignment but avoid relying on a non\u2011returning assertion to determine observable behaviour."
