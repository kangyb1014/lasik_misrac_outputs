Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have listed the code fragments above that merit investigation for possible dead operations under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Other parts of the function (declarations of local variables, the fopen() call and its null-check, the use of fgetc() to read bytes and the FileByte variable to detect EOF, the return of Success, and the use of format casts in the printf calls) are active, have observable effects on program behaviour, and are used in control flow or I/O. Therefore those other fragments are not considered dead and do not need to be investigated for Rule 2.2."
