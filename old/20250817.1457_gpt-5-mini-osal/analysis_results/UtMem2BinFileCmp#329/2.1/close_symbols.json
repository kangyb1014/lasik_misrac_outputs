  "explanation": "- UtAssert_True: Determine whether this routine is a terminating/noreturn assertion (e.g. calls exit/longjmp). If it never returns then any code after its call (notably the final return) can be statically unreachable.\\n- UtAssert_GetContext: The static call graph shows this is a callee related to the UtAssert family; its behaviour (side effects, longjmp/termination) may be relevant to whether UtAssert_True returns.\\n- fopen: Controls the if/else branch. If fopen is implemented/stubbed as always returning NULL or always non-NULL in the build, one of the branches could be statically unreachable.\\n- fgetc: Drives the for-loop termination condition (comparison with EOF). If fgetc is implemented to always return EOF or never return EOF, loop body or post-loop code may be unreachable.\\n- fclose: Included to review any annotations (e.g. non-return) or macros that could affect reachability; also to confirm callers in the success path.\\n- EOF: The loop termination constant; if EOF is redefined in the build to a value that affects the fgetc comparison in a constant way, reachability of loop body/exit can change.\\n- printf: Included to ensure printf is not a macro/annotation that changes control flow (e.g. replaced with an assertion that aborts), which would affect reachability of subsequent statements.\\n- strerror / errno: Used in the error branch printf; if strerror or errno are implemented as macros or functions with non\u2011returning behaviour in this build, they could make following code unreachable.\\n\nThese symbols are the external functions/macros whose implementations or annotations (in the current build/configuration) can make one or more parts of UtMem2BinFileCmp statically unreachable. Reviewing their definitions/attributes is necessary to determine compliance with the MISRA rule against unreachable code."
