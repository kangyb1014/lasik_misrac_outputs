  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains no compile-time constant conditions, unconditional jumps or code following an unconditional non-returning statement (other than the potential non-returning assertion shown above) that would make those fragments definitely unreachable. The fopen/fgetc loop and its break path are reachable depending on runtime file contents and fopen success; fclose(fp) follows the loop and is reachable after the loop completes or after break; the mismatch branch inside the loop is reachable when bytes differ. Therefore only the assertion-related lines and the final return (together with the UtAssert_True macro definition) need investigation to determine whether the assertion/UtAssertEx implementation is non-returning (which could make subsequent code paths unreachable). No other code fragments in the provided function show signs of being unconditionally unreachable."
