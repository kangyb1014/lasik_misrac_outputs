  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Neither function parameter is modified: \n- The pointer parameters are declared const (const void *Memory, const char *Filename) and are only read. There are no assignments to Memory or Filename, nor any pointer arithmetic applied to them. \n- A local pointer (const uint8 *MemByte = Memory) is created; this does not modify the parameter itself. Only read accesses (MemByte[i]) are performed, not writes to the pointed objects. \n- Filename is only passed to fopen/printf/strerror (read-only uses). \n- The loop assigns to local variables (FileByte, i, Success) but not to any function parameter. \nTherefore, with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified), there are no code fragments that require further investigation."
