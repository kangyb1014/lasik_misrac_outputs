  "explanation": "fopen \u2014 need the prototype (intended: FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode)) to verify that Filename is passed by value as a const char * (not as a pointer-to-pointer) and therefore the callee cannot change the value of the Filename parameter in the caller. This helps show fopen cannot cause a violation of the rule.\nfgetc \u2014 need the prototype (intended: int fgetc(FILE *stream)) to confirm it takes a FILE * and returns an int; it is used only to read bytes and cannot modify the pointer parameters Memory or Filename. Also needed to reason about EOF comparison.\nfclose \u2014 need the prototype (int fclose(FILE *stream)) to confirm it only takes a FILE * and cannot change Memory or Filename.\nprintf \u2014 need the prototype (int printf(const char *format, ...)) to confirm that format/arguments are passed by value and printf cannot modify the function parameters (only reads Filename when printing).\nstrerror \u2014 need the prototype (char *strerror(int errnum)) to confirm its usage strerror(errno) returns a pointer to a message and does not modify the caller\u2019s Filename or Memory parameters. Also to check whether it accepts any pointer-to-pointer forms (it does not).\nerrno \u2014 include the errno identifier (macro/global) to understand strerror(errno) usage; ensure no address of Filename or Memory is taken to pass to errno-related APIs.\nUtAssert_True \u2014 include this project-specific assertion function (its prototype) to verify whether it could be called in a way that modifies caller parameters (e.g., if it took pointer-to-pointer arguments). In this code it is called with a boolean and a string literal; verifying its signature shows it does not receive &Filename or &Memory and therefore cannot modify the parameter variables.\nUtAssert_GetContext \u2014 present in the static call graph as a callee of UtAssert-related functions; include it to check transitive effects (ensure none of these assert helpers are called with addresses of Memory or Filename that could mutate the parameter variables).\nFILE \u2014 include the FILE type definition to reason about how FILE * is used with fgetc/fopen/fclose and to ensure no implicit passing of addresses of the function parameters occurs.\nEOF \u2014 include the EOF macro/constant to interpret the fgetc loop termination and confirm no side effects that would modify parameters.\nuint8, uint32 \u2014 include the type aliases/typedefs used in the function to ensure that indexing MemByte[i] is a read of the object pointed to (and that Memory was declared const void * so the pointer variable is not modified). These types confirm that the function operates on the pointed-to object and that Memory is not reassigned.\n\nRationale summary: to decide MISRA Rule \u201ca function parameter shall not be modified\u201d we must confirm (1) the target function does not reassign its parameter variables and (2) no callee it invokes receives the address of those parameters (so they could change the parameter variables). The listed symbols are all external functions/types used in the body or reachable via asserts; inspecting their prototypes ensures none accept pointer-to-pointer parameters or are called with &Memory or &Filename, and therefore the target function does not modify its parameter variables."
