First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I inspected the target function OS_SocketListen_Impl and all provided related definitions. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the structure of for statements. No for statements appear in the target function, the called macros, or the inline function shown: - OS_SocketListen_Impl contains no loop constructs (for, while, do). - The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array indexing expression; it does not introduce a for loop. - OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is a simple accessor returning token->obj_idx and contains no loops. - The other provided declarations (table, typedefs, and the empty OS_DEBUG macro) contain no for loops. Therefore there are no code fragments relevant to Rule 14.2 to investigate in the supplied code. If there are additional, non-provided files or macro expansions (the ellipses) that contain for statements, please provide those so they can be reviewed for compliance with Rule 14.2."
