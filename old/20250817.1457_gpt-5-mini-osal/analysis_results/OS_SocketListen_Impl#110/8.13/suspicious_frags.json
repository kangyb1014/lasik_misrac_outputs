  "explanation": "The function parameter token is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *token), so it does not need investigation. The listen call uses an int file descriptor (no pointer types involved). The local scalar os_result and the return statements do not involve pointers. The only pointer-related constructs in this snippet are the local pointer variable and its initialization via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, and the use of strerror() which returns a char *; these three fragments are reported for investigation. No other fragments in the provided code contain pointer declarations or uses that could relate to Rule 8.13."
