  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function appears to modify the function parameter (the pointer token) or the pointer value itself. Details:\n- The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, and there is no assignment to token, no increment/decrement, and no other operation that would change the pointer value.\n- The only use of token is as *token in the macro invocation: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token). This yields an lvalue referring to the object pointed to; the macro takes the address (&(tok)) and passes that address to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, which accepts a const OS_object_token_t * and only reads token->obj_idx. No modification occurs.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET produces an address into the table and returns a pointer to OS_impl_file_internal_record_t; that pointer is stored in impl and used to call listen(impl->fd, 10). Neither token nor *token is modified.\n- The code does not modify the object referred to by token either (only reads obj_idx), and modifying the pointed-to object would be allowed by Rule 17.8 in general; here it does not happen.\nTherefore there are no fragments that require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
