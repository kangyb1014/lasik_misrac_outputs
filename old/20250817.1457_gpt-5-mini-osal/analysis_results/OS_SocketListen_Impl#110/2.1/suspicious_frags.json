  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for unreachable-code issues because:\n- The local declarations (int os_result; OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;) are not code paths and thus not subject to reachability.\n- The call to listen(impl->fd, 10); is an ordinary function call that will be executed at runtime (no compile-time constant condition prevents its execution).\n- The if (os_result < 0) { ... return OS_ERROR; } and final return OS_SUCCESS; are conditional and reachable depending on listen() result; there is no unconditional jump or return before them that would render them unreachable.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro usage is flagged above because its definition takes the address of the macro parameter (&(tok)) while the call passes *token; this could hide misuse or create unintended behavior in other contexts (hence included for inspection).\n- The OS_DEBUG macro is defined empty in the provided definitions; therefore the debug call and its argument (including strerror(errno)) may be removed by preprocessing, which effectively makes that code non-executable in this build. That is why the OS_DEBUG line and strerror(errno) are reported for investigation.\nNo other lines in the function present obvious unreachable-code concerns (no code appears after an unconditional return, no always-false compile-time conditionals, and no labelled but never-reached blocks)."
