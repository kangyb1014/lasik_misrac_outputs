  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C syntax and identifiers: function definition, ordinary integer return type alias (int32, which appears to be a project typedef rather than a compiler keyword), pointer operations (*, ->), standard library/POSIX calls (listen, strerror) and the errno macro. There are no compiler-specific constructs such as __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, __builtin_* intrinsics, nonstandard integer types provided by the compiler, or other documented compiler extensions.\n\nNote: Project macros referenced here (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_filehandle_table, OS_DEBUG, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS) are not shown; their expansions could potentially use compiler extensions. However, since their definitions are not in the provided code, they cannot be flagged from this fragment alone. If those macro definitions are available, they should be reviewed separately for any compiler-specific language extensions."
