  "explanation": "I inspected the provided OS_SocketListen_Impl function and the related symbol definitions. The MISRA C Rule 21.14 concerns use of the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The code shown calls listen(), strerror(), and accesses errno and file descriptor fields; there is no use of memcmp (directly or indirectly in the shown fragments) nor any code that compares null-terminated strings using memcmp. The struct definitions, token helpers, and macro return values are unrelated to string comparison. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
