  "explanation": "No calls to the string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in the function. The code does not call memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, or strspn (or any other buffer-writing string functions that take pointer parameters). The only string-related call is strerror(errno) inside OS_DEBUG; strerror does not take a pointer parameter (it takes an int and returns a pointer to an internal/static string) and is not among the listed functions subject to this specific rule. Also, OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro in the provided additional code, so no formatted-output function (e.g. printf) is actually invoked here. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.17 in the provided code."
