  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. In particular:\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- pthread_* calls (pthread_cond_wait, pthread_cond_timedwait, pthread_mutex_timedlock, pthread_cleanup_push/pop, pthread_mutex_unlock) are POSIX API calls/macros (library usage), not compiler language extensions as required by Rule 1.2 in this task; their use does not by itself indicate a compiler language extension documented as such.\n- The pthread_cleanup_push/pthread_cleanup_pop are POSIX macros that must be paired in the same lexical scope; they are not compiler language extensions in the sense required by this rule.\n- The conversion of void* (OS_Posix_BinSemReleaseMutex parameter) to pthread_mutex_t* when calling pthread_mutex_unlock is permitted in C (void* -> object pointer conversions are allowed), so this is not a compiler extension.\n- Use of sig_atomic_t, volatile, typedefs, macros, and other standard C constructs is standard C and not an extension.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that require investigation for compiler language extensions per MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as scoped in your instruction."
