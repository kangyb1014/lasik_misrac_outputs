  "explanation": "I inspected the function parameters token (const OS_object_token_t *) and timeout (const struct timespec *). No code in this function assigns to token or timeout (no occurrences of token = ..., timeout = ..., or taking &token to pass to functions that might modify the pointer variable). The uses are reads only: *token is dereferenced to obtain an object value for table lookup (sem = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token)) \u2014 this reads the pointed-to object but does not modify the pointer parameter itself. timeout is only compared against NULL and passed to pthread_cond_timedwait() which takes a const struct timespec * (it does not modify the caller\u2019s pointer variable). All assignments in the function modify local variables or members of the semaphore record (e.g., sem->current_value, sem->flush_request) \u2014 these modify the object referenced by sem, not any function parameter. The additional provided function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken also takes a const pointer and only reads token->obj_idx. Therefore there are no fragments that modify function parameters and no code that needs further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
