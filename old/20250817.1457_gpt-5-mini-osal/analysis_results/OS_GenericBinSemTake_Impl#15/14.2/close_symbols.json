Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required for MISRA C for-loop compliance analysis:\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET: This macro is used to obtain the 'sem' pointer; macros can expand into for statements or other control constructs. Need its definition to ensure it does not introduce a for-loop or violate the for-loop well-formedness rule.\n- OS_impl_bin_sem_table: The table object used by OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET may influence how the macro expands (e.g., via iteration). Inspecting it ensures no hidden for-loops are pulled into this function.\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Often used by OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET; it is in the static call graph and is a function that could itself contain for-loops. Must inspect its implementation for any for-statements that would count toward the rule (functions called within the function body are part of a for-loop's behaviour).\n- OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t: The definition of this struct is required to see the types of members (flush_request, current_value, cv, id). If any of those members are function-like macros or have side-effecting accessors, they could conceal for-loops or side-effects relevant to the rule.\n- OS_object_token_t: The token type is dereferenced in OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET; its definition is needed to fully understand the macro/function expansion and ensure no implicit loops or side effects are introduced.\n- OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex: A direct callee. Its implementation must be checked for any for-loops (and whether those loops modify objects that would conflict with a for-loop counter if a for existed here) or for any side-effects relevant to MISRA's loop restrictions.\n- OS_Posix_BinSemReleaseMutex: Passed as cleanup handler via pthread_cleanup_push; its definition is required to ensure it contains no problematic for-loops or side-effects that would affect loop-counter rules if executed from within a for-loop context.\n- pthread_cleanup_push: Typically a macro; its expansion could introduce control-flow constructs. Need the exact macro expansion to ensure it doesn't introduce for-loops or violate loop rules.\n- pthread_cleanup_pop: Same as pthread_cleanup_push \u2014 check expansion for any control constructs (including for) or interactions with loop counters.\n- pthread_cond_wait: A POSIX function called inside the loop-like wait construct. Although in-library, its source/implementation (or documentation of its behaviour) should be checked insofar as MISRA requires considering called functions as part of for-loop behaviour. Confirm it does not rely on or create for-loops that affect program-level loop-counter rules.\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: Same reasoning as pthread_cond_wait \u2014 its implementation or documented behaviour should be reviewed for internal for-loops or side-effects relevant to loop analysis.\n- ETIMEDOUT: The macro/constant used to compare pthread_cond_timedwait return value. Include to ensure correct control-flow reasoning; not a for-loop itself but needed to reason about the control paths.\n- OS_SUCCESS: Returned/checked in this function; include to understand control-flow and whether any macros expand into loops.\n- OS_SEM_FAILURE: As above \u2014 used in early return, include to fully analyze control-flow and macros that may hide loops.\n- OS_SEM_TIMEOUT: Returned on timeout; include to fully reason about control-flow paths that could interact with any for-loop constructs.\n- pthread_mutex_t: The type of sem->id; include to ensure accessors or wrappers around the mutex are not macros that introduce for-loops.\n- pthread_cond_t: The type of sem->cv; include for same reason as pthread_mutex_t.\n\nIn summary: include the definitions/implementations of all macros, structs and called functions used directly or indirectly by this function (particularly OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, the POSIX cleanup/cond/mutex macros/functions, and the sem internal record) so that any hidden or nested for-statements introduced by expansions or by called functions can be located and checked against the MISRA for-loop well-formedness requirements."
