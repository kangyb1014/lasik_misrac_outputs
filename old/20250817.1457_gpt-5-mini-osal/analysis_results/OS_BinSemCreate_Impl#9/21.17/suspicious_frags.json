  "explanation": "Only the calls that use the <string.h> functions (or that provide the pointers passed to them) need investigation for Rule 21.17. The memset call is a direct use of a string.h function that writes to the object pointed to by sem; the sem assignment is included because it produces the pointer passed to memset and there is no null/validity check before the memset. Other fragments do not call functions from <string.h> that take pointer parameters (pthread_* calls, OS_DEBUG calls, condition/mutex handling, and assignment to sem->current_value), so they are not relevant to Rule 21.17. Note: strerror(ret) is invoked only as an argument to OS_DEBUG; strerror takes an int and returns a pointer to an internal message string (it does not take a caller-provided pointer to write into), so it does not fall under this rule's pointer-parameter bounds concern and thus is not flagged."
