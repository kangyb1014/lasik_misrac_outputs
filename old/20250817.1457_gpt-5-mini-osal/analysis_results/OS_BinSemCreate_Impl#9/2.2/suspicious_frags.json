  "explanation": "I only flagged fragments that are executed in this function and look potentially redundant (i.e. their removal might not change program behaviour) and therefore should be investigated for possible dead code per MISRA C Rule 2.2. I did NOT flag the OS_DEBUG(...) invocations because the provided definition (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)) expands to nothing, so those debug calls are not executed and thus not within the Rule 2.2 dead-code category (they are effectively compiled out). I did not flag the resource-tracking variables (attr_created, mutex_created, cond_created) or their assignments because they are used in the cleanup logic and thus affect behavior on failure paths. I did not flag the initialization and create calls for the mutex and condition variable (pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutex_init, pthread_cond_init) nor the error-path assignments to return_code because those are operational code that affect program behavior. I also did not flag the initial_value > 1 check because it alters observable behaviour. The three listed fragments should be reviewed to determine if they are truly needed in this codebase (for example memset may be redundant if all fields are initialized later; pthread_cond_signal immediately after init is often a no-op; pthread_mutexattr_destroy may be a no-op on some platforms), and to ensure no executed but unnecessary operations remain."
