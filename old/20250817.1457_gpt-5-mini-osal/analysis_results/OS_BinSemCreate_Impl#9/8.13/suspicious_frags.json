  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found w.r.t. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in the provided function. Rationale for not flagging any pointer uses:\n\n- The function parameter token is already declared as const OS_object_token_t *token, satisfying the rule for that input pointer.\n- The local pointer sem (OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem) is used to modify the semaphore record (memset, initializing members, assigning current_value). Because the object is intentionally modified, sem cannot be const-qualified.\n- mutex_attr (pthread_mutexattr_t) is initialized and modified (pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol). It therefore must be a non-const object and cannot be declared as pointing to const.\n- The addresses of sem->id and sem->cv are passed to pthread_mutex_init / pthread_cond_init and are intended to be modified by those calls; these cannot be const-qualified pointers.\n- Passing &mutex_attr to pthread_mutex_init is acceptable: the POSIX prototype takes a const pthread_mutexattr_t * for the attribute parameter, so passing the address of a non-const object to a const parameter is valid and does not violate the rule. The object itself cannot be const because it was modified earlier.\n- The call to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET uses *token (token is const), and the resulting pointer refers to the global table element that the implementation must modify; therefore a non-const pointer is appropriate.\n- Calls to library functions that return char * (e.g., strerror) are uses of returned pointers rather than pointer declarations in this code; there are no pointer variable declarations here that could be made const.\n\nGiven that every pointer in this function either is already const where appropriate or must be non-const because the pointed-to object is intentionally mutated (or because the POSIX API requires modification), there are no candidates that should be changed to point to a const-qualified type. Thus no fragments need investigation for Rule 8.13."
