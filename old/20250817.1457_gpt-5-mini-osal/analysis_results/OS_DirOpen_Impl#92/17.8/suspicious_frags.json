  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because there are no other operations in the provided code that assign to or otherwise change the pointer parameters (token or local_path). In particular: (1) There is no assignment to the parameter variables token or local_path anywhere in the function body. (2) Dereferencing token (via *token in the macro invocation and via OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) only reads the referred object; the inline function takes a const pointer and only accesses token->obj_idx. (3) The macro takes the address of its argument expression (&(tok)) and uses it for index lookup; this does not modify the original pointer parameter. (4) The assignment impl->dp = dp writes into the implementation table record, not into any of the function parameters. Therefore no other lines in the shown code appear to modify the function parameters and do not need further investigation for Rule 17.8."
