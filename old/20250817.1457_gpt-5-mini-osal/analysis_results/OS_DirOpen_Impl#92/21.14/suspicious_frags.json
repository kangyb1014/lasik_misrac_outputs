  "explanation": "I inspected the target function OS_DirOpen_Impl and the related definitions provided. There are no calls to memcmp anywhere in the target function or the supplied supporting code (the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, the table declaration, and the struct/type definitions). The code only calls opendir(local_path) and performs pointer/table indexing and assignments \u2014 none of which use memcmp or perform string comparisons via memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If there are other files or code not shown here, those would need to be checked for memcmp usage, but based on the provided snippets nothing is suspicious."
