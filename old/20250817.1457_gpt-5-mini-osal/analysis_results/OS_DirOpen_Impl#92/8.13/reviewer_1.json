  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_DirOpen_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 8.13.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_DirOpen_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_DirOpen_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path)\n{\n    DIR *                          dp = opendir(local_path);\n    OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    if (dp == NULL)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    impl     = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token);\n    impl->dp = dp;\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The macro takes the address of its tok parameter (&(tok)). In the call OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token) the actual tok is *token where token is declared const OS_object_token_t *. That makes &(tok) a const OS_object_token_t *. If OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (and thus the macro) expects a pointer to non-const OS_object_token_t, the const qualifier is discarded when passing &(tok) \u2014 i.e. a pointer to a non-const type is used where a pointer to a const-qualified object is available. This violates the intent of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. To fix, make OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accept a pointer-to-const (const OS_object_token_t *) or avoid taking the address of a const-qualified lvalue here.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log_bytes(FILE *f, const void *ptr, size_t n)\n{\n    const unsigned char *b = (const unsigned char *)ptr;\n    size_t i;\n    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n    {\n        /* limit output so logs are readable */\n        if (i && (i % 16) == 0)\n        {\n            fputc('\\n', f);\n        }\n        fprintf(f, \"%02X \", (unsigned) b[i]);\n    }\n    fputc('\\n', f);\n}\nstatic void probe_log_before(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/739.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"[OS_DirOpen_Impl] Enter\\n\");\n    fprintf(f, \"  local_path: %s\\n\", (local_path != NULL) ? local_path : \"(null)\");\n    fprintf(f, \"  token pointer: %p\\n\", (const void *)token);\n\n    /* If the token type is available, dump a limited prefix of its bytes for diagnosis. */\n    if (token != NULL)\n    {\n        size_t tsize = sizeof(*token);\n        fprintf(f, \"  token sizeof: %zu bytes (showing up to 64 bytes)\\n\", tsize);\n        probe_log_bytes(f, token, (tsize > 64u) ? 64u : tsize);\n    }\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\nstatic void probe_log_after_open(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path, DIR *dp)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/739.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"[OS_DirOpen_Impl] After opendir\\n\");\n    fprintf(f, \"  local_path: %s\\n\", (local_path != NULL) ? local_path : \"(null)\");\n    fprintf(f, \"  dp pointer: %p\\n\", (void *)dp);\n    fprintf(f, \"  token pointer: %p\\n\", (const void *)token);\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\nstatic void probe_log_after_table_get(const OS_object_token_t *token, DIR *dp, OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/739.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"[OS_DirOpen_Impl] After OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and assignment\\n\");\n    fprintf(f, \"  token pointer: %p\\n\", (const void *)token);\n    fprintf(f, \"  impl pointer: %p\\n\", (void *)impl);\n    fprintf(f, \"  impl->dp (before/after assign expected to be same as dp): %p\\n\", (void *)(impl ? impl->dp : NULL));\n    fprintf(f, \"  assigned dp pointer: %p\\n\", (void *)dp);\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_DirOpen_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path)\n{\n    DIR *                          dp;\n    OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    /* Log entry state */\n    probe_log_before(token, local_path);\n\n    dp = opendir(local_path);\n\n    /* Log result of opendir */\n    probe_log_after_open(token, local_path, dp);\n\n    if (dp == NULL)\n    {\n        /* Document error path */\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/739.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"[OS_DirOpen_Impl] opendir returned NULL -> returning OS_ERROR\\n\");\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * The call below is the original code that was reported to trigger the\n     * const-qualification scenario: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET takes the address of\n     * its tok parameter (&(tok)).

  "explanation": "The claim is not proven by the provided evidence. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 advocates using pointers to const where possible. In the posted code the parameter is already declared const OS_object_token_t *token and the call uses *token (a const lvalue). Whether a const qualifier is discarded depends entirely on the definition of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (and any function it calls, e.g. OS_ObjectIndexFromToken): if that macro/function expects a pointer-to-non-const and the implementation casts away const, then that would be a genuine violation and should be fixed. However, you did not provide the macro or function definitions. Two facts argue against the reported violation as-is: (1) implicit conversion from const T * to T * is not allowed in standard C \u2014 so if the macro actually passed a const OS_object_token_t * to a parameter declared as OS_object_token_t * the compiler would produce a type-mismatch warning or the macro would have to contain an explicit cast (which would be visible in the macro definition). (2) your test code compiled successfully, which makes it unlikely that a plain incompatible pointer conversion exists in that expansion. Conclusion: the report is speculative and not proven correct with the given artifacts. To decide definitively, inspect the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (and the called functions) to see whether they accept const-qualified pointers or whether they explicitly cast away const; if they cast away const, that is a MISRA 8.13 issue and should be fixed (make the parameter const or avoid the cast)."
