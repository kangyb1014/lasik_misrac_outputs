  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either already use const qualification where appropriate (e.g. the function parameter for the path is declared const char *), or they involve pointer targets that are intrinsically mutable/opaque (the DIR object returned by opendir is a mutable/opaque type and typically requires non-const access), or they are unrelated macros/constants (return codes, array size constants, etc.). The selected fragments cover places where pointer const-qualification could be lost or where non-const pointers are stored/retrieved from shared data structures or via macros \u2014 these should be inspected further to determine whether const qualifiers could or should be added without breaking intended mutability."
