  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function body uses standard C constructs: a pointer declaration, a call to opendir (a POSIX API, which is a library/system API and not a compiler language extension), null check, assignment to a table entry via a macro, and return of integer macros. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and its use with *token rely on standard address-of and dereference semantics and do not use any compiler-specific extensions. The typedefs (int32 from int32_t, struct types) and macros (OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS) are standard C usage. There are no occurrences of documented compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, anonymous structs/unions with nonstandard behavior, designated initializers with compiler-specific forms, VLAs as an extension, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
