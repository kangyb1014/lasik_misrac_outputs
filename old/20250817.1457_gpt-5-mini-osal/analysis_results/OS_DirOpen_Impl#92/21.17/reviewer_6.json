  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_DirOpen_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_DirOpen_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_DirOpen_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path)\n{\n    DIR *                          dp = opendir(local_path);\n    OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    if (dp == NULL)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    impl     = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token);\n    impl->dp = dp;\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:Calling OS_strnlen(VirtualPath, OS_MAX_PATH_LEN) can read up to OS_MAX_PATH_LEN bytes from VirtualPath even if the actual object it points into is smaller or lacks a '\\0' within that range. OS_CHECK_POINTER only ensures VirtualPath is non-NULL, not that the object has at least OS_MAX_PATH_LEN bytes or contains a NUL before that limit. For example, if OS_MAX_PATH_LEN == 64 and VirtualPath points into a buffer of size 10 with no terminating NUL, OS_strnlen may access bytes beyond the buffer bounds, violating Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_DirOpen_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path)\n{\n    /* Probe logging: append control-flow and state info to a log file for reproduction\n     * This logging intentionally avoids reading the contents of local_path to prevent\n     * introducing additional out-of-bounds reads. It records the pointer values and\n     * outcomes (success/failure) around the opendir call so other agents can reproduce\n     * and analyze the reported violation scenario. */\n    FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/743.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"OS_DirOpen_Impl ENTRY: token=%p, token_deref=%p, local_path=%p\\n\",\n                (const void *)token,\n                (const void *)(token ?

  "explanation": "The reported violation is not correct for the shown OS_DirOpen_Impl. Rule 21.17 concerns uses of the string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strlen, strnlen/strcpy/etc.) that may access beyond the bounds of the objects passed to them. The provided OS_DirOpen_Impl does not call any of the <string.h> functions \u2014 it only calls opendir(local_path). The agent's scenario describes a potential out-of-bounds read by OS_strnlen(VirtualPath, OS_MAX_PATH_LEN), but that function call does not appear anywhere in the OS_DirOpen_Impl code given. If opendir (part of the C library) internally uses string.h functions and that implementation reads beyond the buffer, that would be a library implementation defect, not a direct MISRA 21.17 violation of this function's source. To be a valid 21.17 violation in this module there must be a direct call to a <string.h> routine whose parameters could cause an out-of-bounds access; that is not present here. Therefore the agent A report (as applied to this code) is incorrect."
