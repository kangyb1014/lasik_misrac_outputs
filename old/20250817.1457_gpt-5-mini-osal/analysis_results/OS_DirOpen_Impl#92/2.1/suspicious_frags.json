  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Rationale:\n\n- All statements in the function are reachable depending on run-time conditions: if opendir(local_path) returns NULL the function takes the conditional branch and returns OS_ERROR; otherwise execution continues to obtain the table entry and assign impl->dp before returning OS_SUCCESS. Both return statements are reachable along different control-flow paths.\n- There is no code following a return that would be statically unreachable.\n- The macro invocation impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token) expands to an expression that is evaluated at run time and its result is used; it does not introduce unreachable code. The macro uses &(tok) where tok is *token in this call; &(*token) is token and is a valid pointer expression, so no unreachable code is produced by the macro expansion in this usage.\n- The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is used inside the macro and its body (return token->obj_idx;) is reachable when the macro is evaluated.\n\nGiven these points, there are no code fragments in the supplied code that appear to be statically unreachable and thus needing further investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1."
