  "explanation": "I reviewed all pointer usages in the supplied code. The only pointer parameters are: (1) const char *task_name / const char *name \u2014 these are already const-qualified and therefore comply with Rule 8.13; (2) osal_id_t *task_id and osal_id_t *object_id \u2014 these are used as output parameters (the code assigns to *task_id / *object_id), so they must be non-const and are therefore appropriate as written; (3) the local token is passed by address to functions that obtain/release it and is modified, so a non-const pointer is required. The OS_CHECK_POINTER macro is only performing a NULL check and does not imply a missing const qualification. Given these usages, there are no pointer declarations in the provided fragments that could be safely changed to point to const-qualified types, so no suspicious fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
