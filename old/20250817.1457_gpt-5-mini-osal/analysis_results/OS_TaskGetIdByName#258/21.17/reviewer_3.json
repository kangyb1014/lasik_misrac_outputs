  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_TaskGetIdByName code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_TaskGetIdByName.\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskGetIdByName(osal_id_t *task_id, const char *task_name)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(task_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(task_name);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindByName(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, task_name, task_id);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, ...) macro likely computes the string length (e.g. via strlen) to compare against OS_MAX_API_NAME. ARGCHECK only verifies name != NULL but does not guarantee a terminating NUL within the object bounds. If LENGTHCHECK uses an unbounded strlen (or other <string.h> functions that scan until NUL), and the supplied 'name' buffer is not NUL-terminated within its allocated bounds, the call can read past the end of the object. This would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void os_probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2071.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (fp == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If the log cannot be opened, do nothing to avoid affecting\n         * normal program behavior. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(fp, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fputc('\\n', fp);\n    fclose(fp);\n}\nstatic void os_probe_task_name(const char *name)\n{\n    os_probe_log(\"[probe] OS_TaskGetIdByName: task_name pointer=%p\", (const void *)name);\n\n    if (name == NULL)\n    {\n        os_probe_log(\"[probe] task_name is NULL\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* If the build defines OS_MAX_API_NAME we can perform a bounded\n     * search for the terminating NUL using that bound.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The presented OS_TaskGetIdByName implementation contains only pointer checks and a call to OS_ObjectIdFindByName; it does not itself call any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The agent's scenario correctly identifies a plausible risk: if a LENGTHCHECK/OS_ObjectIdFindByName implementation uses an unbounded string-scan (e.g. strlen) on a buffer that is not NUL-terminated within its allocated bounds, that callee would violate Rule 21.17 by accessing beyond the object. However, that potential violation would be in the code that performs the string operation (LENGTHCHECK or OS_ObjectIdFindByName), not in OS_TaskGetIdByName as shown. The probe output demonstrates a case where the supplied name lacks a NUL within OS_MAX_API_NAME (so an unbounded scan could over-read), but it does not prove that OS_TaskGetIdByName itself uses any <string.h> function or performed an out-of-bounds access. Therefore the claim that OS_TaskGetIdByName violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is incorrect; any violation would have to be attributed to the routine that actually invokes the standard string functions."
