  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions targeted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in the function. The code does not call memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn or any other string-copy/compare functions that accept user-supplied pointer/length parameters that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses. The only string-related function visible is strerror(status) in the debug messages; strerror takes an int and returns a pointer to an internal/static error string (it does not write into or read from caller-supplied buffers) so it does not fall under the rule\u2019s concern about accesses beyond the bounds of objects referenced by pointer parameters. The OS_DEBUG macro is empty in the provided definitions, so it does not introduce any string handling here. All other operations are pthread calls and table/index macros that do not perform string handling. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied function that need investigation for Rule 21.17."
