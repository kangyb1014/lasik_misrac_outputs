  "explanation": "No pointer declarations in this function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer variables/uses are:\n\n- The function parameter: const OS_object_token_t *token \u2014 already const\u2011qualified, satisfying the rule.\n- The local pointer: OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl \u2014 this must be a pointer to a mutable object because the code calls pthread_mutex_init(&impl->mut, ...) and pthread_cond_init(&impl->cv, ...), which modify the pointed\u2011to structure members. Therefore impl should not be const\u2011qualified.\n- Address\u2011of usages: &impl->mut and &impl->cv are addresses of members passed to pthread init functions; those API calls modify the mutex/condvar objects so const would be inappropriate.\n- strerror(status) returns a char * from the C library; it is used only for read\u2011only reporting. The pointer is not declared here and the code does not retain or modify the returned buffer; its use does not indicate a local pointer that should be const\u2011qualified.\n\nBecause each pointer usage either is already const where appropriate or must remain non\u2011const due to subsequent modification, there are no code fragments in this function that require further investigation for Rule 8.13."
