  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the supplied code fragment. The function uses standard C constructs only: a typedef'd integer type (int32 from int32_t), a typedef'd parameter type (UT_EntryKey_t), the standard C ellipsis (...) for variable arguments, and the standard <stdarg.h> macros/types (va_list, va_start, va_end). There are no occurrences of compiler-extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, asm, __builtin_*, typeof, inline-assembly, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, or other vendor-specific keywords. The usage of va_list being forwarded to another function is a standard pattern (assuming the callee expects a va_list) and not a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
