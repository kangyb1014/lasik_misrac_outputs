  "explanation": "No pointer-to-non-const occurrences are present in the provided code fragment. The only pointer-like parameter is 'const char *FunctionName', which is already const-qualified and therefore conforms to Rule 8.13. The local 'va_list va' is not a pointer to an object that could/should be const-qualified within this function (it represents variadic argument state and is correctly used with va_start/va_end). There are no other pointer declarations, pointer returns, or pointer-to-non-const parameters in this snippet that would warrant investigation for missing const qualification. (Any potential mismatch where this function passes 'FunctionName' to another function that expects a non-const char* cannot be assessed from this fragment alone and would need the callee's signature.)"
