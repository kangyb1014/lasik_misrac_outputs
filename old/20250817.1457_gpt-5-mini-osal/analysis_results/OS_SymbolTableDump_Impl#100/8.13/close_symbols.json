  "explanation": "int32 (typedef) - confirm this is an integer type (not a pointer or typedef to a pointer). If int32 were an alias for a pointer type the MISRA pointer/const analysis would change. size_t (typedef / <stddef.h>) - ensure SizeLimit is not a pointer type (and to confirm normal usage); if size_t were redefined unexpectedly it could affect pointer-related rules. OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED (macro or enum) - verify the return expression/type does not involve pointers hidden behind macros/enum values (ensures the function does not actually return or handle pointer types). OS_SymbolTableDump (caller) \u2014 source or prototype - inspect how filename is produced and passed (is it a string literal, a const char *, or a mutable buffer?) and whether the caller or other code expects the callee to modify the pointed-to data; this determines whether the const qualification on the parameter is appropriate. OS_TranslatePath \u2014 source or prototype (used by caller) - the caller uses this to prepare filename in many implementations; examine whether it returns/produces a mutable buffer that might be modified by the callee or whether it yields a const string. This helps determine whether marking the parameter as pointing-to-const is semantically safe."
