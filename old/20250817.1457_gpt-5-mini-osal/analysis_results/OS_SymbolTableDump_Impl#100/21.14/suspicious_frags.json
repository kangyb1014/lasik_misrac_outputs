  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code fragments (OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl, OS_SymbolTableDump, the OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED define, and the shown calls/macros). There are no calls to memcmp, nor any occurrences of comparing null-terminated strings using memcmp in the supplied code. OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is a stub that immediately returns OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED and contains no string operations. The other identifiers that could perform string work (OS_TranslatePath, OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, etc.) have no implementations shown here, so they cannot be flagged from the provided snippets. If those external functions or macros are of concern, their implementations must be supplied for review; based solely on the given code, there are no fragments that violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.14."
