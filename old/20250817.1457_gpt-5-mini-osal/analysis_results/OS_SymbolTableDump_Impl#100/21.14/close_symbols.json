  "explanation": "1) OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: The target function's body returns this symbol. It must be inspected to ensure it is a simple constant/enum and not a macro or expression that expands to code (or calls) that could use memcmp. 2) memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. Include the memcmp symbol so the analyzer can quickly detect any direct or indirect use (including via macro/inline wrappers) inside the target function or any symbols it expands to. 3) OS_SymbolTableDump: This is the caller listed in the static call graph. While the target function has no callees, the caller should be checked to confirm there is no inlining/macro trickery or alternate build variants that replace the Impl body with code that uses memcmp. Inspecting the caller helps rule out cross-function/code\u2011generation cases where memcmp could be introduced into the effective implementation."
