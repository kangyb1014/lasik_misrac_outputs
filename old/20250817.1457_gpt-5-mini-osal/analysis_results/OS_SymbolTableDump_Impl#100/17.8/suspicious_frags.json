  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameters are: (const char *filename, size_t SizeLimit). The filename parameter is const-qualified, so neither the pointer itself nor the pointed-to object is modified in the body. The function body contains only a comment and a single return of the constant OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED (defined as (-28)); there are no assignments, increments, reassignments, pointer arithmetic, or calls that could modify either parameter. Therefore there are no occurrences in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
