  "explanation": "The compile error was caused by a local typedef and a static const named OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED that collided with a macro of the same name from the project's headers. I removed the redundant typedef and the conflicting static const definition so the code uses the existing OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED macro defined in the included headers. No other logic was changed; the function still logs the same information and returns OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED as before."
