  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to decide if OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is dead code:\n\n- OS_SymbolTableDump: This is the direct caller of the Impl function. You must inspect its implementation to see whether and under what conditions it invokes OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl (unconditional, conditional, via function-pointer indirection, etc.). Removal of the Impl only affects behavior if this caller can reach it.\n\n- OS_printf, OS_TranslatePath, OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel, UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These are the callees used by OS_SymbolTableDump (per the static call graph). Analyzing OS_SymbolTableDump's control flow, side effects, and conditional paths requires their definitions/signatures to determine whether OS_SymbolTableDump will ever call the Impl in normal or test builds (for example, stubs/hooks may override behavior). Also unit-test stub machinery can affect whether the Impl is executed only under test builds.\n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: The exact value/semantics of this macro/constant are needed to determine whether returning it produces any observable behavior that would change if the Impl were removed (e.g., if callers examine this specific code and behave differently). If it is an alias for another value or has side effects (unlikely but must be checked), that could affect the dead-code decision.\n\n- OS implementation/registration tables (e.g. OS_impl_module_table, OS_api_function_table): Implementation functions are often referenced indirectly via registration tables or function-pointer dispatch tables. The Impl may be reachable via such tables even if direct callers are limited. You must check these tables to see if OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is referenced/installed at runtime.\n\n- All external callers of OS_SymbolTableDump (application-level call sites): To conclude the Impl is dead, you must ensure no application code (or other translation units) ever invokes OS_SymbolTableDump (the wrapper). Even if the static graph shows no callers today, link-time references, dynamic dispatch, or external applications could call the wrapper; those call sites must be enumerated.\n\nIn short: to determine whether OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl is dead code you need the caller (OS_SymbolTableDump) and everything that affects whether that caller will invoke the Impl (the callees used by the caller, unit-test/stub hooks, the error-code macro, any registration/dispatch tables that could reference the Impl, and any external callers of the wrapper)."
