  "explanation": "1) OS_SymbolTableDump: This is the direct caller shown in the static call graph. To decide if OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl itself is unreachable (dead code) you must inspect the caller(s) and their reachability from program entry points. Analyze OS_SymbolTableDump to see whether the call-site can be executed (conditional flow, compile-time guards, or removed by preprocessing), which determines if the implementation is unreachable.\n\n2) OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: The implementation simply returns this symbol. You must know whether this is a plain compile-time constant (macro/enum) or something more complex (macro that expands to expressions or function-like construct) to ensure the return statement is valid and does not create unreachable code patterns inside the function. Confirming its definition rules out hidden side-effects or conditional expansion that could change control flow.\n\n3) Build-time configuration macros that control inclusion of symbol-table functionality: Many OSAL implementations conditionally compile feature implementations. You must check any relevant compile-time flags (feature macros) that enable/disable the symbol-table API or swap in alternate implementations. Those macros determine whether this function is compiled/linked at all and whether its body or the caller is excluded, which affects whether the code is unreachable in the final build."
