  "explanation": "1) OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED \u2014 The function simply returns this symbol. To determine whether the target function uses any <string.h> routines (directly or indirectly via macro expansion) you must inspect the definition of OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED to confirm it is a plain integer/enum constant and not a macro or expression that expands into code that calls string handling functions or performs pointer/length operations that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n2) size_t \u2014 Present as the type of the SizeLimit parameter. While the target function body does not use SizeLimit, checking the typedef/definition of size_t (from the translation unit's includes) ensures there are no unexpected macro redefinitions or unusual typedefs that could affect interpretation of pointer/length arithmetic or promote hidden uses of string routines in macros or inline wrappers in this compilation unit."
