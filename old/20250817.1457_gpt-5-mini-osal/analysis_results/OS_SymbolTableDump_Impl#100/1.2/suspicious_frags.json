  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses standard C constructs: a typedef'd int32 (backed by standard int32_t), size_t, const char*, C-style comments, and a simple #define for a negative constant. There are no occurrences of commonly recognized compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_... identifiers, typeof, statement-expressions (GCC ({ ... })), inline assembly, #pragma with nonstandard directives, extended integer types, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
