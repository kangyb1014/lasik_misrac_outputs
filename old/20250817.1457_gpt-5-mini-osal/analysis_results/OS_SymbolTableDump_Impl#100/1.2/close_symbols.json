  "explanation": "To determine whether this function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual declarations/definitions behind the names and types used in the function signature and return expression: \n\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: This is the literal returned by the function. It may be a macro, enum, or expression that could conceal compiler-specific constructs or extensions (e.g. use of __attribute__, statement-expression macros, or compiler builtins). Inspecting its definition is required to ensure no language extensions are used.\n\n- int32: The function return type is a typedef; the typedef may be implemented with compiler-specific types or extensions (for example __int32, compiler-specific alignment or attributes). Confirming its definition ensures the type itself is not a language extension.\n\n- size_t: The parameter uses size_t; while normally standard, the actual typedef in the translation unit or included headers should be checked in case it was redefined using nonstandard/compiler-specific means.\n\n- OS_SymbolTableDump_Impl (declaration/prototype): The prototype or header-level declaration of the function may include macros or attributes (visibility attributes, calling-convention macros, __attribute__((...)), linkage macros, etc.) that are language/compiler extensions. Inspecting the declaration/header shows whether the function is annotated with any extensions even if the implementation body does not show them.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their header/definition locations) lets the next analyzer verify the code does not depend on compiler-specific extensions hidden behind macros, typedefs, or attributes."
