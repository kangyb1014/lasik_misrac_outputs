  "explanation": "- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: need the struct/type definition to see whether its members are const-qualified (or could be) and to determine the types of impl->cond and impl->mutex. If the struct or its members were const-qualified the pointer use in this function might be illegal or require casts.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: need the declaration/type of this table to know whether it holds pointers to const or non-const OS_impl_objtype_lock_t objects (i.e. OS_impl_objtype_lock_t * vs const OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *). That affects whether the local 'impl' could/should be a pointer-to-const.\n- pthread_cond_broadcast: need the function prototype (parameter type) to know whether it accepts a const or non-const pthread_cond_t *; if it requires a non-const pointer, that prevents making impl (or the cond member) const in this context.\n- pthread_mutex_unlock: same reason as above \u2014 need the prototype to confirm whether it requires a non-const pthread_mutex_t *.\n- pthread_cond_t and pthread_mutex_t: the typedef/type definitions clarify whether these types are modifiable objects or have any const in their declarations; they are the types of the members whose addresses are taken and passed to the pthread APIs.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether the pointer 'impl' (or the members it points to) could/should be declared with const qualification without causing type mismatches when calling pthread_cond_broadcast and pthread_mutex_unlock, which is the core of the MISRA rule check here."
