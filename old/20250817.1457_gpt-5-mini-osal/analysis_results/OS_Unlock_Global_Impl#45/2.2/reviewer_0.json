  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_Unlock_Global_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_Unlock_Global_Impl.\n```c\nvoid OS_Unlock_Global_Impl(osal_objtype_t idtype)\n{\n    OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *impl;\n    int                     ret;\n\n    impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype];\n\n    if (impl != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Notify any waiting threads that the state _may_ have changed */\n        ret = pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cond);\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cond): %s\", strerror(ret));\n            /* unexpected but keep going (not critical) */\n        }\n\n        ret = pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mutex);\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock(&impl->mutex): %s\", strerror(ret));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The conditional handling of pthread_cond_broadcast errors is dead. The code tests 'if (ret != 0)' and its body only calls OS_DEBUG(\"...\", strerror(ret)); but OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro, so the if-body generates no code (strerror is not evaluated). The conditional and its body therefore have no observable effect and could be removed without changing program behaviour, which constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nvoid OS_Unlock_Global_Impl(osal_objtype_t idtype)\n{\n    OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *impl;\n    int                     ret;\n\n    /* Probe: open log file to record control flow and state for this call.\n       Using append mode so repeated calls accumulate evidence. */\n    FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/362.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"OS_Unlock_Global_Impl called with idtype=%d\\n\", (int)idtype);\n    }\n\n    impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype];\n\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"impl pointer = %p\\n\", (void *)impl);\n    }\n\n    if (impl != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Notify any waiting threads that the state _may_ have changed */\n        if (log != NULL) fprintf(log, \"About to call pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cond)\\n\");\n        ret = pthread_cond_broadcast(&impl->cond);\n        if (log != NULL) fprintf(log, \"pthread_cond_broadcast returned %d\\n\", ret);\n\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            /* The original code called OS_DEBUG(\"...\", strerror(ret));\n               In some builds OS_DEBUG is an empty macro so the strerror() call\n               is not evaluated and no code is generated. To avoid changing\n               original runtime behaviour we do NOT call strerror() here.\n               Instead we log that the branch was taken and record the raw\n               error code so observers can reproduce that the conditional\n               was reachable but produced no observable effect in builds\n               where OS_DEBUG is empty. */\n            if (log != NULL)\n            {\n                fprintf(log, \"Branch taken: (ret != 0). error code = %d. strerror() not invoked to preserve original behaviour.\\n\", ret);\n            }\n            /* unexpected but keep

(log != NULL) fprintf(log, \"pthread_mutex_unlock returned %d\\n\", ret);\n\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            if (log != NULL) fprintf(log, \"pthread_mutex_unlock error code = %d\\n\", ret);\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        if (log != NULL) fprintf(log, \"impl is NULL: no cond/mutex operations performed\\n\");\n    }\n\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fflush(log);\n        fclose(log);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nAfter executing all tests, we received the following output from the test code.\nFor this task, assume the following:\n- The test suite is exhaustive and has covered all edge cases.\n- There are no missing scenarios.\n- You must not include any caveats or question the test results.\n\nBased on this, analyze the output and validate the scenario

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. In the project configuration described, OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro so the error-handling statement inside if (ret != 0) produces no code (strerror() is not evaluated). The conditional test and its (now-empty) body therefore execute but have no observable effect; removing that test and body would not change the program behaviour in this build. Given the provided exhaustive test evidence and the stated configuration, that code constitutes dead code and thus violates Rule 2.2."
