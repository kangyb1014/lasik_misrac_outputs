  "explanation": "To determine if OS_Unlock_Global_Impl modifies its parameter (osal_objtype_t idtype) we need the following symbols:\n\n- osal_objtype_t: Confirm whether idtype is an integer/enum (passed by value) or a pointer type. If it is a pointer type the rule permits modifying the object pointed to but forbids changing the pointer itself. Knowing the typedef is essential.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: Inspect its declaration/definition (array, macro, or function-like macro) to ensure indexing with idtype does not cause side effects that would modify idtype (for example a macro that evaluates or assigns to its argument). If this is a macro, its expansion must be examined for side effects.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The struct/type of the table elements (to confirm impl->cond and impl->mutex are fields and that operations performed on them do not involve idtype). This helps verify that only the objects retrieved from the global table are acted on, not the parameter itself.\n\n- pthread_cond_broadcast and pthread_mutex_unlock: Their prototypes/semantics confirm they take pointers to synchronization objects and do not (cannot) modify the local parameter variable idtype. Including them confirms no indirect modification of the parameter via those calls.\n\n- OS_DEBUG (macro/definition): The logging macro could be a complex macro that evaluates its arguments multiple times or has side effects. Verify its definition to ensure it does not reference or modify idtype.\n\nThese symbols collectively let the analyst determine whether idtype itself is ever assigned to or otherwise modified (directly or via macro side-effects) within OS_Unlock_Global_Impl."
