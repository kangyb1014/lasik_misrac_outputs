  "explanation": "To determine whether any statements in OS_Unlock_Global_Impl are provably unreachable you must know how the impl pointer (and therefore the if (impl != NULL) branch) behaves for all possible inputs and program states. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: the global array accessed by OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]. You need its declaration, size, and current contents/initial values to know whether entries can be NULL or non-NULL for any index.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: the type of the table entries. Knowing this confirms that impl is a pointer type and shows the fields used (cond, mutex) but primarily documents the intended semantics of table entries.\n\n- osal_objtype_t: the type/definition (likely an enum) of idtype. You need its valid value range to know what indexes into OS_impl_objtype_lock_table are possible/defined and whether indexing could be out of range or limited to a subset of table entries.\n\n- OS_Unlock_Global: the direct caller of OS_Unlock_Global_Impl. Its implementation shows how idtype is constructed/passed to the Impl routine and whether it ever passes values that make impl non-NULL or always NULL.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry: higher-level callers of OS_Unlock_Global (per the static call graph). Their code is needed to see real-world call sites and idtype values used at runtime; if all call sites pass idtype values that map to NULL entries, the if-block would be unreachable.\n\n- (initializer/population code for OS_impl_objtype_lock_table): any code that initializes or populates OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (static initializers, init functions, registration code). This determines whether table entries are ever set to non-NULL during program execution; without it you cannot decide if the if-block can ever be entered.\n\nNote: library functions used inside the if-block (pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_mutex_unlock), OS_DEBUG, and strerror are not required to decide reachability of the if-block itself; they only affect behavior inside an already-reachable branch."
