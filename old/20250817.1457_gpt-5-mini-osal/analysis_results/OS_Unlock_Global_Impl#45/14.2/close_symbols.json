Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required (concise):\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  Needed to know what impl can point to (object layout, lifetime, aliasing) and whether indexing by idtype can access/modify objects used as loop counters or loop-control flags.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t (struct)\n  The target dereferences impl->cond and impl->mutex; the struct definition (and semantics of its members) is required to determine what objects are being modified/passed to called functions and whether those objects could alias loop counters or be modified in ways that violate the for-loop clauses.\n\n- pthread_cond_t\n  Type of impl->cond; required to understand what pthread_cond_broadcast operates on and whether that operation can have persistent side effects on program objects relevant to for-loop well-formedness.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t\n  Type of impl->mutex; required to understand what pthread_mutex_unlock operates on and whether unlocking can affect variables that a for-loop second/third clause depends on.\n\n- pthread_cond_broadcast\n  The function is called from the target; its semantics and possible side effects (including whether it alters global state or objects that a caller's for-loop clause might use) must be known because the behaviour of functions called from a for-loop body counts toward the for-loop's behaviour.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock\n  Same reasons as pthread_cond_broadcast: need its semantics and side effects to judge whether calling it from a for-loop body would violate the rule (e.g., by modifying objects other than the loop counter).\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  May be a macro or function that performs I/O or calls other functions; its side effects must be known (it is invoked on error paths) to determine if it modifies objects that would invalidate the \u2018\u2018no persistent side effects\u2019\u2019 requirement for the second clause or the \u2018\u2018only modify loop counter in third clause\u2019\u2019 rule when the function is called from a for-loop body.\n\n- strerror\n  Used to format error messages; implementation may use static buffers or global state. Its reentrancy/side-effects are relevant when the target is invoked from a for-loop body.\n\n- osal_objtype_t\n  Type of idtype used to index the table; need its definition/range to reason about indexing, possible out-of-bounds, and aliasing implications relative to loop counters or loop-control flags.\n\n- OS_Unlock_Global\n  The direct caller of OS_Unlock_Global_Impl. To determine if the target function can cause a for-loop violation we must inspect call sites: if the caller contains a for-loop that calls the target inside its body, the behaviour of the target (and functions it calls) contributes to the loop body behaviour.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry\n  These are callers of OS_Unlock_Global (per the static call graph). They should be inspected because they (or OS_Unlock_Global) may contain for-loops that call OS_Unlock_Global_Impl. If so, the side effects of OS_Unlock_Global_Impl (and functions it calls) must be considered when deciding whether the for-loops are well-formed under the MISRA rule.\n\nIn short: include all symbols that define the objects accessed (table and struct/members), the functions called (and their side-effects), the index/type used, and the callers where this function might be invoked from inside a for loop. This is the minimal set required to reason whether any for-loop that includes a call to this function could violate the MISRA \"for loop shall be well-formed\" constraints."
