  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule about string.h bounds (no out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses) the following additional symbols are needed and why:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  - The function reads impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]; we must know the definition/type and layout of this table to confirm when impl can be NULL and that impl->cond / impl->mutex point at valid objects. This is needed to ensure no hidden string operations or copies target invalid memory.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n  - The struct/type provides the fields impl->cond and impl->mutex (and any other members). Knowing the types and any associated semantics helps determine the validity of operations that produce the error codes later passed to strerror/OS_DEBUG and to ensure there are no embedded string buffers involved that could be overflowed.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - OS_DEBUG is used with a \"%s\" format and the result of strerror. Its implementation (macro or function) is essential: if OS_DEBUG formats into a fixed-size internal buffer (e.g., via snprintf into a bounded array) it could create a destination buffer overflow when substituting the %s content. To check MISRA string-bounds concerns you must inspect OS_DEBUG\u2019s formatting behavior and any destination buffer sizes.\n\n- pthread_cond_broadcast\n  - The return value from pthread_cond_broadcast is captured in ret and passed to strerror when nonzero. You need the declaration/semantics (range and meaning of returned error codes) to verify that passing that int into strerror is valid and will not cause strerror to read/write out of bounds. Also to confirm that the returned errno values are appropriate inputs for strerror on the target platform.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock\n  - Same reasoning as pthread_cond_broadcast: the error code returned by pthread_mutex_unlock is passed to strerror; its valid range/semantics must be known to confirm appropriate use with strerror and to rule out any abnormal error codes that could provoke undefined behavior in strerror.\n\n- strerror\n  - This is the string.h function actually used. To assess MISRA string-bounds concerns you must know its contract on the platform: that it returns a pointer to a null\u2011terminated char buffer, the buffer lifetime, whether it may return a pointer into a static buffer (and its maximum length), and whether reading that string via %s or copying it could access beyond bounds. If the platform provides alternative implementations (strerror_r, thread\u2011safe variants) those differences must be considered.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the call sequence (obtaining error codes from pthread functions, passing them to strerror, and formatting them via OS_DEBUG) can lead to any out\u2011of\u2011bounds reads or writes related to string handling."
