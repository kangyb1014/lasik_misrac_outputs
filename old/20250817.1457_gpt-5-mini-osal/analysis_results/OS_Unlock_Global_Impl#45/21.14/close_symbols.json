  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any symbols that the target function references (or that those references might expand into) because the rule is about uses of memcmp anywhere in project code reachable/visible from this function: \n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: global variable referenced by index; its definition/initialization could contain project code that uses memcmp on strings. \n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: the type definition for impl; its declaration may contain macros, inline helpers, or methods that call memcmp (or macro expansions). Also needed to confirm member types. \n- OS_DEBUG: usually a macro or wrapper for logging \u2014 it may expand to project code that performs string comparisons (possibly via memcmp) or call other project functions, so its definition must be examined. \n- strerror: called here to format messages; if the project provides a wrapper or replacement for strerror, that implementation must be checked for memcmp usage. (If it is the standard library implementation, it is not part of project source but should be noted.) \n- pthread_cond_broadcast / pthread_mutex_unlock: these are library functions; include them to be explicit. If the project provides platform wrappers or reimplementations, those must be inspected for memcmp usage. \n- osal_objtype_t: the enumerated/type used to index the table; its definition may be colocated with other code that uses memcmp or related helpers. \n- pthread_cond_t / pthread_mutex_t: member types of impl; include to locate the full definition of OS_impl_objtype_lock_t and any associated macros/helpers that could hide memcmp usage.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/implementations of every symbol the function references (and macros that expand therefrom) to ensure none of them (directly or via wrappers/macros) use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
