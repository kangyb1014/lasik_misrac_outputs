  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule about language extensions we must inspect any declarations/macros referenced by the function to see if they use compiler extensions (attributes, asm, typeof, statement-expressions, __extension__, non-standard keywords, etc.):\n\n- osal_objtype_t: The parameter type could be a typedef or enum declared with compiler-specific extensions; need its definition to verify it uses only standard C.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The struct/typedef for this type may contain non-standard members, attributes, or compiler-specific annotations on the type or its fields; inspect its definition.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The global/object definition or initializer could use GCC/clang extensions (designated initializers are C99 but other initializers or attributes on the object could be extensions); check its declaration/definition.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: This macro expands at the call sites; macros can hide extension usage (statement-expressions, typeof, asm, attributes, variadic GCC-specific forms). Inspect the macro definition/expansion to ensure it uses only standard preprocessor features.\n\n- pthread_cond_broadcast: Although POSIX, implementations may provide macros or annotated declarations using compiler-specific attributes; check its declaration/definition to ensure no extension usage is relied upon here.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock: Same rationale as pthread_cond_broadcast \u2014 verify the declaration/definition does not use language extensions that affect the call site.\n\n- strerror: The C library declaration or any wrapper macro could use extensions; include its prototype/definition to be sure no extension is present.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their declarations/definitions) lets the next analyst determine whether any language/compiler-specific extensions are being used in or exposed through the target function."
