  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in this function do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: \n- The impl pointer (OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t *impl and its assignment via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) is assigned to and impl->id is modified, so it must remain a pointer to a non-const type. \n- queueAttr is written (memset and assignments) before being passed to mq_open, so it cannot be const. \n- name is written via snprintf and therefore cannot be const. \n- Passing addresses (e.g. &queueAttr or name) to POSIX functions is constrained by those APIs; changing local variable types to const would be incorrect where the variable is modified or the API requires a non-const object. \n- Calls like strerror(errno) or mq_unlink(name) are uses of library functions and do not introduce pointer declarations in this function that could be const-qualified here. \nGiven the above, the only local pointer in this function that is only read (not written) and therefore should be investigated for possible const qualification is the queue pointer and its assignment from the object table."
