  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. With OS_DEBUG defined empty (e.g. #define OS_DEBUG(...)), each call OS_DEBUG(\"...\"); in the function is reduced by the preprocessor to a null statement (a lone semicolon). Those null statements are executed as no-ops and their removal would not change program behaviour in that build configuration, which matches the rule's definition of dead code. The test-probe not producing logs does not refute this: it only shows the function wasn't exercised in the test or the probe wasn't reached. Note: if OS_DEBUG is defined to something that has observable side-effects (e.g. a logging function), then the calls would not be dead; the violation only applies for builds where the macro expands to nothing (or to a no-effect expression)."
