  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not call the <string.h> functions that operate on caller-supplied pointer buffers (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). Specifically:\n- The only buffer write from external input is via fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fp), which passes the correct size (sizeof(buffer)) and checks the return value; fgets guarantees null-termination when it returns non-NULL, so this use does not produce out-of-bounds writes.\n- The subsequent call to strtoul(buffer, NULL, 10) is in stdlib.h and reads the nul-terminated buffer produced by fgets; it does not write through any caller-supplied pointer and therefore is not a <string.h> bounds-writing risk.\n- File operations (fopen/fclose) and pthread calls (pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init) do not invoke <string.h> buffer-manipulating functions on caller-provided buffers and thus are not relevant to Rule 21.17.\n- There are no occurrences of memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn or similar direct string-manipulating calls in the remainder of the function that would raise Rule 21.17 concerns."
