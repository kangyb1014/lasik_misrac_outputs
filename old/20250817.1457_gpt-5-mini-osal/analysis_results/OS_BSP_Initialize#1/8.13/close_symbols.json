  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA guideline about const-qualified pointer types you must examine the declarations/signatures and relevant definitions of all external symbols that involve pointer parameters or pointer-return values used by OS_BSP_Initialize:\n\n- fopen: its prototype shows whether the pathname parameter is const-qualified (expected: const char *pathname). This determines if passing a string literal is consistent with const usage.\n- fgets: its prototype (char *fgets(char *s, int, FILE *)) shows that the buffer argument is non-const because fgets writes into it. This justifies buffer being non-const and is necessary to determine if a const qualification would be possible.\n- fclose: prototype (int fclose(FILE *)) documents constness of FILE* parameter (non-const) \u2014 relevant for pointer-parameter constness analysis of stdio functions in this function.\n- strtoul: its prototype (unsigned long strtoul(const char *, char **, int)) shows the input string parameter is const-qualified. This matters because buffer is passed to strtoul; the call is allowed to accept const input, so buffer does not need to be const for that call.\n- strerror: prototype (char *strerror(int)) returns a non-const char *. MISRA may flag APIs that return non-const pointers to immutable data; knowing this is necessary to judge whether passing strerror() result violates the rule or whether the API itself is the reason.\n- FILE: the FILE type definition (opaque stdio type) is needed to see pointer constness in all stdio function prototypes used.\n- BSP_DEBUG: definition/prototype (macro or function) is required to check the parameter types (e.g., format string const char *) and whether passing strerror(status) or string literals matches constqualification expectations.\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: macro/inline definition is required to see whether it takes pointers or yields types that affect pointer constness (in case it hides casts or pointer conversions relevant to the rule).\n- OS_BSP_Global: the definition of this global (structure) and the type of MaxQueueDepth is required to ensure assignments do not involve pointer-to-non-const to const conversions or vice versa.\n- pthread_mutexattr_t: type definition is needed to see whether pthread_mutexattr_* APIs require non-const pointers (they modify the attr), which justifies non-const usage.\n- pthread_mutexattr_init: prototype shows it takes pthread_mutexattr_t * (non-const) \u2014 needed to justify non-const pointer use.\n- pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol: prototype shows it takes pthread_mutexattr_t * (non-const) \u2014 relevant for constness analysis of the attr parameter.\n- pthread_mutex_init: prototype (int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *, const pthread_mutexattr_t *)) or implementation-dependent signature is necessary to check constness of the attr argument and the mutex pointer; some platforms take a const attr pointer \u2014 this affects whether the code's usage respects const qualification.\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal: the definition (structure) and the type of AccessMutex (pthread_mutex_t) are needed to confirm the pointer types passed to pthread_mutex_init and whether they should be const.\n- PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT: macro value is not a pointer but including it helps verify the pthread API usage and signature compatibility.\n\nCollecting the exact prototypes/definitions above (from the platform headers and project headers/macros) allows a precise determination whether any pointers passed or received in OS_BSP_Initialize could/should be const-qualified under MISRA rules, or whether the external API signatures themselves prevent adding const."
