  "explanation": "For assessing whether OS_BSP_Initialize (or anything it calls) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any called functions/macros that handle or compare C strings. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- BSP_DEBUG: Logging macro/function used in this routine. Its implementation may perform string formatting, comparison, or routing to other logging wrappers; inspect it to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: Macro or inline helper used to convert the numeric value returned by strtoul. Macros/inlines can contain string operations or comparisons; inspect its definition to ensure no memcmp-on-strings occurs.\n\n- fopen: Standard library function called with a pathname string. While the library implementation normally will not use memcmp for comparing user-level null-terminated strings, a project may wrap or replace fopen; verify the actual implementation used in the build to ensure it does not call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- fgets: Reads a C string into buffer. If any wrapper or replacement of fgets is present in the project, it might perform comparisons; inspect the implementation used in the build to ensure no memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- fclose: Closing the FILE; included to allow inspection of any wrapped FILE handling routines in the project that might perform string comparisons internally.\n\n- strtoul: Converts the read string to an unsigned long. Verify the implementation or any wrapper to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings (standard implementations do not, but project-provided variants should be checked).\n\n- strerror: Produces a C string error message. Inspect its implementation or wrapper, since it returns/handles C strings and could (in project-specific code) perform string comparisons using memcmp.\n\nOnly symbols that manipulate or propagate C strings are listed because the MISRA rule specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings; other symbols in the function that do not touch strings (e.g., pthread mutex calls or the OS_BSP_Global numeric field) are not required for this specific check unless they map to project code that manipulates strings."
