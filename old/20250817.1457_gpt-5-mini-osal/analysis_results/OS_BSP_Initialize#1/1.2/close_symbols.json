  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule forbidding compiler language extensions you must inspect any macros, global objects, and external APIs used by OS_BSP_Initialize to ensure they do not rely on compiler-specific extensions (e.g. statement-expressions, typeof, __attribute__, nested functions, inline assembly, nonstandard storage-class keywords, etc.). The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: This is a macro used to compute MaxQueueDepth. Macros are common places to hide compiler extensions (statement expressions, typeof, __extension__, GCC builtins). Need its definition to ensure it is standard-conforming.\n- BSP_DEBUG: A logging macro that may use variadic/inline constructs or compiler-specific attributes; must inspect its definition for extensions.\n- OS_BSP_Global and OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth: The global object and the type of MaxQueueDepth must be known to confirm no nonstandard type qualifiers or compiler-specific extensions are used in the assignment/cast.\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal and OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex: Need definition/type of AccessMutex (expected pthread_mutex_t) to ensure it does not use compiler-specific types/attributes.\n- pthread_mutexattr_t, pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init, PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT: pthread APIs and constants come from system headers and could be implemented with attributes or nonstandard macros; inspect their declarations/definitions to ensure they are standard POSIX usage and do not employ compiler extensions.\n- FILE, fopen, fgets, fclose: stdio types/functions \u2014 check their declarations (macros/wrappers) in the platform headers to rule out embedded extensions.\n- geteuid: POSIX function \u2014 check its prototype/definition for any platform-specific extension usage.\n- strtoul: Standard library function \u2014 check prototype/implementation wrappers for extensions.\n- strerror: Standard function \u2014 inspect definition/wrapper for extensions.\n- NULL: Macro definition can vary; ensure it is the standard null pointer constant and not an implementation extension.\n\nCollecting these definitions (from the OSAL headers that define OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C/BSP_DEBUG and the OS_BSP global objects, and from the system headers <pthread.h>, <stdio.h>, <unistd.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h> or where these symbols are declared) is necessary to determine whether the target function or any referenced macro/type uses compiler-specific language extensions in violation of the MISRA rule."
