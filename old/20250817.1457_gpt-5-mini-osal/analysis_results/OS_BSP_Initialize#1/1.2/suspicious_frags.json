  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the presented code. The items in the function are standard C (C99/C11) language constructs or POSIX API usage, which are not compiler language extensions per se: - fopen, fgets, fclose, strtoul, FILE, buffer arrays and casts are standard C library and language features. - The OSAL macro OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C is a plain C cast macro. - BSP_DEBUG is a variadic macro (#define BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)), which is standard since C99 (not a compiler extension). - pthread types and functions (pthread_mutexattr_t, pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init) and PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT are POSIX APIs, not compiler language extensions. - geteuid() and access to /proc are OS/POSIX-specific, not language extensions. - There are no uses of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions ({ ... }), inline assembler, or other compiler-specific tokens. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
