  "explanation": "The remaining code in OS_BSP_Initialize performs observable actions or potential side effects and therefore is not a likely candidate for dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: - The geteuid()/fopen()/fgets()/fclose()/strtoul() sequence performs file I/O and modifies OS_BSP_Global.MaxQueueDepth (a global) \u2014 removing these calls would change program behaviour. - The calls to pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol and pthread_mutex_init invoke POSIX API functions that affect mutex state and scheduling behaviour; these calls have side effects and timing impacts and so are not removable without changing behaviour. - Local variables (fp, buffer, mutex_attr, status) are used in ways that affect control flow or API calls; their presence is purposeful. - There is no plainly unreachable code elsewhere in the function (no constant-false branches or dead assignments unrelated to side-effecting calls). Therefore only the empty debug macro and the if-blocks that contain it are flagged for investigation as potential dead/no-op code; other fragments should not be investigated for Rule 2.2 because their removal would alter behaviour or timing."
