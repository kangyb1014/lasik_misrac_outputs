  "scenario": "OS_SelectMultiple takes non-const pointers ReadSet and WriteSet and forwards them to OS_SelectMultiple_Impl. If the select implementation only inspects these fd sets (i.e. does not modify the objects pointed to), then the parameters should be declared as const OS_FdSet * in the API and in the implementation. By using non-const pointer types when const qualification is possible, the code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
