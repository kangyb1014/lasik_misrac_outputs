  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not involve pointer-to-object parameters or pointer usage that could be const-qualified: the local variable declaration (int32 return_code;), the return statement (return return_code;), comments, and braces contain no pointer types to consider. There are no other pointer parameters, pointer arithmetic, or pointer assignments in this function body that would fall under Rule 8.13, so they do not require further investigation here. The only places where pointer const-qualification could be applicable are the function parameters and the call that forwards them (both reported above)."
