  "scenario": "No violation: In the typical semantics of a select-like function, ReadSet and WriteSet are input/output parameters that the call modifies to report ready descriptors, so they must not be const. If, contrary to that typical use, the implementation only reads these sets and never modifies them, then omitting const would violate Rule 8.13."
