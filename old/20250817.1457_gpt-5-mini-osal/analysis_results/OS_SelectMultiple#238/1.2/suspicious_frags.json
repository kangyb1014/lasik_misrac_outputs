  "explanation": "I examined the provided code and related definitions for uses of compiler-specific language extensions (examples: __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, nested functions, statement-expressions, __declspec, pragma with compiler-specific tokens, inline assembler, or other documented compiler extensions). None are present: the code uses standard typedefs (int32 -> int32_t), standard C constructs (function definitions, pointers, returns), standard macros (FD_ZERO/FD_SET from system headers), and ordinary array declarations. There are no __-prefixed compiler keywords, no asm blocks, no GNU statement-expressions, no MSVC declspecs, and no compiler-specific pragmas. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions not used)."
