  "explanation": "No code fragment in OS_SocketBindAddress_Impl modifies a function parameter (neither the pointer variables token or Addr nor their values). Specific points: - impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token); only reads the object referred to by token via *token; it does not assign to token itself. Even if the macro indexes a table, that uses the value of *token and does not modify the parameter. - sa = (const struct sockaddr *)&Addr->AddrData; takes the address of a member of the object pointed to by Addr and stores it in a local pointer sa; this does not modify Addr. - The switch reads sa->sa_family and sets the local variable addrlen; no assignments to token or Addr occur. - bind(impl->fd, sa, addrlen) passes the local sa and does not modify the pointer parameters within this function. - Error handling and return statements do not modify parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
