  "explanation": "I found no uses of the <string.h> string-handling functions that take pointer parameters in the provided function. The only call that originates from <string.h> is strerror(errno), but strerror does not accept a pointer parameter that could lead to an out-of-bounds access under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so it is not relevant to this rule. Other calls and constructs (the bind(impl->fd, sa, addrlen) call and the cast of Addr->AddrData to struct sockaddr) do not involve functions from <string.h>; therefore they are not candidates for investigation under Rule 21.17. (Note: the bind usage could be examined under other MISRA rules or safety checks because addrlen is derived from sa_family rather than Addr->ActualLength, which can create a potential out-of-bounds read for bind, but that is outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
