  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function or related snippets. All operations in OS_SocketAddrSetPort_Impl are: computing sa_port with htons, casting Addr->AddrData to an accessor type, and assigning to sin_port or sin6_port fields. These are direct field accesses/assignments and not string/memory-handling library calls that could read/write via pointer parameters beyond object bounds. Therefore there are no fragments here that trigger Rule 21.17 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation under that rule. (Note: concerns about overall buffer sizing of AddrData or other code that fills AddrData could be relevant to other rules, but such string/memory operations are not present in the shown code and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
