  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function (variable declarations: in_port_t sa_port; OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor; and the case AF_INET assignment and its break when considered on their own) are direct, observable operations that affect program behaviour: the AF_INET case assigns the port into the address structure and therefore cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. The switch header and break statements are control-flow constructs required for correct semantics and are not candidates for dead-code removal. The #ifdef surrounding the IPv6 case means that the IPv6 code is only present when the build explicitly enables it; that conditional compilation is a build-time inclusion decision rather than runtime dead code. Declarations and initializations that are subsequently used are not dead code (initialization is explicitly excluded by the rule notes). Unselected fragments were therefore not flagged because they perform observable effects or are structural/compile-time constructs that cannot be classified as dead code without additional build-time or runtime context."
