  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The code uses standard C features and POSIX/socket types: function-local declarations, casts, unions, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef/#endif), and standard networking types/functions (in_port_t, htons, sockaddr family constants). There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, inline assembly, GNU statement labels, anonymous structures/unions beyond standard C union use, or other vendor-specific keywords. The conditional compilation symbol (OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6) is a standard preprocessor macro, not a language extension. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
