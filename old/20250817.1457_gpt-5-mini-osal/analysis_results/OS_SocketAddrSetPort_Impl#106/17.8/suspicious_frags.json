  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the pointer parameter Addr itself. The function only: (1) reads Addr to derive the address of its AddrData (&Addr->AddrData) and stores that address in a local pointer Accessor, (2) writes to members of the object pointed to by Addr (Accessor->sa_in.sin_port or Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_port), and (3) assigns PortNum to a local sa_port after conversion. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified but the pointer itself shall not be modified \u2014 this code does not assign to Addr (or otherwise modify the pointer parameter). The cast to OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t* and use of Accessor are local operations that do not alter the function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
