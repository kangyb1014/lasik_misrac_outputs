  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that could be const-qualified. The code contains only a few pointer occurrences: the function parameter Addr and the local pointer Accessor (and uses of Accessor). These are listed above for investigation to determine whether they could/should be const-qualified. Other fragments do not need investigation for 8.13: PortNum and sa_port are scalar (not pointers); the assignments to Accessor->sa_in.sin_port and Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_port are explicit writes to the address data (so the pointer must allow modification and thus cannot be const); the return statements and numeric macros are unrelated to pointer const qualification. No other pointer variables or pointer-typed expressions appear in the provided function, so no additional fragments are relevant to Rule 8.13."
