  "explanation": "- OS_SockAddr_t: Needed to see the declaration of Addr and its member AddrData (type and any const-qualification). To decide if the pointer parameter (OS_SockAddr_t *Addr) could be const, we must know whether AddrData is a mutable buffer/member or already const.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The function casts Addr->AddrData to this accessor type and writes through it. Its definition shows whether members are lvalue fields (writable) or pointers/references and whether any members are declared const, which directly affects whether the incoming pointer can be const-qualified.\n- struct sockaddr (sa_family): The switch uses Accessor->sa.sa_family. Knowing the exact type and location of sa_family confirms which union/variant is selected and whether accessing through the accessor can be const.\n- struct sockaddr_in (sin_port): The code assigns to sin_port. Its declaration (type and qualifiers) determines whether that write is a modification of the object the Addr pointer refers to, which prohibits making Addr const.\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (sin6_port): Same reason as sockaddr_in for the IPv6 branch.\n- in_port_t: To check type compatibility of sa_port and the sin_port/sin6_port fields (ensures assignment is modifying a non-const object of compatible type).\n- htons: Prototype/behavior confirms it returns a value (not a pointer) so the function is performing a write into Addr rather than aliasing through returned pointer.\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: Values used in the switch to determine control flow; needed to confirm which branches write into which members (and therefore whether any branch leaves Addr unmodified so a const pointer could be allowed in some paths).\n- uint16 and int32: Typedefs for parameter and return types to understand signedness/intent; not central but useful for correctness/context when assessing whether pointer should be const.\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS and OS_SUCCESS: Return-code macros/values to understand function behavior; while not directly affecting const qualification, they provide context for whether the function is intended to mutate Addr on success/failure.\n\nIn short: the key symbols are the OS_SockAddr_t and OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t/type definitions and the sockaddr_in/sockaddr_in6 fields (sin_port/sin6_port). These show whether the function writes through the Addr pointer (thus preventing it from being const) or could be refactored to take a const pointer."
