  "explanation": "The only use of string.h functions in the provided code is strncpy in OS_DirRead_Impl and the related manual termination of the destination buffer; these must be investigated to ensure the copy cannot access beyond the bounds of dirent->FileName. Also the de = readdir(impl->dp) / de->d_name source is included because the length of this source string (d_name) is not constrained here and is directly copied, so its relationship to the destination buffer size must be checked. Other fragments (OS_DirectoryRead parameter checks, OS_ObjectIdGetById, token handling, OS_ObjectIdRelease, and inline helper functions) do not invoke string.h functions and do not perform string copies, so they are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation for this specific rule."
