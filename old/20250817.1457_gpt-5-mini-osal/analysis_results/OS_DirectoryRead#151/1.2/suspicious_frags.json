  "explanation": "I examined the provided function for use of compiler-specific language extensions. The code contains only standard C constructs: a function definition, local variable declarations, pointer parameters, macro invocation (OS_CHECK_POINTER), function calls, comments, and return statements. There are no occurrences of common compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), or other vendor-specific keywords or token sequences. The typedef-like identifiers (int32, osal_id_t, os_dirent_t, OS_object_token_t) are ordinary type names and not language extensions by themselves. The macro OS_CHECK_POINTER is invoked but its expansion is not shown in this fragment; the invocation alone is not evidence of a compiler extension. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
