  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that are demonstrably unreachable from the supplied code. Reasons: \n- There are no conditionals with constant conditions (no if (0) / if (1) / #if 0 patterns) or unconditional jumps that make subsequent statements dead. All if/else branches depend on return values from other functions or on runtime results (e.g. pthread_cond_destroy), which are not compile-time constants and therefore may evaluate either way at runtime. \n- There is no code after an unconditional return (each return is the final statement of its function or within a conditional branch that can be taken). \n- Macros/constants shown (e.g. OS_SUCCESS == 0) are used in comparisons with runtime-returned values, so those comparisons are not statically constant. \n- Helper routines called (OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, pthread_cond_destroy, etc.) could return different values in different situations, so the related branches are potentially reachable.\n\nBased on the provided fragments, none of the code appears to be statically unreachable; therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 2.1. If there are other files or definitions (for example, if some of the helper functions are implemented as macros that always return a fixed value), re-supplying those could reveal unreachable code to inspect."
