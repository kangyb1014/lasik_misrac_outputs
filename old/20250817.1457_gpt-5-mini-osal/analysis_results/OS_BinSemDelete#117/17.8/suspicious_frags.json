  "explanation": "No function parameter of OS_BinSemDelete is modified in this code. The only parameter is sem_id and it is only passed by value to OS_ObjectIdGetById; there is no assignment to sem_id nor any operation that would alter it. The variable token is a local object whose address (&token) is passed to helper functions \u2014 modifying the object pointed-to via that pointer is permitted by Rule 17.8, and passing the address does not modify any function parameter of OS_BinSemDelete. return_code is also a local variable. There are no reassignments, pointer arithmetic, or casts involving the function parameter that would suggest a Rule 17.8 violation. Therefore no fragments require further investigation for this rule."
