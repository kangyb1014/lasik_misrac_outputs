  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Agent A's scenario describes a no-op \"default: break;\" in a switch in OS_CleanUpObject, but the supplied target code is OS_BinSemDelete which contains no such switch or an obviously dead operation. OS_BinSemDelete executes a sequence of calls conditioned on the result of OS_ObjectIdGetById; there is no code that is executed yet removable without changing program behaviour (no unreachable code, no executed no\u2011ops in this function). The added logging in the test code is extra instrumentation (and unrelated to the claimed switch/default issue) and does not demonstrate dead code in the original function. In short, the reported violation is misattributed and not supported for the shown OS_BinSemDelete code, so the report is incorrect."
