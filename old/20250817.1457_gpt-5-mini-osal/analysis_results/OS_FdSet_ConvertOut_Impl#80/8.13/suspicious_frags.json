  "explanation": "Only pointer occurrences in this function are the parameter OS_set and its use in FD_ISSET. OSAL_set must remain non-const because the function modifies OSAL_set->object_ids (e.g. objids = OSAL_set->object_ids[offset]; and OSAL_set->object_ids[offset] &= ~(1 << bit);), so it is not a candidate for const-qualification. Other identifiers (offset, bit, id, objids, osfd, OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd) are not pointer parameters that could be const-qualified here, or they are used for modification/assignment and thus are not applicable to Rule 8.13. Therefore only the OS_set parameter and its use should be investigated for possible const-qualification."
