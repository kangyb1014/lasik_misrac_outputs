  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameters in OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl should be const-qualified (per MISRA rule), the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_FdSet (type/struct definition): Shows the exact type of the second parameter and whether its members (object_ids) are modifiable. The function explicitly writes to OSAL_set->object_ids, so the struct definition confirms that the parameter cannot be made a pointer-to-const for that member.\n\n- OSAL_set->object_ids (member declaration / element type and size): Confirms the member's element type (e.g., uint8[]) and size so the modification OSAL_set->object_ids[offset] &= ~(...) is indeed a write. This directly determines that OSAL_set cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- fd_set (type/struct definition): The first parameter is fd_set *; the concrete type is needed to know whether reads via FD_ISSET are compatible with a const-qualified pointer and whether any direct operations here could modify the object.\n\n- FD_ISSET (macro / definition): FD_ISSET is used to read OS_set. Its definition (macro expansion) determines whether it requires a plain fd_set * (non-const) or whether passing a const fd_set * would be valid without qualifier-discarding issues. Some implementations define the macro to dereference the pointer for reading only (which would allow const), but the exact definition is required to be sure.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (declaration) and its element type (struct with member 'fd'): The function reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd. Knowing the element type confirms this is a read-only access and does not force const qualification on any pointer parameters; also shows whether that global is const-qualified itself (affecting how reads are treated).\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro or inline function): This macro/function computes the osal_index_t id from an integer. If this macro had side effects or required non-const inputs, it could affect const considerations; the analyzer must confirm it is a pure conversion.\n\n- osal_index_t (typedef): Needed to know the underlying integer type and whether any conversions could involve pointers or produce aliasing/side effects relevant to const correctness.\n\n- uint8 (typedef): Confirms the type of object_ids elements and that bitwise operations operate on integer types (no pointer aliasing issues).\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): Used in the comparison id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; knowing this symbol is not about const pointers but ensures the analyzer understands the control flow that guards the read of OS_impl_filehandle_table and thus whether any pointer could be modified.\n\nThese symbols collectively allow the next analyst to determine (1) which parameters are actually written to (so cannot be const), (2) whether uses are read-only and whether language or macro definitions prevent adding const, and (3) whether any macros or globals introduce implicit modification that would preclude const qualification."
