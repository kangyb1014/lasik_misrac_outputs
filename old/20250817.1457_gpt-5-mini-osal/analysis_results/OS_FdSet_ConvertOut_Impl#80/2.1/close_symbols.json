  "explanation": "For MISRA C unreachable-code analysis we must determine whether any branch or statement in OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl can never be reached. Each listed symbol is needed as follows:\n\n- OS_FdSet (definition): The function iterates over sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids) and accesses object_ids[offset] and clears bits in OSAL_set->object_ids[offset]. To know the loop bounds and which id values are represented (offset*8 + bit), the element type and the array length of object_ids are required.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro/function): id is computed as OSAL_INDEX_C((offset * 8) + bit). This conversion may alter the numeric value (e.g. cast, clamp, encoding). To determine whether the subsequent id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES test or indexing into OS_impl_filehandle_table can ever be true/false, the exact definition of this macro is required.\n\n- osal_index_t (typedef): The range (signed/unsigned, width) affects comparisons and indexing semantics (possible wrap/convert). Needed to reason about id values and whether certain comparisons/indices are possible or always false.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (constant): The branch if ( ... && id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES) depends directly on this limit. Knowing its value relative to the number of bits represented by object_ids determines whether that conditional (and thus inner body) can ever be taken.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (array and element type, including .fd and table length): The code reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd. To determine whether indexing is valid and whether the subsequent condition (osfd < 0 || !FD_ISSET(osfd, OS_set)) can be true or always true/false, we need the table size and the semantics/possible values of fd.\n\n- fd_set definition and FD_ISSET macro/function: The !FD_ISSET(osfd, OS_set) check semantics (how FD_ISSET behaves for given fd values) are needed to know if that part of the condition can ever be true. Also to judge whether calling FD_ISSET with certain osfd values is well-defined or guarded by the osfd < 0 check.\n\n- uint8 (typedef): object_ids elements are assigned to objids (uint8). Knowing the width (typically 8 bits) and signedness is necessary to reason about the bit loop (bit runs 0..7 and objids >>= 1) and whether shifts/masks operate as intended; this affects reachability of the inner loop body.\n\n- CHAR_BIT / integer width guarantees: If not implicit from uint8, the exact bit width assumptions (8 bits per byte) are needed to reason about the (1 << bit) mask and ensure the bit index range is valid; this affects whether the clearing operation can be evaluated or causes undefined behavior.\n\nProviding these symbols lets an analyst determine which branches/blocks can never execute (e.g., id always >= OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES, table indexing always invalid, objids always zero, FD_ISSET always true/false) and therefore whether unreachable code exists."
