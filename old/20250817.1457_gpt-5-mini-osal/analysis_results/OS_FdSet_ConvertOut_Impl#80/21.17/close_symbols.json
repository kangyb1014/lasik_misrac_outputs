This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required to determine compliance with the cited MISRA C rule about use of the string.h functions. The target function contains no calls to any string-handling library functions (memcpy, memset, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, memcmp, memmove, etc.). The provided static call graph shows OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl has no callees, so there is no indirect call to any string.h function from this function. Therefore the function cannot violate the specified rule.\n\n(If you want a broader safety analysis unrelated to the string.h rule \u2014 e.g. to check for array/index/bit-shift UB or fd_set bounds \u2014 the following symbols would be needed: definition of OS_FdSet and the object_ids member (type and length), OSAL_INDEX_C macro, typedef of osal_index_t, OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES, definition and length of OS_impl_filehandle_table and its element type (fd field), definition of uint8, the fd_set type and FD_ISSET macro and FD_SETSIZE. Those are not required for deciding the specific string.h usage rule.)"
