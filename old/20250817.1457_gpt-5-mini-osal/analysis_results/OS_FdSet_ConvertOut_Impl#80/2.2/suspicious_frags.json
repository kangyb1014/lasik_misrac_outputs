Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other fragments in this function were not selected because they are clearly required for the algorithm and are not obviously dead code: the local variables are all referenced; the inner loop control (while (objids != 0), the bit increment ++bit and the right-shift objids >>= 1) drive the iteration over bits and are necessary for correct traversal; the function signature and the fd_set/OS_FdSet parameters are used and required; the mask test (objids & 0x01) and the write-back into OSAL_set make visible state changes. The selected fragments are highlighted because they contain conditional checks, table accesses, or writes whose removal or redundancy is not obviously provable from this snippet alone and therefore should be investigated for possible dead operations (for example: redundant bounds checks, unused table lookups, or writes that do not affect program behaviour in the broader context)."
