  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl:\n```c\nstatic void OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl(fd_set *OS_set, OS_FdSet *OSAL_set)\n{\n    size_t       offset;\n    size_t       bit;\n    osal_index_t id;\n    uint8        objids;\n    int          osfd;\n\n    for (offset = 0; offset < sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids); ++offset)\n    {\n        objids = OSAL_set->object_ids[offset];\n        bit    = 0;\n        while (objids != 0)\n        {\n            id = OSAL_INDEX_C((offset * 8) + bit);\n            if ((objids & 0x01) != 0 && id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES)\n            {\n                osfd = OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd;\n                if (osfd < 0 || !FD_ISSET(osfd, OS_set))\n                {\n                    OSAL_set->object_ids[offset] &= ~(1 << bit);\n                }\n            }\n            ++bit;\n            objids >>= 1;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nobjids = OSAL_set->object_ids[offset];\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment initializes the local variable 'objids' which is then tested in the subsequent while (objids != 0) loop and shifted inside that loop. Removing this assignment would change program behaviour (the loop would operate on an indeterminate value), so the operation is not dead code."
