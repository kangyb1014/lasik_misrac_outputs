  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl violates the MISRA rule (a function parameter shall not be modified \u2014 pointer parameters themselves must not be reassigned, though the objects they point to may be changed), the analyzer must know whether any symbol used in the function could mutate the pointer parameters (OS_set or OSAL_set) rather than only the objects they point to. The required symbols and reasons:\n\n- FD_ISSET: This is used with OS_set. FD_ISSET is usually a macro; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not perform any write or side-effect on its first argument (OS_set) or otherwise reassign the pointer parameter.\n\n- fd_set (type definition): The concrete definition of fd_set clarifies whether operations or macros that take fd_set * could modify the fd_set object or require passing by value/pointer in ways that could hide pointer modification. It also documents expected semantics of FD_ISSET.\n\n- OS_FdSet (type/struct) and its member object_ids: The code directly writes to OSAL_set->object_ids[offset]. The struct definition is needed to confirm that object_ids is a member of the object pointed to by OSAL_set (i.e., modification is of the pointed-to object, which is allowed) and to know the member type and layout (array vs pointer) so the change is not actually a hidden reassignment of OSAL_set itself.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C: This macro/function computes id. Its definition must be examined for side effects; if it were to modify OSAL_set or other parameters via hidden state, that could violate the rule.\n\n- osal_index_t: The typedef/underlying type of id is needed to understand the semantics of the index computation and any casting side-effects in OSAL_INDEX_C.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (declaration and element type, including .fd): Accessing OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd must be confirmed not to cause indirect modifications to OS_set or OSAL_set (e.g., via complex macros or overloaded constructs). The element type also confirms .fd is an int read-only here.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: The bound check uses this symbol; while not directly related to pointer modification, it may affect control flow and thus whether certain writes occur. Including it ensures full understanding of whether the code path that writes into OSAL_set->object_ids can be taken.\n\n- uint8 (typedef): To ensure the bitwise operations and assignments operate on the expected object types (object_ids elements) and are not using an abstruse macro/type that could hide pointer reassignments.\n\nWith these definitions, an analyzer can verify that the function only mutates the object pointed to by OSAL_set (allowed) and does not reassign or otherwise modify the pointer parameters themselves (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
