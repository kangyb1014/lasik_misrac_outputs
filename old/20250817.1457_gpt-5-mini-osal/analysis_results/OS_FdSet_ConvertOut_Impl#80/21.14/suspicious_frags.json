  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for Rule 21.14 are present. The function contains no calls to memcmp (or strcmp/strncmp) and does not operate on char* or null-terminated strings. It only uses integer and bitwise operations on OSAL_set->object_ids (uint8), size_t indices, and an integer file descriptor with FD_ISSET. Therefore there is nothing in this code that could violate the prohibition on using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings."
