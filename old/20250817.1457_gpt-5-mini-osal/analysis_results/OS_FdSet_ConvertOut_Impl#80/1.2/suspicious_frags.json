  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: static function scope, ordinary declarations (size_t, int, custom typedefs), pointer usage, bitwise and shift operations, sizeof, and macros/typedefs that are project or platform provided (e.g. FD_ISSET, fd_set, uint8, osal_index_t, OSAL_INDEX_C). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm/asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... ; }) GCC extensions, nested functions, anonymous structures/unions (as an extension), or other vendor-specific keywords. Project-specific macros/types should be reviewed in their own headers, but they are not compiler language extensions by themselves. Therefore no code fragments here need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
