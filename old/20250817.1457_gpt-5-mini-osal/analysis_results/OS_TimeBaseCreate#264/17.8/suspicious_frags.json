  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in this function. Details:\n- timer_id: only checked by OS_CHECK_POINTER(timer_id) and passed to OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew(return_code, &token, timer_id). The function may write the pointee (*timer_id) which is allowed by the rule, but the timer_id pointer itself is not reassigned or modified in this function.\n- timebase_name: only passed to validation and allocation calls (OS_CHECK_APINAME, OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_OBJECT_INIT) and used as a const input; it is not assigned to or altered.\n- external_sync: read and stored into the timebase record (timebase->external_sync = external_sync) and compared against NULL; the parameter variable external_sync itself is not modified.\n- The local token variable is passed by address to other functions, but that does not modify any function parameter.\n- No statements in the function assign to timer_id, timebase_name, or external_sync, so there is no apparent violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
