Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TaskMatch_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskMatch_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token);\n\n    if (pthread_equal(pthread_self(), impl->id) == 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskMatch_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_task_internal_record_t OS_impl_task_table[OS_MAX_TASKS]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_t id;\n} OS_impl_task_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\ntypedef int32_t   int32\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nimpl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token); is used immediately after to access impl->id in the pthread_equal() call. Removing this assignment would change program behaviour (impl would be indeterminate), so it is not dead code. The macro and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken have no hidden side-effects, so the operation is necessary and therefore does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
