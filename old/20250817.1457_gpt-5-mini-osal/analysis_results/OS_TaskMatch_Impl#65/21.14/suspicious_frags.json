  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other byte-wise comparisons used to compare null-terminated strings) are present in the provided code. The function OS_TaskMatch_Impl compares pthread_t values using pthread_equal, not memcmp. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken operate on an index field (token->obj_idx) and return a pointer into an array; no string handling is involved. The OS_impl_task_internal_record_t stores a pthread_t id (not a C string). Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If additional source files or omitted portions (ellipsis) exist, those should be searched for any memcmp calls comparing null-terminated strings, but none appear in the given fragments."
