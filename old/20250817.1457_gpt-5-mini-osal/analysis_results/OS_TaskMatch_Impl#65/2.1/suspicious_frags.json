  "explanation": "Other parts of the snippet do not present unreachable code and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: the function signature and the pointer declaration (\"int32 OS_TaskMatch_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\" and \"OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;\") are structural and always 'present' when the function is compiled/entered, not executable paths by themselves. The macro/constant definitions provided (OS_impl_task_table array, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken inline, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS) are data/inline utility or compile-time constants and do not themselves constitute control-flow code that could be unreachable. Braces and the final closing of the function are syntactic. The flagged fragments cover the points where control flow (the table lookup, the pthread_equal test, and the two return statements) could produce or mask unreachable code depending on the expansion/behavior of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, the validity of token, and the runtime result of pthread_equal; those are the places requiring investigation for potential unreachable code per MISRA C Rule 2.1."
