  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies the function parameter token or the pointer itself. Details:\n- The parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token (pointer-to-const). The only use is dereferencing (*token) in the call to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET. That is a read access; there is no assignment to *token or to token itself.\n- There is no assignment, pointer arithmetic, or reassignment involving token anywhere in the function body.\n- The rest of the code (the pthread_equal call and impl usage) operates on impl and impl->id, not on token.\n- Even if the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET were to attempt to assign to its second argument, passing *token (an lvalue of const-qualified type) would cause a compile-time error unless the macro unsafely casts away const; such an unsafe cast would be a separate, explicit violation but is not shown in this function. Based on the code shown, there are no modifications of the parameter or the pointer itself, so no fragments require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8."
