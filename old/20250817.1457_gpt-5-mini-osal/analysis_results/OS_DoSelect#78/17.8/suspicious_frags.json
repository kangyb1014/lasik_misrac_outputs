  "explanation": "No function parameters are modified in this function. Specifically:\n- maxfd and msecs are only read (compared/used in expressions) and never assigned to.\n- The pointer parameters rd_set and wr_set are passed to select but the pointer variables themselves are not reassigned; only the objects they point to may be altered by select, which is allowed by the rule.\n- All other assignments (tvptr, tv, ts_end, ts_now, os_status, return_code) operate on local variables. \nTherefore there are no code fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing requires further investigation with respect to that rule."
