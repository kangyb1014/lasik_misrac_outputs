  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they are used as modifiable outputs or are intentionally modified: the parameter 'OS_count_sem_prop_t *count_prop' is written to (memset and subsequent assignments), so it cannot be const-qualified; the local token variable is passed by address to OS_ObjectIdGetById and OS_ObjectIdRelease and is expected to be modified by those calls; OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl is called with the token and the count_prop and likely updates count_prop, so those pointer arguments are not candidates for const. The calls to memset and strncpy on count_prop also demonstrate mutation of the pointed-to object. Therefore these pointer usages are appropriate as non-const and do not need further investigation for this rule."
