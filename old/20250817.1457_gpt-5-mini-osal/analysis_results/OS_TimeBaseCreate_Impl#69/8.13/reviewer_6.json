  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Rule 8.13 advises that a pointer should be to a const-qualified type when the pointed-to object is not modified, but the code shown does not actually introduce a MISRA violation in this function: the only pointer being forwarded as an opaque argument is arg.opaque_arg, which is passed directly to the task/thread-creation API (OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl / ultimately pthread_create). Those APIs require the argument type void * to match the pthread ABI (void *(*)(void *)), so this function cannot simply change that parameter to const void * without breaking the required interface. Also the token parameter is already const-qualified. If one wanted to satisfy 8.13 locally, the correct approach is to keep the external API signature (void *) for compatibility and ensure the entry routine treats the data as read-only (or provide an internal const-taking wrapper and cast at the pthread boundary). In short, the claimed violation misapplies the rule to an API boundary where void * is required, so the report is false."
