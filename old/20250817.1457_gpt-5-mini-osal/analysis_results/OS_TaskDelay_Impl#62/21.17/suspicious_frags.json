  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The provided function OS_TaskDelay_Impl does not call any of the standard string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). There are no uses of those identifiers or any direct string or buffer copy/concatenation operations in the code fragment. The other symbols and operations (clock_gettime, clock_nanosleep, timespec arithmetic, integer division/modulo, the OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS macros and typedefs) do not involve <string.h> APIs and therefore are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and need not be investigated for this rule."
