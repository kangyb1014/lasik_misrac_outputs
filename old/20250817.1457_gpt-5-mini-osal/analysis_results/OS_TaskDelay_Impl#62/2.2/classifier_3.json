Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TaskDelay_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskDelay_Impl(uint32 millisecond)\n{\n    struct timespec sleep_end;\n    int             status;\n\n    clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &sleep_end);\n    sleep_end.tv_sec += millisecond / 1000;\n    sleep_end.tv_nsec += 1000000 * (millisecond % 1000);\n\n    if (sleep_end.tv_nsec >= 1000000000)\n    {\n        sleep_end.tv_nsec -= 1000000000;\n        ++sleep_end.tv_sec;\n    }\n\n    do\n    {\n        status = clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME, &sleep_end, NULL);\n    } while (status == EINTR);\n\n    if (status != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskDelay_Impl:\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndo\n    {\n        status = clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME, &sleep_end, NULL);\n    } while (status == EINTR);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The do/while loop repeatedly calls clock_nanosleep while status == EINTR to handle interrupted sleep calls (e.g., due to signals). These operations are executed and removing the loop would change program behaviour (failed/restarted sleeps would not be retried), so this is not dead code."
