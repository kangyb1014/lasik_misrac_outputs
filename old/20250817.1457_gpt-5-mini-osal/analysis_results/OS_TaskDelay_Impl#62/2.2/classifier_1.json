  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TaskDelay_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskDelay_Impl(uint32 millisecond)\n{\n    struct timespec sleep_end;\n    int             status;\n\n    clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &sleep_end);\n    sleep_end.tv_sec += millisecond / 1000;\n    sleep_end.tv_nsec += 1000000 * (millisecond % 1000);\n\n    if (sleep_end.tv_nsec >= 1000000000)\n    {\n        sleep_end.tv_nsec -= 1000000000;\n        ++sleep_end.tv_sec;\n    }\n\n    do\n    {\n        status = clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME, &sleep_end, NULL);\n    } while (status == EINTR);\n\n    if (status != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskDelay_Impl:\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (sleep_end.tv_nsec >= 1000000000)\n    {\n        sleep_end.tv_nsec -= 1000000000;\n        ++sleep_end.tv_sec;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment normalizes the timespec when the nanoseconds field overflows. For example, if clock_gettime returns sleep_end.tv_nsec = 900000000 and millisecond = 200, then sleep_end.tv_nsec becomes 1100000000; the if-block reduces it to 100000000 and increments sleep_end.tv_sec. Removing this code would change the absolute time passed to clock_nanosleep (and may cause an error or incorrect delay), so the operations are executed and affect behaviour. Hence this is not dead code."
