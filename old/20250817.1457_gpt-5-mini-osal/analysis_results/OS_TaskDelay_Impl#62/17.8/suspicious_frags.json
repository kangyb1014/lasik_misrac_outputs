  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the function has a single parameter (uint32 millisecond) that is only read, never assigned to or modified (no assignment to millisecond, no increment/decrement, and its address is not taken). There are no pointer parameters in the function signature (so the clause about not modifying pointer parameters is not applicable). The only pointer used is &sleep_end, which is a pointer to a local object (allowed: the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, and here no pointer parameter exists). All modifications (e.g. sleep_end.tv_sec += ..., sleep_end.tv_nsec += ..., ++sleep_end.tv_sec) affect a local variable, not the function parameter. Therefore no code fragments need to be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
