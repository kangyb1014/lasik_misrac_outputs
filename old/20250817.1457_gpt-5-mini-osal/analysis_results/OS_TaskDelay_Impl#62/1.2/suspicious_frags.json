  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided function. The code only uses: standard C constructs (function, local variable declarations, arithmetic, do/while, if/else, return, prefix ++), typedefs that map to stdint types (uint32, int32), and POSIX time APIs/macros (struct timespec, clock_gettime, clock_nanosleep, CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME, EINTR). There are no compiler-specific keywords or extensions present (for example: __attribute__, __asm, asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({:}), zero-length arrays, MSVC/GCC-specific pragmas or keywords). The macros OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS are ordinary macros, and the arithmetic/manipulation of tv_sec/tv_nsec uses only standard integer operations. Therefore there are no fragments that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If the target compiler explicitly documents any of the used functions/macros as language extensions (which would be unusual), they should be reported, but based on the code alone none are present."
