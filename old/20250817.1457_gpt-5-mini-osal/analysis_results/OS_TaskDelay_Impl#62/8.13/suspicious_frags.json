  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning: \n- The address of sleep_end is passed to clock_gettime, which writes into the object, so a non-const pointer is required and sleep_end cannot be declared const. \n- The same address is later passed to clock_nanosleep; that API declares the request parameter as const struct timespec *, so the implicit conversion from struct timespec * to const struct timespec * is appropriate and no const-qualification of the local object is possible earlier because it is modified. \n- The final NULL argument corresponds to the optional remain pointer; passing NULL is correct and there is no pointer object to qualify with const. \n- There are no other pointer variables or pointer-to-object usages in this function that could or should be const-qualified. Therefore no fragments need further investigation under Rule 8.13."
