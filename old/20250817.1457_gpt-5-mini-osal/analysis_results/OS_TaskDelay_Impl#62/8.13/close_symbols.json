  "explanation": "For verifying MISRA C's \u201cpointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d in OS_TaskDelay_Impl you must know the exact types and const-qualification of the called APIs and the involved objects:\n\n- struct timespec (definition): needed to know whether its fields are objects or pointers and whether any member is a pointer that itself would need const-qualification. In this function timespec is a local aggregate, so confirming its layout shows there are no hidden pointer members.\n\n- clock_gettime(...) prototype: the function is called with &sleep_end. To determine whether the pointer should be const, you must know if clock_gettime accepts a const or non-const pointer (it writes to tp), so its prototype shows it takes struct timespec * (non-const), which justifies non-const usage.\n\n- clock_nanosleep(...) prototype: called with &sleep_end as the request parameter. Its prototype indicates whether that parameter is const-qualified (it is typically const struct timespec *request). If the function's API already requires const, then the call is compatible and no change is required; if it required non-const, that would be relevant to the MISRA check.\n\n- typedef clockid_t (underlying integer type): present in the function prototypes; needed to match signatures precisely (not directly about const, but required to interpret the function prototypes above).\n\n- CLOCK_MONOTONIC (macro/constant) and TIMER_ABSTIME (macro/constant): these are used as arguments to the clock functions; knowing their types/values is not about const-qualification of pointers, but required to fully resolve the called API signatures and their semantics.\n\n- EINTR (macro/constant from errno.h): used in the loop condition comparing status; needed to ensure correct type comparison and to show that status is an int error code from the system call. While not directly a pointer-const issue, it is required to understand whether status is used correctly from the called APIs.\n\n- typedefs for int32 and uint32 (definitions): needed to know the exact integer types used for return and parameter types of OS_TaskDelay_Impl; MISRA analyses often require precise types (signedness/width) to reason about conversions and API contracts.\n\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS (macro/enum values): the function returns these values; including them clarifies the return-type contract and whether any pointer-to-const concerns might propagate via return codes or API expectations.\n\nIn short: the timespec definition and the exact prototypes (and related typedefs/constants) for clock_gettime and clock_nanosleep are the critical symbols to determine whether the function passes non-const pointers where a const-qualified pointer should be used. The other listed symbols provide the necessary context to interpret those prototypes and the function's behavior in a MISRA analysis."
