  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 prohibits using the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. I inspected the provided function and its related symbol definitions and found no use of memcmp or any other standard string-comparison functions. The function only manipulates a struct timespec, integer arithmetic, and calls clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep; there are no char* or string objects, no string headers referenced, and no comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need to be investigated for Rule 21.14."
