  "suspicious_frags": [
    "if (OS_TaskPrepare(task_id, &task_entry) == OS_SUCCESS)",

  ],
  "explanation": "All pointer-related operations in this function are listed above: the local pointer-like declaration (osal_task_entry task_entry), taking its address to pass to OS_TaskPrepare, testing it against NULL, and dereferencing/calling it. These are the only locations where a pointer-to-type appears or is manipulated in this snippet; other text (task_id parameter, OS_TASKPrepare call invocation aside from the &task_entry argument, the OS_SUCCESS comparison, the final OS_TaskExit call, comments and control flow) do not introduce additional pointer targets that would be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 and therefore do not need investigation here."
