  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment only compares the pointer task_entry to NULL; Rule 8.13 concerns whether a pointer's target type should be const-qualified. This line does not affect or demonstrate the const-qualification of the pointed-to type. Moreover, osal_task_entry is likely a function-pointer type (functions cannot be cv\u2011qualified), so the rule is not applicable here. A concrete violation scenario would be if a pointer to data that is not modified were declared without const (for example, using 'char *p' when it should be 'const char *p'), but that is not shown by this fragment."
