  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The fragment calls through a function pointer variable (osal_task_entry task_entry). Function types cannot be const-qualified in C, so you cannot make the pointee a const-qualified function type. Also the local variable must be assignable because OS_TaskPrepare(&task_entry) initializes it, so making the pointer itself const is not possible here. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated for the call expression (*task_entry)()."
