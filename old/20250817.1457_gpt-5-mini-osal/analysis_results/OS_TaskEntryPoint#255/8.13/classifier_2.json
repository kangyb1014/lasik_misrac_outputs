  "scenario": "Assuming the common OS pattern where osal_task_entry is a function-pointer typedef (e.g. typedef void (*osal_task_entry)(void)), there is no violation: function types cannot be const-qualified, so Rule 8.13 does not apply. A violation would occur if osal_task_entry were a pointer-to-object type that could/should be to a const-qualified type (for example typedef int *osal_task_entry; and the pointed-to int is not modified \u2014 it should be typedef const int *osal_task_entry;), in which case declaring 'osal_task_entry task_entry;' would violate Rule 8.13."
