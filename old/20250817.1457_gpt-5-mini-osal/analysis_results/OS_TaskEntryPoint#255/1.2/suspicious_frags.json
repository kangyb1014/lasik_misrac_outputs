  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code. The items inspected and reasons they are not suspicious: \n\n- typedef of function-pointer (typedef osal_task((*osal_task_entry)(void))): this is standard C function-pointer typedef syntax (parentheses and pointer notation are normal C), not a compiler extension. \n- Invocation (*task_entry)();: explicit dereference and call of a function pointer is standard C. \n- OS_TaskPrepare, OS_TaskExit, and the conditional checks (if (...) == OS_SUCCESS, if (task_entry != NULL)): all use standard C constructs. \n- Macro definition #define OS_SUCCESS (0): a plain macro, not an extension. \n- typedef uint32 osal_id_t: use of a typedef name for an integer type is standard; the identifier uint32 is an application/platform-defined type, not inherently a compiler extension. \n\nNo occurrences of known compiler extensions were found (for example: __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement expressions, pragmas that change language, nonstandard keywords, vendor built-ins, inline asm, leading/trailing commas in enums, etc.). Therefore there are no fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
