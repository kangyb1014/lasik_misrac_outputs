  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_TaskEntryPoint could lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses via string.h functions you must inspect the implementations and relevant types of the functions it invokes and the types/macros it uses: \n\n- OS_TaskPrepare: The entry point calls this to obtain the task_entry; OS_TaskPrepare's implementation must be inspected for any use of string functions (memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc.) or for preparing buffers/pointers that could later be passed to string functions. \n- OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_TaskMatch_Impl, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_NotifyEvent: These are direct callees of OS_TaskPrepare. Any of them may manipulate object name buffers, indices, tokens, or copy memory; their source is required to see whether string functions are used safely and whether they produce/return pointers or buffer lengths that could be out of bounds. \n- OS_TaskExit: OS_TaskEntryPoint always calls this on return; its implementation must be examined for string function usage and for cleanup operations that access object names/buffers. \n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl, OS_TaskDetach_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete, OS_TaskExit_Impl, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: These are direct callees of OS_TaskExit. Each may perform memory or string operations during task cleanup (e.g., name handling, event messages, handlers); inspect them for unsafe string usage or buffer size assumptions. \n- osal_task_entry: The type of the task entry pointer; you need its definition to confirm calling convention and whether any wrapper/indirection could pass buffers to string functions. Also confirms whether a NULL check is sufficient. \n- osal_id_t: The task identifier type used by OS_TaskPrepare; its layout/semantic may be relevant to functions that index object tables and access name buffers. \n- OS_SUCCESS: The status macro/enum value used to decide whether the returned task_entry is valid; needed to understand all return paths and whether failure paths might leave pointers uninitialized or lead to alternative code paths that use string functions.\n\nIn short: inspect the implementations of the listed callees (and the definitions of the listed types/macros) to find any uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn etc., and verify that size/length arguments and destination/source buffers are correctly bounded. These symbols cover the code paths that prepare the task entry and perform exit/cleanup where string/buffer operations are most likely to occur."
