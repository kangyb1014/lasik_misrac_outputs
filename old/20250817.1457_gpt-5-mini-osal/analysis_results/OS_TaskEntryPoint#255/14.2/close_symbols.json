The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Rationale for each symbol (concise):\n\n- OS_TaskPrepare: Direct callee of OS_TaskEntryPoint. Must be inspected for any for-loops and for any modifications to objects that could be used as loop counters or control flags in a surrounding for loop (MISRA counts behaviour of called functions as part of a for-loop body).\n\n- OS_TaskExit: Direct callee executed after OS_TaskEntryPoint returns. Inspect its body for for-loops and for side effects that could interact with loop counters or control flags if OS_TaskExit were invoked inside a for loop in other contexts.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: Callee of OS_TaskPrepare and OS_TaskExit. Needed to check for internal for-loops or persistent side effects that could affect loop well-formedness when called from a for-loop body.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Callee of OS_TaskPrepare. Needed to determine whether it contains for-loops or modifies objects that a surrounding for-loop might use as counters or control flags.\n\n- OS_TaskMatch_Impl: Callee of OS_TaskPrepare. Must be checked for loops or modifications to shared objects that could violate the MISRA constraints when treated as part of a for-loop body.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdRelease: Callee of OS_TaskPrepare. Inspect for loops or side-effects that would count toward the behaviour of a for-loop body.\n\n- OS_TaskRegister_Impl: Callee of OS_TaskPrepare. Needed to see whether it contains for-loops or modifies objects that could be loop counters/flags.\n\n- OS_NotifyEvent: Callee of OS_TaskPrepare. Include to check for loops or persistent side-effects (e.g., global state modifications) relevant to loop-well-formedness analysis.\n\n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl: Callee of OS_TaskExit. Needed to check for any for-loops or side effects relevant to MISRA rule when OS_TaskExit is used in loop contexts.\n\n- OS_TaskDetach_Impl: Callee of OS_TaskExit. Inspect for loops or modifications of objects that could be considered loop counters or control flags.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: Callee of OS_TaskExit. Check for loops or persistent side-effects affecting loop correctness.\n\n- OS_TaskExit_Impl: Callee of OS_TaskExit. Must be analyzed for loops and side-effects because it is part of the overall behaviour of OS_TaskExit.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: Callee of OS_TaskExit. Include to detect any for-loops or side-effects performed during the exit sequence.\n\n- osal_task_entry: Typedef of the function-pointer invoked by OS_TaskEntryPoint. Required to understand the signature/ semantics of the called function (its possible side-effects and whether it could contain for-loops that would be counted as part of the call site behaviour).\n\n- osal_id_t: Type of the task_id parameter. Required to interpret ID handling code in callees (e.g., index/token functions) which may influence whether loops iterate over structures derived from task_id.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: Macro/constant used in the decision to call task_entry. Needed to determine branch outcome and whether the task_entry invocation (which could contain for-loops) occurs.\n\nNote: MISRA\u2019s for-loop rule requires analysing the behaviour of any functions called from within a for-loop body. Although OS_TaskEntryPoint itself contains no for-loops, to be conservative and complete we must inspect all direct callees and their callees (listed above) to detect any for-loops or side-effects that could participate in a for-loop elsewhere or if OS_TaskEntryPoint were inlined/used in a loop. These symbols are the minimal set (functions, typedefs, and constants) required to perform that inspection."
