  "explanation": "1) osal_id_t: MISRA's rule is about modifying a function parameter. To determine whether \"task_id\" is a pointer (and thus whether the object it points to vs. the pointer itself is relevant) we must know the exact typedef/underlying type of osal_id_t (e.g. integral type, pointer type, struct). If osal_id_t is a pointer type then the distinction between modifying the pointer vs. the pointee matters.  \n\n2) osal_task_entry: This is the type of the local variable task_entry. Knowing whether it is a function-pointer type (and its qualifiers) is necessary to ensure that the call (*task_entry)() does not implicitly modify the task_id parameter (for example via unusual calling conventions or by aliasing). At minimum it confirms that the local is not an alias to task_id.\n\n3) OS_TaskPrepare (prototype/signature and, if available, implementation): OS_TaskPrepare is called with task_id as an argument and returns status plus fills task_entry. The prototype tells whether the function is declared to take osal_id_t by value or by pointer/reference (e.g. osal_id_t or osal_id_t *). If it takes a pointer to task_id or somehow receives an lvalue that could alias the caller's parameter, that affects whether task_id could be modified. If the prototype is ambiguous, the implementation is needed to see casts or macros that could mutate the caller's parameter.  \n\n4) OS_TaskExit (prototype/signature and, if available, implementation): OS_TaskExit is called after the body and might be a macro or inline wrapper that uses/changes task-local storage or even refer to the caller's parameter via macro tricks. Knowing its prototype/definition rules out any surprising mechanism by which calling OS_TaskExit could modify the parameter variable in the caller (e.g. if OS_TaskExit were a macro that expands to code that assigns to task_id).  \n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the parameter variable task_id (the pointer value if it is a pointer type) is ever assigned to or otherwise modified within OS_TaskEntryPoint (directly in its body or indirectly via macros/wrapper definitions), and thus whether the function violates the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified."
