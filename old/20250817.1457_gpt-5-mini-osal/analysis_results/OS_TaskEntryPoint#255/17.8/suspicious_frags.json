  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter (osal_id_t task_id) which is only used as an argument in the call OS_TaskPrepare(task_id, &task_entry). There are no assignments to task_id, no increments/decrements, and no pointer reassignments of a parameter. The only other pointer manipulation is &task_entry (address of a local variable) and later dereferencing task_entry to call the function it points to; these operate on a local variable, not on a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that modify a parameter and nothing needs further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
