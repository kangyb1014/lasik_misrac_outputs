  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for unreachable code in OS_TaskEntryPoint:\n\n- OS_TaskPrepare: The return value controls the outer if. Knowing its possible return values and conditions is required to decide whether the block containing task_entry and the call through it is ever skipped (unreachable) or always taken.\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_TaskMatch_Impl, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_NotifyEvent: These are OS_TaskPrepare's callees. Their control flow, error paths and side effects determine whether OS_TaskPrepare can return OS_SUCCESS, set task_entry non-NULL, or perform non-local control transfers (longjmp, thread termination) that would make code in OS_TaskEntryPoint unreachable.\n- OS_TaskExit: Called unconditionally at the end of OS_TaskEntryPoint. You must know whether it returns normally or never returns (terminates the thread/process) to determine reachability of any code after the call (and to reason about whether earlier calls leading into it are effectively the function exit point).\n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl, OS_TaskDetach_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete, OS_TaskExit_Impl, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: These are OS_TaskExit's callees. Their behavior may make OS_TaskExit non-returning or may perform non-local exits; their control-flow/termination behavior affects reachability analysis of code in OS_TaskEntryPoint and any subsequent code paths.\n- osal_task_entry: The typedef for task_entry (function-pointer type). You need its exact type/signature to understand whether calling through it could invoke a non-returning function or has other calling/ABI implications relevant to reachability.\n- osal_id_t: The type of the task_id parameter; necessary if the type constrains valid token/ID ranges which could make certain OS_TaskPrepare/OS_TaskExit paths unreachable depending on invalid/valid IDs.\n- OS_SUCCESS: The constant used in the comparison. Knowing its value/meaning and how OS_TaskPrepare maps to it is required to decide which branch is taken.\n- NULL: The value used to test task_entry for a valid function pointer. Understanding what NULL means in this environment is needed to determine whether the call-through can be reached.\n- noreturn/termination annotations (e.g. OS_NORETURN or __attribute__((noreturn))): Any attribute or macro that marks OS_TaskExit or functions invoked via task_entry as non-returning must be known; such annotations directly affect reachability (code after a noreturn call is unreachable).\n\nIncluding the above symbols (the direct callees and their callees, the typedefs and macros, and any non-return annotations) gives the next analyst the control-flow and type information required to determine whether any statements in OS_TaskEntryPoint are provably unreachable under the project's implementations."
