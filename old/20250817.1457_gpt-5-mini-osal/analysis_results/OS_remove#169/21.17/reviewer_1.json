  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_remove code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_remove.\n```c\nint32 OS_remove(const char *path)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    char  local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_FileRemove_Impl(local_path);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The call memchr(s, 0, maxlen) can read up to maxlen bytes from s. If s points to an object whose actual size is less than maxlen and there is no terminating '\\0' within that object, memchr will access bytes beyond the object's bounds. In this code OS_strnlen(VirtualPath, OS_MAX_PATH_LEN) is invoked with an arbitrary VirtualPath (checked only for NULL), so if VirtualPath refers to a shorter non\u2011terminated buffer (length < OS_MAX_PATH_LEN and no '\\0' within), the memchr call will read out of bounds.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\ntypedef int32_t int32;\nextern int32 OS_TranslatePath(const char *path, char *local_path);\nextern int32 OS_FileRemove_Impl(const char *local_path);\nstatic const char LOG_FILE[] = \"/tmp/logs/1359.txt\";\nstatic void ensure_log_dir(void)\n{\n    /* Attempt to create the directory; ignore errors other than missing directory. */\n    (void)mkdir(\"/tmp/logs\", 0755);\n}\nstatic void append_log(const char *msg)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(LOG_FILE, \"a\");\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        ensure_log_dir();\n        f = fopen(LOG_FILE, \"a\");\n        if (!f)\n        {\n            /* If logging is impossible, silently return to avoid changing program behavior. */\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    fputs(msg, f);\n    fputc('\\n', f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\nstatic void probe_log_input_pointer(const char *path)\n{\n    char buf[256];\n    int n = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"OS_remove called: path_ptr=%p\", (void *)path);\n    if (n >= 0 && n < (int)sizeof(buf)) append_log(buf);\n\n    if (path == NULL)\n    {\n        append_log(\"path is NULL\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Do not attempt to read the pointed-to bytes here; that could reproduce the\n           very out-of-bounds read we are trying to capture in a controlled manner.\n           Instead, we note that the pointer is non-NULL and allow OS_TranslatePath\n           to operate. */\n        append_log(\"path is non-NULL; contents not dereferenced by probe to avoid OOB reads\");\n    }\n}\nstatic void probe_log_local_path(const char local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN])\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(LOG_FILE, \"a\");\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        ensure_log_dir();\n        f = fopen(LOG_FILE, \"a\");\n        if (!f) return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"Translated local_path buffer (up to %d bytes):\\n\", OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN);\n\n    /* Print as a quoted string up to the first '\\0' or buffer limit. */\n    int i;\n    int found_null = -1;\n    for (i = 0; i < OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN; ++i)\n    {\n        if (local_path[i] == '\\0')\n        {\n            found_null = i;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (found_null >= 0)\n    {\n        /* There is a terminating NUL within bounds; print the string form safely. */\n        fprintf(f, \"  (terminated at index %d) string=\\\"\");\n        /* Print safely by writing in chunks to avoid relying on %s which also scans. */\n        for (i = 0; i < found_null; ++i)\n        {\n            char c = local_path[i];\n            /* Print printable characters directly, otherwise hex escape. */\n            if ((unsigned char)c >= 32 && (unsigned char)c <= 126)\n                fputc(c, f);\n            else\n                fprintf(f, \"\\\\x%02x\", (unsigned char)c);\n        }\n        fprintf(f, \"\\\"\");\n        fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* No terminating NUL found in buffer; print a hexdump of the buffer up to the limit. */\n        fprintf(f, \"  (no terminating NUL found within buffer).

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The code path shown hands an arbitrary const char *path (only checked for NULL in the test probe) into OS_TranslatePath. If OS_TranslatePath implements a length check using strnlen/memchr with a fixed maximum (e.g. memchr(s, 0, maxlen) or strnlen(s, maxlen)), those library calls will read up to maxlen bytes starting at the pointer. If the object actually pointed to is smaller than maxlen and contains no terminating NUL within the object, memchr/strnlen will access bytes beyond the object bounds, which is precisely what MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids. The provided test output shows corrupted/unexpected contents in the translated buffer (and a nonsensical termination index), consistent with an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access having occurred. Therefore the reported violation of Rule 21.17 is correct."
