  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameter is declared as const char *path and is not modified anywhere in this function: there are no assignments to path, no pointer arithmetic (no ++/-- or +=/-=), and no casts that might allow changing the pointer itself. The only uses of path are as an argument to OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path); passing the pointer does not modify the parameter variable inside this function. local_path and return_code are local objects, not function parameters, so they do not violate Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that should be investigated for modification of a function parameter."
