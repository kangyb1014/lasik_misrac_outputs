  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The snippet only contains standard C constructs: a typedef alias (int32 from int32_t), macro-based array sizing (char local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN]) using macro expressions, const-qualified pointer parameter, ordinary function calls and returns, and a plain integer macro (OS_SUCCESS). There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, nested functions, statement expressions, zero-length arrays, flexible-array members, GCC/Clang extensions, MSVC-specific extensions, or other items that compiler documentation would explicitly label as extensions. (If OS_MAX_PATH_LEN or OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN were not integer constant expressions the array would be a variable-length array \u2014 a standard C99 feature \u2014 but that is not a compiler-specific extension.) Therefore there are no fragments to flag under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
