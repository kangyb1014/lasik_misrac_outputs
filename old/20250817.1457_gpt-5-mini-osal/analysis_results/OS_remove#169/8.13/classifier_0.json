  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: local_path is a modifiable array (char local_path[...]) used as an output buffer and will be written by OS_TranslatePath. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types pointing to const-qualified targets when possible; here the object must be writable so it cannot/should not be const. Also, the declaration is an array (not a pointer type), though it decays to char * when passed; making it const would prevent required modification, so the rule is not violated."
