  "explanation": "The parameter 'const char *path' is already const-qualified and thus complies with Rule 8.13; it does not need investigation. The call to OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path) appears to write into local_path (a destination buffer), so local_path must be a modifiable array and cannot be const \u2014 this usage is appropriate and not a Rule 8.13 concern. The return_code variable and the return statement do not involve pointer-to-non-const issues. Therefore the only fragments that merit investigation are the declaration of the local_path buffer (as it decays to a pointer when passed) and the call to OS_FileRemove_Impl(local_path), which may indicate that the implementation API accepts a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer might be appropriate."
