Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other code fragments in OS_QueueGetInfo are not flagged because they are essential to the observable behaviour or are non-executable/comment text: - The declarations (record, return_code, token) are required for subsequent operations. - The call to OS_ObjectIdGetById(...) performs the object lookup/transaction initialization and clearly affects control flow and return value; removing it would change behaviour. - The if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) guard controls whether the record is accessed; both the condition and the assignment record = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) are needed to avoid invalid access. - The comment block is non-executable. - The final return return_code; is required to propagate the status back to the caller. Based on the provided additional definitions, these non-selected fragments have observable effects (locks/tokens, object-table indexing, and return semantics), so they are not candidates for dead code investigation."
