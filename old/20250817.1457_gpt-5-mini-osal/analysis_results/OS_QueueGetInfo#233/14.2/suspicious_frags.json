  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the correctness of for statements (their three clauses, single loop counter, no modifications of the counter in the body, etc.). In the provided target function OS_QueueGetInfo and the supplied related definitions there are no for statements to inspect:\n\n- OS_QueueGetInfo contains calls (OS_CHECK_POINTER, memset, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, strncpy, OS_ObjectIdRelease) and simple assignments/ifs, but no for loops.\n- The macros/inline used here are simple (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an array indexing expression, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken returns token->obj_idx) and contain no for loops.\n- The provided implementation of OS_ObjectIdGetById contains conditional logic but no for loops. OS_ObjectIdRelease is a simple wrapper.\n\nTherefore there are no for-loop occurrences in the provided code fragments that would trigger investigation under Rule 14.2. Note: the only remaining potential places where for loops could exist are the implementations of external/standard routines not provided here (e.g. memset/strncpy or other OS_ObjectIdTransaction* helpers). If those implementations are part of the checked codebase, their definitions should be inspected for for-statements that might violate Rule 14.2. Since those implementations were not supplied, they cannot be marked here as suspicious fragments."
