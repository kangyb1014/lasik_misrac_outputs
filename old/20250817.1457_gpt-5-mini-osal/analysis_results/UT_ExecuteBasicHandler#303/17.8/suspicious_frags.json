  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: none of the function parameters are modified in this function. There are no assignments, increments/decrements, or reassignments to FuncKey, FunctionName, or DefaultHandler. FunctionName is declared const char * and is not changed; the pointer itself is not reassigned. The parameters are only passed by value to other functions (UT_GetStubEntry, UT_SetHandlerFunction, UT_DefaultStubImpl), which does not constitute modifying the parameter within this function. Therefore no code here violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
