  "explanation": "No code fragments modify a function parameter variable itself. In OS_QueueGetIdByName neither queue_id nor queue_name is assigned to; queue_id is passed to OS_ObjectIdFindByName which may write to *object_id (i.e. the object pointed to) \u2014 this is permitted by Rule 17.8. The OS_CHECK_POINTER macro expands to a test expression (BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL,...)) and does not perform any assignment to the parameter. In OS_ObjectIdFindByName the only assignment is '*object_id = token.obj_id;', which modifies the object pointed to (allowed) and does not change the pointer parameter. queue_name is declared const char * and is not modified. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8."
