  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_QueueGetIdByName code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_QueueGetIdByName.\n```c\nint32 OS_QueueGetIdByName(osal_id_t *queue_id, const char *queue_name)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_name);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindByName(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, queue_name, queue_id);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, ...) macro likely computes the string length (e.g. via strlen) to compare against OS_MAX_API_NAME. Although ARGCHECK(name, ...) ensures name is not NULL, it does not guarantee the pointed-to character array is NUL-terminated within the allowed bounds. If LENGTHCHECK uses strlen (or any other <string.h> function that scans until a NUL), and the caller provides a non-terminated buffer or a pointer whose valid object bound is shorter than the scanned area, the call can read past the object's bounds. This would violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_QueueGetIdByName_LogEntry(const osal_id_t *queue_id, const char *queue_name)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1863.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"OS_QueueGetIdByName ENTRY: queue_id=%p queue_name=%p\\n\",\n                (const void *)queue_id, (const void *)queue_name);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\nstatic void OS_QueueGetIdByName_LogAfterChecks(const osal_id_t *queue_id, const char *queue_name)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1863.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"OS_QueueGetIdByName AFTER_CHECKS: queue_id=%p queue_name=%p\\n\",\n                (const void *)queue_id, (const void *)queue_name);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\nstatic void OS_QueueGetIdByName_LogExit(const osal_id_t *queue_id, const char *queue_name, int32 return_code)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1863.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Cast return_code to long for printing portability */\n        fprintf(f, \"OS_QueueGetIdByName EXIT: return_code=%ld queue_id=%p queue_name=%p\\n\",\n                (long)return_code, (const void *)queue_id, (const void *)queue_name);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nint32 OS_QueueGetIdByName(osal_id_t *queue_id, const char *queue_name)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Log entry state (before the existing pointer checks) so callers\n     * that pass non-terminated buffers or invalid pointers are recorded.\n     * This preserves the original control flow and does not change behavior. */\n    OS_QueueGetIdByName_LogEntry((const osal_id_t *)queue_id, queue_name);\n\n    /* Check Parameters (preserve original checks/macros) */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_name);\n\n    /* Log state after checks passed (this log will not occur if the\n     * OS_CHECK_POINTER macro causes an early return as in the original). */\n    OS_QueueGetIdByName_LogAfterChecks((const osal_id_t *)queue_id, queue_name);\n\n    /* Original call preserved */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindByName(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, queue_name, queue_id);\n\n    /* Log result and final state */\n    OS_QueueGetIdByName_LogExit((const osal_id_t *)queue_id, queue_name, return_code);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n\n```\nAfter executing all tests, we received the following output from the test code.\nFor this task, assume the following:\n- The test suite is exhaustive and has covered all edge cases.\n- There are no missing scenarios.\n- You must not include any caveats or question the test results.\n\nBased on this, analyze the output and validate the scenario accordingly.\n```\nOS_QueueGetIdByName ENTRY: queue_id=(nil) queue_name=0x55ab976a6ecb\nOS_QueueGetIdByName ENTRY: queue_id=0x7fff99f1adac queue_name=(nil)\nOS_QueueGetIdByName ENTRY: queue_id=0x7fff99f1adac queue_name=0x7fff99f1adb0\nOS_QueueGetIdByName AFTER_CHECKS: queue_id=0x7fff99f1adac queue_name=0x7fff99f1adb0\nOS_QueueGetIdByName EXIT: return_code=-13 queue_id=0x7fff99f1adac queue_name=0x7fff99f1adb0\nOS_QueueGetIdByName ENTRY: queue_id=0x7fff99f1adac queue_name=0x55ab976a6f50\nOS_QueueGetIdByName AFTER_CHECKS: queue_id=0x7fff99f1adac queue_name=0x55ab976a6f50\nOS_QueueGetIdByName EXIT: return_code=-17 queue_id=0x7fff99f1adac queue_name=0x55ab976a6f50\n\n```\n\n</test_code>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- explanation: your evaluation of the scenario provided by the agent A.\n- is_report_correct: whether the report is correct or not (true/false)\n</response format>\n<instruction>   \nJudge whether the report is correct or not.\n</instruction>\n",
  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The asserted violation is not correct for the code shown. MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 targets uses of the standard <string.h> functions that can read past the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The OS_QueueGetIdByName implementation provided does not call any <string.h> functions itself; it only performs pointer (NULL) checks via OS_CHECK_POINTER and then delegates to OS_ObjectIdFindByName. Whether any string handling over-read occurs depends entirely on the implementation of OS_ObjectIdFindByName (or any macros it uses, e.g. LENGTHCHECK). A potential unsafe use of strlen (or other <string.h> routines) inside OS_ObjectIdFindByName would be the location of a Rule 21.17 violation, not OS_QueueGetIdByName itself.\n\nThe test output (ENTRY/AFTER_CHECKS/EXIT logs) shows the function is called with various pointer states and that, when the NULL checks pass, the call returns error codes (-13, -17) rather than exhibiting a detected over-read or crash. Given the instruction to accept the tests as exhaustive, the runtime evidence does not demonstrate an out-of-bounds access originating from OS_QueueGetIdByName. Therefore the report that OS_QueueGetIdByName violates MISRA Rule 21.17 is not correct. If the reviewer\u2019s concern is about the use of LENGTHCHECK/strlen, the correct action is to inspect and, if necessary, fix OS_ObjectIdFindByName (or the LENGTHCHECK macro) to ensure any string handling cannot read beyond object bounds; but that is a different translation unit and not a direct violation attributable to OS_QueueGetIdByName."
