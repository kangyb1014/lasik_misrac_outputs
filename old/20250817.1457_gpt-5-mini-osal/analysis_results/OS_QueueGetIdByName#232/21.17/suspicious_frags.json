  "explanation": "Only fragments that pass a const char * name into macros or functions that are likely to perform string operations (and thus may call functions from <string.h>) have been flagged. The following elements were NOT selected because they do not themselves perform string handling and therefore are not directly relevant to Rule 21.17: the pointer null-checks (OS_CHECK_POINTER(...)), simple assignments (e.g. *object_id = token.obj_id;), token/lock handling and release calls (OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish), the function return/typedef lines, and other statements shown that do not operate on character buffers. No direct calls to standard string.h functions appear in the provided fragments; the flagged lines are the places where string handling is likely to occur (inside the macros ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK or inside the name-matching/search routines) and therefore require investigation to ensure they do not access beyond object bounds."
