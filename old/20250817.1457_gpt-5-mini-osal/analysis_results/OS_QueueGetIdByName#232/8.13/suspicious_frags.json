  "explanation": "The only pointer-bearing entities in this function are the two parameters and their uses. queue_name is already const-qualified (const char *), so its occurrences (including OS_CHECK_POINTER(queue_name)) do not need investigation under Rule 8.13. The local variable return_code and the return statement are not pointers and are therefore not relevant to this rule. Other tokens such as the LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE argument are not pointer types in this snippet and do not require investigation for pointer const-qualification."
