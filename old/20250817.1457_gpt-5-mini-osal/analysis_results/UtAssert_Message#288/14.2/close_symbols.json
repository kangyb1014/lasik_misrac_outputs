Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Rationale for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- strrchr\n  - UtAssert_Message calls strrchr. To be sure no hidden for-loop (or loop modifying objects visible to a for statement) exists in the called code that could make the target function violate the MISRA for-loop rule, inspect strrchr implementation.\n\n- snprintf\n  - Called to format FinalMessage. snprintf implementations may contain loops; we must verify they do not rely on or modify any objects accessible to any for-loop in the target function (and do not introduce ill-formed loop behavior when considered as part of any for-loop body).\n\n- strlen\n  - Used to set MsgLen. strlen implementations contain loops; include to confirm they do not create side effects relevant to the MISRA for-loop rule.\n\n- vsnprintf\n  - Called with a va_list to produce the rest of the message; its implementation may include loops or call other functions. Must be inspected for any loop behaviour that could violate the rule if considered part of a for-loop body.\n\n- va_start, va_end, va_list (stdarg.h)\n  - Macros/types used for variadic argument handling. Their expansions or usage could interact with called functions (vsnprintf) and must be known to ensure no for-loop rule violation derives from variadic handling.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText\n  - Direct callee of UtAssert_Message. MISRA\u2019s for-loop rule treats the behaviour of functions called inside a for-loop body as part of that body. Even though UtAssert_Message itself has no for loop, UT_BSP_DoText must be analyzed because (a) it is part of the target\u2019s call-chain and (b) its implementation might contain for loops that modify objects visible to caller-level loops or have persistent side effects that would make a surrounding for loop ill-formed.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText callees: UT_BSP_Lock, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev, OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl, UT_BSP_Unlock, OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl\n  - UT_BSP_DoText calls these functions (per the static call graph). To fully assess UT_BSP_DoText (and therefore the behaviour incorporated into the target function), each of these implementations must be inspected for for-loops, side effects, and modifications to objects that could be used as loop counters or be modified by loop bodies. Any for-loops inside them could cause the combined behaviour (target + callee) to violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- uint8 typedef, uint32 typedef, size_t typedef\n  - Definitions/typedefs for these integer types are required to understand object width/representation and whether any macros or type-promoting conversions in called functions could introduce unexpected behaviour relevant to loop counters or side effects (for completeness when inspecting implementations and any macros that may be type-dependent).\n\nNotes on scope: The list is focused on every function and macro invoked directly by UtAssert_Message, plus the direct callees of UT_BSP_DoText (per the provided static call graph). The MISRA rule requires consideration of the behaviour of called functions as part of a for-loop body; therefore implementations of all listed symbols must be inspected to determine whether any for loops they contain (or side effects they produce) would render a for loop that includes a call to UtAssert_Message ill-formed. If further transitive callees of those UT_BSP_* or OS_BSP_* functions exist, they should likewise be included when performing the full analysis."
