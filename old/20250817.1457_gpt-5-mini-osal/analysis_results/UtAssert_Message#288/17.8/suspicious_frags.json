  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. Analysis by parameter:\n- MessageType: passed and forwarded to UT_BSP_DoText; not assigned to or otherwise modified.\n- File (const char *): not assigned to or incremented. A local pointer (BaseName) is assigned from File and incremented (\"++BaseName\"), but that modifies the local variable, not the File parameter itself. The code does not write through File or pass it to a function that would modify the pointed-to object.\n- Line: used in a cast/format but not assigned to or modified.\n- Spec (const char *): used as the last named parameter in va_start and passed to vsnprintf as the format string; Spec itself is not assigned to or modified.\nOther operations (strrchr, snprintf, vsnprintf) either return or write into local variables/buffers (BaseName, FinalMessage) and do not modify the pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
