The earlier OS_CHECK_STRING(phys_path, sizeof(filesys->system_mountpt), ...) only guarantees phys_path is null-terminated within sizeof(system_mountpt) bytes, not that there are at least sizeof(filesys->volume_name) bytes available from dev_name to the end of phys_path. If sizeof(filesys->volume_name) is larger than the remaining bytes in phys_path starting at dev_name (for example phys_path is a 20-byte buffer with dev_name at offset 10 while sizeof(volume_name) == 64), memchr will read beyond the phys_path object -> violation of Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local;\n    struct stat                   stat_buf;\n\n    /* Probe log: function entry */\n    {\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/311.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl ENTRY: token=%p\\n\", (const void *)token);\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n    }\n\n    local = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token);\n\n    /* Probe log: resolved local object info */\n    {\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/311.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f)\n        {\n            if (local == NULL)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl: local == NULL (invalid token)\\n\");\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                const char *mp = local->system_mountpt ? local->system_mountpt : \"(NULL)\";\n                size_t mp_len = 0;\n                if (local->system_mountpt)\n                {\n                    /* Use strlen for observed length (note: original code also uses this string in stat/mkdir) */\n                    mp_len = strlen(local->system_mountpt);\n                }\n\n                fprintf(f, \"OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl: local=%p, system_mountpt=%p, system_mountpt_str=\\\"%s\\\", system_mountpt_len=%zu, fstype=%d\\n\",\n                        (void *)local, (void *)local->system_mountpt, mp, mp_len, (int)local->fstype);\n            }\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * This will do a mkdir() for the mount point if it does\n     * not already exist.\n     */\n    if (stat(local->system_mountpt, &stat_buf) != 0)\n    {\n        /* Probe: stat failed */\n        {\n            FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/311.txt\", \"a\");\n            if (f)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"stat(%s) != 0 -> errno=%d (%s)\\n\",\n                        local->system_mountpt ? local->system_mountpt : \"(NULL)\", errno, strerror(errno));\n                fclose(f);\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (mkdir(local->system_mountpt, 0700) < 0)\n        {\n            /* Probe: mkdir failed */\n            {\n                FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/311.txt\", \"a\");\n                if (f)\n                {\n                    fprintf(f, \"mkdir(%s) < 0 -> errno=%d (%s)\\n\",\n                            local->system_mountpt ? local->system_mountpt : \"(NULL)\", errno, strerror(errno));\n                    fclose(f);\n                }\n            }\n\n            OS_DEBUG(\"ERROR: Cannot create mount point %s: %s\", local->system_mountpt, strerror(errno));\n            /* Probe: returning error OS_FS_ERR_DRIVE_NOT_CREATED */\n            {\n                FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/311.txt\", \"a\");\n                if (f)\n                {\n                    fprintf(f, \"RETURN: OS_FS_ERR_DRIVE_NOT_CREATED\\n\");\n                    fclose(f);\n                }\n            }\n            return OS_FS_ERR_DRIVE_NOT_CREATED;\n        }\n    }\n    else if (!S_ISDIR(stat_buf.st_mode))\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"ERROR: Volume %s exists and is not a directory\", local->system_mountpt);\n        /* Probe: not a directory */\n        {\n            FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/311.txt\", \"a\");\n            if (f)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"stat path exists but not a directory: path=%s, st_mode=0%o\\n\",\n                        local->system_mountpt ? local->system_mountpt : \"(NULL)\", (unsigned int)stat_buf.st_mode);\n                fprintf(f, \"RETURN: OS_FS_ERR_DRIVE_NOT_CREATED\\n\");\n                fclose(f);\n            }\n        }\n        return OS_FS_ERR_DRIVE_NOT_CREATED;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * NOTE: The mount() system call could be used here to actually\n     * mount a disk, if warranted.

  "explanation": "The reported violation is not correct for the supplied OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl code. The agent's scenario describes a memchr(...) call scanning sizeof(filesys->volume_name) bytes from dev_name and a possible out\u2011of\u2011bounds read; however, the provided function contains no calls to memchr, memcpy, strncpy, strcat, strlen (except in the instrumentation version where strlen is only used for logging) or any other <string.h> routine that could cause the described out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. Also the scenario refers to identifiers (phys_path, dev_name, filesys->volume_name) that do not appear in the target function, so the claim appears to target a different piece of code. Therefore the report does not apply to the shown implementation."
