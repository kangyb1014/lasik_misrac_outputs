  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call uses strncmp(local->device_name, OS_POSIX_DEVICEFILE_PREFIX, sizeof(OS_POSIX_DEVICEFILE_PREFIX) - 1) where the third argument is the length of the prefix. If sizeof(local->device_name) is smaller than sizeof(OS_POSIX_DEVICEFILE_PREFIX) - 1, or if local->device_name is not guaranteed to contain a NUL within that many bytes, strncmp will attempt to read up to that many bytes from local->device_name and may access beyond the array bounds. Example: if OS_POSIX_DEVICEFILE_PREFIX is \"/dev/\" (sizeof(...) - 1 == 4) but OS_FS_DEV_NAME_LEN (the size of device_name) is 3, strncmp will read 4 bytes from device_name causing an out-of-bounds access and thus violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/311.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local;\n    struct stat                   stat_buf;\n\n    local = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n     * This will do a mkdir() for the mount point if it does\n     * not already exist.\n     */\n    if (stat(local->system_mountpt, &stat_buf) != 0)\n    {\n        if (mkdir(local->system_mountpt, 0700) < 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"ERROR: Cannot create mount point %s: %s\", local->system_mountpt, strerror(errno));\n            return OS_FS_ERR_DRIVE_NOT_CREATED;\n        }\n    }\n    else if (!S_ISDIR(stat_buf.st_mode))\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"ERROR: Volume %s exists and is not a directory\", local->system_mountpt);\n        return OS_FS_ERR_DRIVE_NOT_CREATED;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * NOTE: The mount() system call could be used here to actually\n     * mount a disk, if warranted.
