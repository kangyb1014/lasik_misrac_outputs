  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could be made to point to const-qualified types. The fragments not listed were examined and found not to require investigation under this rule: the function parameter token is already declared as a pointer to const; the string/path members (device_name, volume_name, system_mountpt, virtual_mountpt) are arrays, not pointer types (so the rule does not apply to them directly); OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already takes a pointer-to-const token; calls to stat(), mkdir(), and strerror() are API usages where the callee signatures determine constness; and the OS_DEBUG macro is a no-op here. The listed fragments are the places where non-const pointer types or non-const access to the filesystem table occur and therefore should be investigated to determine whether they can/should be const-qualified."
