  "explanation": "I examined the function and the related definitions for constructs that are known compiler language extensions (for example: GNU statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__ annotations, nested functions, computed goto/labels-as-values, inline asm (__asm__), zero-length arrays as an extension, use of __extension__, nonstandard calling conventions, or other compiler-specific builtins). None of these appear in the provided code. The variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) is a standard C99 feature (not a compiler extension) and its empty replacement is valid in C99/C11. The use of POSIX APIs (stat, mkdir, strerror, errno, S_ISDIR) are OS-level APIs, not C language extensions. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to a normal array/index expression and does not rely on any compiler-specific behavior. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that use compiler language extensions that would need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
