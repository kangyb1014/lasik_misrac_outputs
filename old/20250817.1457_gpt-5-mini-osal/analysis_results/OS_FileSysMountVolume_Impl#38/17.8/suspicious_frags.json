  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not modify the function parameter. There are no assignments to the parameter variable 'token' anywhere else in the function, nor any pointer arithmetic or increments on it. All subsequent uses operate on the local variable 'local' or on members of the object pointed to by 'local' (e.g. local->system_mountpt, local->fstype), or call library functions (stat, mkdir, strerror) that do not alter the parameter. The only potential concern is the function parameter declaration and the macro invocation: the declaration shows a pointer parameter and the macro call dereferences it (*token). The dereference as used in the code reads the token value; however the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET could, depending on its definition, modify its argument or cast away const. Therefore the signature and the macro call should be examined. All other code does not modify the function parameter and thus does not require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8."
