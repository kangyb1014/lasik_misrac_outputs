  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The macro takes the address of the token expression and passes it to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken which accepts a const OS_object_token_t *; the conversion from non-const to const is allowed. The pointer produced by the macro (&tbl[index]) is a pointer to the mutable table element intentionally (the table is declared non-const and may be modified elsewhere), so qualifying it const would not be appropriate here. (A violation would only exist if the table elements are never modified and could/should be declared const but are not.)"
