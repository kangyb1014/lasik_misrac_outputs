  "explanation": "The function parameter token is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *), and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const pointer, so those uses of pointers already satisfy Rule 8.13 and do not need investigation. Local scalar variables (Mode, how, return_code) are not pointers and are irrelevant to this rule. The call to shutdown() takes a plain int (conn_impl->fd) and does not imply writing through a pointer. The remaining code fragments either do not declare pointers or already use const-qualified pointer parameters, so they do not need further review for Rule 8.13. The listed suspicious fragments are places where a pointer to a (non-const) object is obtained/declared and could be changed to point to const-qualified types to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, so they should be investigated."
