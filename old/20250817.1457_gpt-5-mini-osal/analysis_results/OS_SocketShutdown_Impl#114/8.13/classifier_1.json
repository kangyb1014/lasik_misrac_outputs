  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: the fragment declares an array of OS_impl_file_internal_record_t, not a pointer. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 applies to pointers (they should point to const-qualified types when possible). This declaration is an object/array, so the rule does not apply. If the intent were read-only access, a const-qualified array or const pointer could be considered, but as written there is no Rule 8.13 violation."
