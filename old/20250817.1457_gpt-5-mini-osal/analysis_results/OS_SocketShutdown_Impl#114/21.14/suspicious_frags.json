  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other string-comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) is present in the provided code. The function OS_SocketShutdown_Impl performs only enum/int comparisons on Mode and an integer-based lookup via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, and it calls shutdown on a file descriptor. The related definitions show integer fields and enums; OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accesses token->obj_idx (no string operations). Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that compare null-terminated strings with memcmp and nothing needs to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 in this snippet."
