The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have listed fragments that may hide dead or incorrectly executed behavior and therefore warrant investigation: the Mode->how mapping (including the default else), the shutdown() call / return mapping, the enum entry OS_SocketShutdownMode_NONE (documented as \"no effect\"), the caller-side BUGCHECK that constrains Mode, the internal record member 'selectable', and the table lookup of conn_impl. These are reported because (a) the NONE enum value suggests a no-op but the Impl function's default branch would perform a full shutdown if NONE reached, (b) the default else branch might never be reachable or might have unintended effects depending on call sites, and (c) the shutdown return handling and use of the internal record fields are observable operations that could be misused.\n\nWhy other code fragments do NOT need investigation for dead code:\n- Variable declarations (return_code, how, conn_impl) are used later and are not dead. The return_code variable is assigned before use and returned; how is computed then used in shutdown; conn_impl is used to obtain fd for shutdown. Removing them would change behavior.\n- The call to OS_ObjectIdGetById, the stream-type/state checks, the updates to stream->stream_state, and OS_ObjectIdRelease are observable state changes (they affect object lookup results and stream state) and therefore not dead code.\n- The inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken and OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro are used to compute table indices; they are required for correct table access and are not dead.\n- The BUGCHECK invocation itself is an explicit validation (even if implemented as a macro) and is not dead: it enforces preconditions and can affect program behavior (e.g., by aborting on invalid args).\n- The use of bitwise checks (Mode & OS_SocketShutdownMode_SHUT_READ / SHUT_WRITE) to clear stream state in the caller is an observable change of the stream state and therefore not dead.\n\nInvestigate the listed fragments to determine whether any branch is truly dead given the project's call graph and whether the NONE enum value is correctly handled consistently across call sites."
