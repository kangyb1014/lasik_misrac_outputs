  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasons:\n- The function parameters are 'const OS_object_token_t *token' and 'OS_SocketShutdownMode_t Mode'. Neither parameter is assigned to or modified anywhere in the function: Mode is only compared (not assigned) and token is only dereferenced/used to obtain the table index.\n- The macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token) expands to use the address of the token value (&(*token)), which effectively yields the original token pointer; this does not modify the parameter itself.\n- The helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken takes a const pointer and only reads token->obj_idx (no modification).\n- conn_impl is a local variable that receives a pointer into OS_impl_filehandle_table; assigning to conn_impl does not modify the function parameters.\n- The const qualifier on the token parameter prevents modifying the pointed-to object via that pointer within this function.\nGiven the above, there are no assignments or operations that modify the value of either function parameter or the pointer itself, so no fragments violate Rule 17.8."
