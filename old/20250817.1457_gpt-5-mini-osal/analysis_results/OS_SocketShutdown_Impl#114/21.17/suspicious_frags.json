  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions are present in the provided code or related snippets. The function body only: - computes an index via OS_ObjectIndexFromToken (which just returns token->obj_idx), - uses OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET which expands to an array address expression (&tbl[index]), - calls shutdown(), and - assigns/returns integer constants. None of these are calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or any other <string.h> routine covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate Rule 21.17 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation under that rule."
