  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specific notes: \n\n- The use of `static inline` (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) is a standard C99 feature (not a compiler extension).\n- The `bool` member in the struct is a standard C99 boolean type (typically via stdbool.h) or can be a user typedef; in either case it is not a compiler language extension in the shown code.\n- The typedefs (`int32` from `int32_t`, the various struct/enum typedefs) and the enum constants are standard C constructs, not extensions.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and its use are preprocessor constructs (standard C), not language extensions.\n- Use of POSIX macros/constants (SHUT_RD/SHUT_WR/SHUT_RDWR) and the `shutdown()` call are OS/POSIX API usage, not compiler language extensions; MISRA Rule 1.2 pertains to language/compiler extensions, not platform APIs.\n\nBecause all constructs in the target function and the related definitions are standard C (C99/C11-era constructs) or ordinary preprocessor/OS API usage, there are no fragments that explicitly rely on documented compiler language extensions that would need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
