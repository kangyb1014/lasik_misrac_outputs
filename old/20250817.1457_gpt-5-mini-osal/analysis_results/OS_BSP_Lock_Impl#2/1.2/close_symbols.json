  "explanation": "For checking MISRA Rule \u201cLanguage extensions should not be used\u201d you must inspect not only the target function body but also the referenced macros, types and declarations to ensure none use compiler-specific extensions (attributes, statement-expressions, inline asm, GCC-only variadic macro forms, typeof, __extension__, etc.). Explanation for each symbol:\n\n- BSP_DEBUG (macro or function definition): BSP_DEBUG is invoked in the function; it may be a macro that expands to compiler extensions (e.g. GCC statement-expression ({ ... }), __attribute__, inline asm, or nonstandard variadic constructs). Its definition is required to confirm it uses only standard C constructs.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (variable and its structure/type definition): The global\u2019s declaration/definition may use nonstandard attributes, anonymous structs/unions, or other extensions. You must inspect the full type/definition to ensure it is standard C.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex (field declaration / type): This field\u2019s type (likely pthread_mutex_t or a wrapper) must be checked for any implementation-specific typedefs or attributes that are language extensions.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState (field declaration / type): The type used to hold cancel state (commonly int) should be checked for nonstandard typedefs or attributes.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock (prototype/declaration from pthread.h): The pthread API declarations in headers may include compiler-specific annotations or attributes (e.g. __nonnull, __attribute__((...))). The prototype must be inspected to ensure no extensions are introduced into the translation unit via these declarations.\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate (prototype/declaration from pthread.h): Same reason as above \u2014 its declaration could use attributes or other extensions.\n\n- PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE (macro/enum value): This macro/constant may be defined in headers; its definition should be checked for unusual constructs or if it is implemented via compiler-specific enum/attribute tricks.\n\n- strerror (prototype/declaration from string.h): Standard library headers sometimes include implementation extensions; check the declaration for attributes or nonstandard macros.\n\n- Headers that define BSP_DEBUG and OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (the BSP/board-support header(s) included by this TU): Rather than only checking individual symbols, you must inspect the header files that introduce BSP symbols to find any compiler-specific extensions used anywhere in those headers that affect the translation unit.\n\n- Translation-unit-level macro/attribute definitions (any #define, __attribute__, or compiler-specific macros used in this source or its included headers): MISRA's rule concerns language extensions introduced anywhere in the translation unit. Any file\u2011scope macros or attributes (e.g. __extension__, __attribute__, inline assembler, statement-expression macros) must be discovered; listing them lets the next analyzer check for such extensions.\n\nCollecting these definitions lets the analyzer determine if the source or any included headers introduce compiler-specific language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
