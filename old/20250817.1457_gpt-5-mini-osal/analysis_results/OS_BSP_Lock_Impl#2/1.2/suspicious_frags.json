  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. I inspected the fragment for common compiler-specific extensions that are explicitly documented as extensions (for example: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __attribute__((...)), __asm__/asm statements, inline assembly, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ...; }) with GNU ({ }), typeof/__typeof__, __extension__, labels as values (&&label), builtins that are extensions, vector extensions, or other compiler-specific keywords). None of these appear. The code only calls standard POSIX/C library functions (pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_setcancelstate, strerror, write is mentioned in the comment) and uses standard C syntax (variable declaration, function definition, if/else, comments). POSIX APIs are platform/library interfaces, not compiler language extensions, so they do not trigger Rule 1.2. Therefore there are no code fragments requiring investigation for use of language extensions."
