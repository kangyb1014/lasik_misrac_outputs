  "scenario": "No violation. pthread_mutex_lock has prototype int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *); it modifies the mutex, so the pointer must not point to a const-qualified type. Passing &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex is appropriate. A violation would occur if a pointer to data that is not modified by the callee were not const-qualified, but that is not the case here."
