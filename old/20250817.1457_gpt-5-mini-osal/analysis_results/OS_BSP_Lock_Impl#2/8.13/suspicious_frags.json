  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not involve taking addresses of objects that might be better declared as const-qualified pointers. The local variable declaration (int status;) and the control-flow (if/else) contain no pointer declarations or pointer targets to be const-qualified. The call to strerror(status) is not included because the standard library API declares strerror returning a non-const char *, so the call site cannot force a const qualification; it is therefore not a candidate for changing a pointed-to type to const in this code. No other pointer-bearing expressions occur in the provided function body that would be candidates for const-qualification without examining the declarations of the referenced structure fields (which are the two address-of occurrences listed)."
