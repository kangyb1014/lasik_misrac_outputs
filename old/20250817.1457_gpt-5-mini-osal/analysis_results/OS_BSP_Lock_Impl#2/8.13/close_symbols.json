  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible we must know the exact types and prototypes involved where addresses or pointers are used in OS_BSP_Lock_Impl:\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n  - Need the variable/struct definition so we can see the declared types of its fields (AccessMutex and AccessCancelState). The const-qualification of the objects themselves (or lack thereof) matters for whether taking their addresses violates the rule.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex (field type / declaration)\n  - Required to determine the exact type of AccessMutex (e.g. pthread_mutex_t) and whether it is declared const. This affects whether &AccessMutex yields a pointer-to-const or pointer-to-non-const and whether that is appropriate for the called function.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState (field type / declaration)\n  - Required to know the type (e.g. int, volatile int) and const-qualification of the cancel-state object. Passing its address to pthread_setcancelstate must match the expected non-const or const pointer type.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock (prototype)\n  - Must know the parameter type (usually pthread_mutex_t *) and whether it is const-qualified. If the prototype takes a non-const pointer, passing &AccessMutex is appropriate; if it took a const pointer, MISRA concerns could be different.\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate (prototype)\n  - Its second parameter is typically an int * (output). We need the exact signature to verify that a non-const pointer is required (and thus no violation when passing &AccessCancelState).\n\n- strerror (prototype)\n  - Returns a char * (POSIX) but logically points to static read-only text. Knowing its prototype shows whether it returns char * or const char *, which is central to evaluating whether the returned pointer should be const-qualified per MISRA.\n\n- BSP_DEBUG (macro or function prototype)\n  - Need the prototype or macro definition to determine the expected types of its parameters (e.g. const char *fmt, ...). This affects whether passing the result of strerror (char *) into a function expecting const char * triggers any const-qualification issue.\n\n- PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE (macro / constant)\n  - Its type (typically an int constant) is needed to confirm the type of the first argument to pthread_setcancelstate; not directly a pointer issue, but included for completeness of the call-site type-checking.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t (typedef / definition)\n  - If AccessMutex is pthread_mutex_t, the typedef/definition clarifies whether it is an object type that must be modified by pthread_mutex_lock (justifying non-const pointer parameter). It also helps determine whether the address expression should be a pointer-to-const in any circumstances.\n\nProviding these symbols (the struct/field declarations and the exact function/macro prototypes) gives the necessary type information to decide if any pointer in OS_BSP_Lock_Impl ought to be const-qualified under MISRA, or if the non-const usage is justified because the callee modifies the pointed-to object or the API requires a non-const pointer."
