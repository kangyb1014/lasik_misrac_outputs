  "explanation": "OS_BSP_Lock_Impl has no formal parameters, so there are no function parameters in this function that could be modified (MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 concerns modification of a function's parameters). The only pointer usages are arguments to library calls: pthread_mutex_lock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex) and pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState). These pass addresses of global objects (not function parameters). MISRA 17.8 allows the object referred to by a pointer parameter to be modified; it only forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself inside a function. The code in this function does not assign to any parameter nor to any pointer parameter variable. BSP_DEBUG is defined empty, so it introduces no hidden parameter modification. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
