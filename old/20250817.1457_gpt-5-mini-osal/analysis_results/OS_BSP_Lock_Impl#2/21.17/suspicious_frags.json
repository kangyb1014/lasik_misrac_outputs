  "explanation": "No calls to the string-handling functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided code. The only function related to strings is strerror(status) in OS_BSP_Lock_Impl; strerror does not accept a pointer to a caller-supplied object buffer (it returns a pointer to an internal static message), so Rule 21.17\u2019s prohibition against accessing beyond the bounds of objects via string.h pointer parameters does not apply. OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl uses the POSIX write() syscall (not a <string.h> function) and performs pointer arithmetic (Str += WriteLen; DataLen -= WriteLen) guarded by the loop and the checks on WriteLen, so there is no use of the listed <string.h> functions that could cause out-of-bounds accesses and no fragment requires further investigation under Rule 21.17."
