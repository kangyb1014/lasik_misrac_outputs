  "explanation": "No calls to memcmp are present in the provided code fragment. The function only calls pthread_mutex_lock, strerror (used to format an error string), BSP_DEBUG, and pthread_setcancelstate. None of these invoke or use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, and there are no manual byte-wise comparisons of strings in the code. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
