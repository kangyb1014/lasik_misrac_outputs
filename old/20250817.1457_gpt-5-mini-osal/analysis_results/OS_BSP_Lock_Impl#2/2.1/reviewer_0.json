  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. pthread_mutex_lock() per POSIX returns 0 on success or a positive error number on failure, so the condition (status < 0) can never be true; the BSP_DEBUG branch is therefore unreachable. The provided probe output shows only status=0 and the else branch being taken repeatedly, corroborating that the negative-status branch is never executed. Because MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 forbids unreachable code, this constitutes a violation. (Recommended corrective change: test for status != 0 or handle specific positive error codes rather than testing for status < 0.)"
