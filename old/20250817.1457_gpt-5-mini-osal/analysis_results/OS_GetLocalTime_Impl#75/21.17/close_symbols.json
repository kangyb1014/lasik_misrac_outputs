  "explanation": "For deciding whether this function violates the MISRA <string.h> rule you must inspect any string-handling usage paths and any functions/macros that could themselves use string.h routines. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- strerror: This is the explicit string-library call used in the error path (strerror(errno)). Verify its declaration/behavior and whether its use could produce or depend on out-of-bounds access (or whether it uses internal static buffers that are later copied/modified unsafely).\n\n- errno: The argument passed to strerror; inspect how errno is defined/used in this codebase and whether an invalid/large value could cause undefined behavior in the strerror implementation.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: The logging macro/function that consumes the strerror result. OS_DEBUG may format or copy strings using snprintf/strcpy/strcat/etc. You must inspect its implementation to ensure it does not call any <string.h> functions in a way that can access out-of-bounds memory when given the strerror() result or other inputs.\n\n- clock_gettime: The system call used to obtain time. Included because it controls the control flow: only on the error path is strerror/OS_DEBUG invoked. Verify its return semantics so the code paths that use string functions are correctly identified.\n\n- OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK: The clock identifier passed to clock_gettime; include to fully understand clock_gettime usage and any platform-specific behavior that may affect error handling (and therefore whether the string path is exercised).\n\n- struct timespec (tv_sec, tv_nsec): The target reads these fields and passes them to OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds; include the type definition to ensure no hidden string operations occur here and to confirm there are no buffer/aliasing issues that could interact with string functions.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS / OS_ERROR: Return-code macros/enum values to understand control flow and whether any other code (not shown) is invoked that might perform string operations when these codes are produced.\n\nNote: OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds is already in the static call graph; ensure its implementation is also inspected for any use of <string.h> routines. The symbols above are the additional items you need to inspect to determine whether any string.h functions are invoked or used unsafely along the code paths in OS_GetLocalTime_Impl."
