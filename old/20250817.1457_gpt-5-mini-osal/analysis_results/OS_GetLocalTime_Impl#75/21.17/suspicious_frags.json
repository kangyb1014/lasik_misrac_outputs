  "explanation": "All other lines in OS_GetLocalTime_Impl do not call any of the string handling functions from <string.h> listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) and therefore do not present the specific out-of-bounds pointer-parameter risks covered by this rule. Calls to clock_gettime, the assignment via OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds, the ReturnCode assignments, and the return statement do not perform string operations and so do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
