  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. strerror(errno) returns a pointer to an implementation-supplied, null-terminated error string and does not take pointer parameters that could cause accesses beyond referenced object bounds. Passing the returned pointer to a printing routine (as in OS_DEBUG) reads up to the terminator and does not itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Note: there are other concerns (the returned pointer may be to a static/thread-local buffer and is not safe to modify or rely on across further strerror calls), but these are not violations of Rule 21.17."
