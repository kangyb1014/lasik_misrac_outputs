  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were found in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No use of compiler-specific keywords or builtins (e.g. __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm__, asm, __extension__, typeof, __label__ or similar) is present.\n- The static inline function and structure assignment are standard C (C99/C11) features, not compiler extensions.\n- The variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) uses standard C99 variadic macro syntax, not a compiler-only extension; its empty definition is a legal macro replacement.\n- Typedefs such as int32/int64/uint32 are user-defined aliases (presumably to standard fixed-width types like int32_t/int64_t) and are not language extensions.\n- Use of POSIX APIs/types (clock_gettime, struct timespec, strerror, errno) are OS/API features, not compiler language extensions covered by MISRA Rule 1.2.\n- No GCC/Clang/MSC-specific constructs (statement-expressions, nested functions, zero-length arrays, pragmas outside standard scope, etc.) appear in the snippet.\nTherefore there are no fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
