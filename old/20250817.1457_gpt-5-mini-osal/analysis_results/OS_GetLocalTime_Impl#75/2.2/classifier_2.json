Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_GetLocalTime_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_GetLocalTime_Impl(OS_time_t *time_struct)\n{\n    int             Status;\n    int32           ReturnCode;\n    struct timespec TimeSp;\n\n    Status = clock_gettime(OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK, &TimeSp);\n\n    if (Status == 0)\n    {\n        *time_struct = OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds(TimeSp.tv_sec, TimeSp.tv_nsec);\n        ReturnCode   = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"Error calling clock_gettime: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n        ReturnCode = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return ReturnCode;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_GetLocalTime_Impl:\nconst OS_time_t *time_struct\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nconst OS_time_t *time_struct\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The fragment is a declaration of a pointer type (const OS_time_t *time_struct) and does not perform any runtime operation. Rule 2.2 defines dead code as executed operations whose removal would not affect behaviour. A mere declaration (or an unused object) is not an executed operation and therefore this fragment does not constitute dead code under Rule 2.2. (If the symbol were an unused definition, that might be addressed by other MISRA rules, but not by Rule 2.2.)"
