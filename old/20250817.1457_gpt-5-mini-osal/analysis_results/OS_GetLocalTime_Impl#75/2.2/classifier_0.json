  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_GetLocalTime_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_GetLocalTime_Impl(OS_time_t *time_struct)\n{\n    int             Status;\n    int32           ReturnCode;\n    struct timespec TimeSp;\n\n    Status = clock_gettime(OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK, &TimeSp);\n\n    if (Status == 0)\n    {\n        *time_struct = OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds(TimeSp.tv_sec, TimeSp.tv_nsec);\n        ReturnCode   = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"Error calling clock_gettime: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n        ReturnCode = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return ReturnCode;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_GetLocalTime_Impl:\nconst OS_time_t *time_struct\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n*time_struct = OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds(TimeSp.tv_sec, TimeSp.tv_nsec);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The statement writes the output parameter with the assembled time value; removing it would change program behaviour because callers expect the time_struct to be updated. Therefore the statement is not dead. (If time_struct were actually declared as pointing-to-const (const OS_time_t *), the code would not compile rather than become dead code.)"
