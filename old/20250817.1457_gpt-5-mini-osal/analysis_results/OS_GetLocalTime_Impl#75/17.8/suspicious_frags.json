  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the pointer parameter variable (time_struct) itself. The only write involving the parameter is the assignment to *time_struct (\"*time_struct = OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds(...);\"), which modifies the object pointed to \u2014 this is permitted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. There are no reassignments such as \"time_struct = ...\" nor is time_struct passed to another function in a way that would change the pointer value. Other uses (e.g., &TimeSp passed to clock_gettime, local variables) do not affect the pointer parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for Rule 17.8 compliance."
