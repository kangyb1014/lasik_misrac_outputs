  "explanation": "I report all places in this function where non-const-qualified pointers are present or pointer results are used: the function parameter (pointer to OS_time_t), the direct write through that pointer, the call passing &TimeSp to an external function, and the use of strerror() result passed to the logger. Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: Status, ReturnCode, and TimeSp are non-pointer local variables; TimeSp is passed by address to clock_gettime which necessarily writes into it (so a non-const pointer is required); assignments and integer returns involve non-pointer types; the call to OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds returns a value (not a pointer). Thus no other lines in this function exhibit pointers that could be const-qualified."
