  "explanation": "To decide whether any part of OS_GetLocalTime_Impl is statically unreachable you must know which calls/macros can never produce the alternative control flow used in the function. Each listed symbol can affect reachability as follows:\n\n- clock_gettime\n  - Determines the value assigned to Status. If clock_gettime is a macro or an implementation that is guaranteed to always return 0 (or guaranteed to never return non-zero), the 'else' branch would be unreachable. Conversely, if it cannot fail, the 'then' branch will always be taken. You need the declaration/definition (or macro replacement) to determine possible return values.\n\n- OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK\n  - This macro is passed to clock_gettime; its definition could cause clock_gettime to be resolved to a variant or a macro mapping that affects whether the call can fail (e.g., platform-specific wrappers). Its value may also change the call-site semantics via macros.\n\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds\n  - Called inside the 'then' branch. If this symbol is annotated/implemented as noreturn (or performs longjmp/exit), subsequent statements in the 'then' branch (e.g., ReturnCode = OS_SUCCESS) would be unreachable. Its prototype/attributes and implementation are required to judge reachability inside the 'then' branch.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR\n  - These constants are assigned to ReturnCode in the two branches. While they do not directly change control flow, their definitions may reveal macros or side-effecting constructs that could affect reachability analysis (for example, if one expands to a construct that does not allow continuation). At minimum include them to confirm they are ordinary constants.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - Used in the 'else' branch. If OS_DEBUG is a macro that expands to nothing or to an expression that suppresses the entire else block (e.g., by macro trickery), the apparent else branch could be compiled out and thus be unreachable. Its definition is needed to confirm the actual compiled control flow.\n\n- strerror\n  - Called in the debug message. If strerror is a macro or replaced by something that affects control flow (unlikely but possible in some environments), it could affect reachability of code in the else branch. Include its declaration/definition to be thorough.\n\n- errno\n  - errno may be a macro that expands to a function call or thread-local access; its expansion could theoretically produce side-effects or change semantics used in the else branch. Knowing how errno is defined helps determine whether the else branch contains executable code.\n\nProviding the definitions/prototypes/attributes of these symbols (or the headers/macros that define them) lets the next agent determine whether any branch or statement in OS_GetLocalTime_Impl is impossible to reach (and therefore a MISRA 'unreachable code' violation)."
