  "explanation": "No other code fragments appear to be unreachable. The call to clock_gettime and its if/else branches are normal control flow (the call may succeed or fail at runtime), and both branches assign ReturnCode before the function returns. The local variables (Status, TimeSp, ReturnCode) are used, and the inline helper OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds is invoked in the success path. The other macros and constants (OSAL_GETTIME_SOURCE_CLOCK, OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR) are simple definitions and do not introduce unreachable code. There is no code after the return statement, and no other obvious dead-code constructs in the provided snippets. Therefore only the debug invocation and its empty macro definition warrant investigation for potential removal/effect on reachability."
