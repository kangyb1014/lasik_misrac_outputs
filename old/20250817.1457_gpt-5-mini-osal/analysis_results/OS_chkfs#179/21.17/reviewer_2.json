While this guarantees mplen is <= sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) (and the filesys buffer is safe), there is no check that the 'target' string (the caller-supplied name) has at least mplen bytes accessible. If target is shorter than mplen (e.g. filesys->virtual_mountpt = \"/mnt/virtual\" with mplen = 12 and target = \"/mnt\" length 4), strncmp will attempt to read up to mplen bytes from target and can read beyond the bounds of the target object, violating Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_chkfs_log_open_context(const char *name)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1439.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"--- OS_chkfs ENTRY ---\\n\");\n    fprintf(f, \"name pointer: %p\\n\", (const void *)name);\n\n    /* Safe bounded length probe for the caller-supplied name (target) */\n    if (name == NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"name: NULL\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        size_t safe_len = strnlen(name, 1024U); /* bound to avoid long traversal */\n        fprintf(f, \"name_len (strnlen bound 1024) = %zu\\n\", safe_len);\n\n        /* Print a preview of the name up to a limited number of characters */\n        fprintf(f, \"name_preview: '\");\n        for (size_t i = 0U; i < safe_len && i < 256U; ++i)\n        {\n            int c = (unsigned char)name[i];\n            /* print as-is; non-printables still get written as bytes */\n            fputc(c, f);\n        }\n        if (safe_len > 256U)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"...\");\n        }\n        fprintf(f, \"'\\n\");\n    }\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\nstatic void OS_chkfs_log_event(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    va_list ap;\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1439.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_chkfs(const char *name, bool repair)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n    int32             return_code;\n\n    /* Probe: log entry and caller-supplied name details */\n    OS_chkfs_log_open_context(name);\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_PATHNAME(name);\n\n    OS_chkfs_log_event(\"Calling OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch with name=%p\", (const void *)name);\n\n    /* Get a reference lock, as a filesystem check could take some time. */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(OS_LOCK_MODE_REFCOUNT, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint,\n                                         (void *)name, &token);\n\n    OS_chkfs_log_event(\"OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch returned %ld\", (long)return_code);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Log that token was acquired.

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct in principle. The OS_chkfs code passes the caller-supplied pointer name into OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch with OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint as the search comparator. If that comparator implements something like strncmp(target, filesys->virtual_mountpt, mplen) where mplen is derived solely from the length of filesys->virtual_mountpt (e.g. mplen = OS_strnlen(filesys->virtual_mountpt, sizeof(...))), there is a real possibility that strncmp will attempt to read up to mplen bytes from target even when target is shorter. strncmp can read up to n bytes from each operand, so using an n computed only from the filesystem buffer without first bounding/checking the caller-supplied buffer can read beyond the target object and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The empty test log or inability to reproduce at runtime does not negate the static possibility of out-of-bounds access. To remediate, ensure the compare uses a length bounded by the minimum of the two operand lengths (e.g. compute target_len = strnlen(target, mplen) and use target_len) or otherwise guarantee the target object has at least mplen bytes accessible before calling strncmp."
