  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_SymbolLookup_Impl can lead to out-of-bounds accesses by standard <string.h> functions, the analyzer must inspect all called code and related types/values that handle the SymbolName and symbol-address outputs and that control the iteration. For each symbol: \n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee that receives SymbolName and SymbolAddress; must be inspected for any use of memcpy/strncpy/strcmp/strlen/etc. and how it validates lengths and buffer bounds.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: Direct callee invoked per-module with the same SymbolName and SymbolAddress; it may perform string operations itself or call OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, so its implementation is required.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext: Used as the loop condition and may update the iterator token passed to OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl. Its behavior can affect which module/token is looked up and whether any string buffers or pointers in the iterator are involved in subsequent calls.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive: Initializes the iterator passed into the loop; its implementation (and anything it calls) may allocate or initialize buffers or internal strings that could be used later and must be checked for string usage and bounds handling.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit: Called by OS_ObjectIdIterateActive (per call graph); include to inspect any lower-level initialization that may touch string/buffer handling inside the iterator implementation.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy: Cleanup function called after the loop; it may call other functions that manipulate internal iterator buffers or state (and thus may use string functions) and is part of the iterator lifecycle that should be examined.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel: Callee of OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy per call graph; include to ensure no string operations in cancel/cleanup can cause out-of-bounds issues tied to iterator state.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: Called by OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl; needed to understand how the token (from the iterator) is translated to an index or object and whether that translation involves string operations or buffer accesses that could be out-of-bounds.\n\n- OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE: Global/constant passed into OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl that can change lookup code path (e.g., global vs. per-module). Behavior depending on this handle may select different code paths that use string functions, so its value/meaning is relevant.\n\n- cpuaddr (typedef): The type/size of the SymbolAddress output determines how memory copies or address computations are performed; needed to reason about any memcpy/memmove usage and alignment/size issues.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS (macro/enum): The status compare controls whether the module-iteration branch runs. Knowing its value/meaning is needed to reason about control flow and whether potentially unsafe string operations in callees are executed.\n\n- OS_object_iter_t (type/struct): The iterator structure (including the token member) must be inspected to see if it contains embedded character buffers, pointer fields, or size fields that participate in string operations performed by iterator functions or by OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl.\n\nCollectively, these symbols (functions, types, and constants) provide the call/flow context and the actual implementations that may invoke <string.h> functions or manipulate buffers derived from SymbolName/SymbolAddress. Without them one cannot determine whether any uses of memcpy/strncpy/strcat/strlen/etc. in the call chain could access memory beyond the referenced objects."
