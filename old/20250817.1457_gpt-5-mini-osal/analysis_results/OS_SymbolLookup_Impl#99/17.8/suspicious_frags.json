  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided functions and found no instances where a function parameter (the pointer variable itself) is assigned to or otherwise modified. The only modifications performed are to the objects pointed to by pointer parameters (for example, assignments to *SymbolAddress in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl), which is permitted by MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. There are no statements such as SymbolAddress = ..., SymbolName = ..., dl_handle = ..., token = ..., or pointer arithmetic/inc/dec on any parameter pointer in the shown code. Calls that take pointer arguments (for example OS_ObjectIdIterateActive, OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext, OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy) receive addresses of local variables, not parameter pointers. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that violate Rule 17.8 and no further fragments need investigation."
