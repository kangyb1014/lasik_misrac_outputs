  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_SymbolLookup_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 8.13.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_SymbolLookup_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32            status;\n    int32            local_status;\n    OS_object_iter_t iter;\n\n    /* First search global table */\n    status = OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /* If not found iterate through module local symbols and break if found */\n    if (status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE, &iter);\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            local_status = OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(&iter.token, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n            if (local_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n            {\n                status = local_status;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:If OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl is declared to take a non-const pointer for the symbol name (e.g. int32 OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(..., cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, char *SymbolName)) or a non-const pointer to the token when it need not modify the token, then this call passes a const-qualified pointer (const char *SymbolName) to a parameter that is not const \u2014 discarding const qualification. That would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl already declares its parameters as const where appropriate, no violation occurs.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_SymbolLookup_Log(const char *stage, const void *token_ptr, const cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName, int32 status)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/795.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        time_t t = time(NULL);\n        /* Log timestamp, stage, token pointer (address of iterator token), symbol address pointer, symbol name, and status */\n        fprintf(f, \"[%ld] %s: token_ptr=%\" PRIuPTR \" SymbolAddress=%\" PRIuPTR \" SymbolName=\\\"%s\\\" status=%d\\n\",\n                (long)t,\n                stage,\n                (uintptr_t)token_ptr,\n                (uintptr_t)SymbolAddress,\n                (SymbolName != NULL) ?

  "explanation": "The reported violation is not supported by the code shown. OS_SymbolLookup_Impl declares its input as const char *SymbolName, which conforms with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (use const for pointer-to-input-strings where possible). The only way the call would \u201cdiscard\u201d const qualification is if the callee OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl were declared to accept a non-const char * (or a non-const token pointer). That would be a problem in the callee\u2019s declaration (and the call would discard qualifiers), not in OS_SymbolLookup_Impl itself. Because no callee prototype was provided, you cannot conclude that OS_SymbolLookup_Impl violates Rule 8.13. Therefore the report as applied to this function is not correct."
