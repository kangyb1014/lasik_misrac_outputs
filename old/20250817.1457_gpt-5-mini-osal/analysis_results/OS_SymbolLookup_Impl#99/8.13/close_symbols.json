  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_SymbolLookup_Impl violates the MISRA rule about using const-qualified pointer types whenever possible we must know the exact signatures and types involved so we can tell which pointer parameters are inputs (should be const) versus outputs/modified (must be non-const). Specifically:\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl (prototype/signature): needed to see the const-qualification of the SymbolName parameter and of the SymbolAddress parameter (is the symbol name accepted as const char * or as char *; is the address an output?). If GenericSymbolLookup takes a non-const pointer for an input-only argument, that would indicate a potential MISRA violation upstream or constrain changes here.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl (prototype/signature): same reason as above for the module-local lookup call \u2014 check const qualifiers for the SymbolName and SymbolAddress parameters and for the token parameter passed by address.\n\n- cpuaddr (typedef/definition): to determine whether cpuaddr is a scalar type, a pointer type, or a typedef to a pointer. If cpuaddr were itself a pointer type then cpuaddr * would be a pointer-to-pointer and const qualification rules differ; knowing the exact type is required to assess const correctness of SymbolAddress.\n\n- OS_object_iter_t (typedef/definition): the iterator variable 'iter' is passed to iterator functions and its token member is passed to ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl; we need the definition to see which members are pointers and whether they are intended input-only or modified.\n\n- type of OS_object_iter_t.token (token member type): the code passes &iter.token to OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl. We must know the token member's type to check whether it should be passed as const (i.e., if the callee only reads it) or as non-const (if it is modified). The token's type determination is essential for correct const qualification.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive (prototype/signature): the function is called with &iter; we need its signature to see whether it takes the iterator pointer as const or non-const (i.e., whether it modifies the iterator). If it does not modify the iterator, the parameter ought to be const per MISRA.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext (prototype/signature): called in the loop condition; its signature shows whether it takes a const iterator pointer or modifies iterator state. That affects whether iter should be const-qualified and whether passing &iter to other functions could be const.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy (prototype/signature): called to clean up the iterator; its signature indicates whether it modifies the iterator and whether the iterator type or its members should be non-const.\n\nThese symbols together provide the necessary declarations and type information to decide which pointer parameters in OS_SymbolLookup_Impl (and the objects it passes through) are input-only and therefore should be const-qualified under MISRA, and which are legitimately modified and must remain non-const."
