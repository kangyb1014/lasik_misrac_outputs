  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: SymbolName is already declared as const char * (const-qualified). The iterator variable 'iter' and the calls OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(..., &iter), OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter) and OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter) are omitted because these iterator APIs are expected to modify the iterator state and therefore must accept a non-const pointer; they do not indicate a missing const qualification. The scalar variables (status, local_status) and control-flow lines (while loop, break, return) are not pointer declarations and are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
