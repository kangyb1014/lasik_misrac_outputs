  "explanation": "All other code fragments in the function are either scalar declarations/uses (return_code, task_id, new_priority), value-return or return statements, or comments. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types and whether they could be qualified as pointing to const; non-pointer objects and value-passed parameters are not relevant to this rule. The listed fragments are the only places in the function that introduce or pass addresses/pointers and therefore are the ones that need investigation for possible const-qualification. No other lines in the provided function contain pointer variables or pointer arguments that would be subject to Rule 8.13, so they do not require further examination for this rule."
