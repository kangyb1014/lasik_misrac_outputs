  "scenario": "The code stores new_priority into task->priority, i.e. it intentionally modifies the object pointed to by task. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever they are not used to modify the pointed-to object. In this case the pointed-to object is being modified, so the pointer must not be const. Therefore no violation: the pointer correctly points to a non-const type. A violation would occur if the function did not modify *task but the pointer was declared non-const (it could have been declared const)."
