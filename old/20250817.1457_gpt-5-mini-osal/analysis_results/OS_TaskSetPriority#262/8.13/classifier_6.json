  "scenario": "The declaration 'OS_object_token_t token;' is an object (a token struct) rather than a pointer. The code then passes '&token' to functions (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdRelease), indicating the functions expect a pointer to the token object. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations needing const-qualified pointee types when possible; since this declaration is not a pointer type, the rule does not apply. (If OS_object_token_t were typedef'd as a pointer type, that would be a different situation, but the usage here shows it is not.)"
