  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. There are no assignments to any parameter (no statements like address = ..., devname = ..., or volname = ...), no increments/decrements, and none of the parameters\u2019 addresses are passed to another function (e.g. &address) that could allow modification of the pointer variable itself. The call OS_FileSys_Initialize(address, devname, volname, ...) passes the pointer values by value \u2014 that may allow the callee to modify the objects pointed to (which is permitted), but it cannot change the pointer variables of OS_mkfs. Additionally, devname and volname are const char * (so their pointees should not be modified), and return_code is a local variable. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
