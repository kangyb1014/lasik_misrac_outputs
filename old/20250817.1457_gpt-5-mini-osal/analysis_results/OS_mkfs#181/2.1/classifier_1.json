  "scenario": "No violation. The assignment statement is executed unconditionally during normal execution, so the subsequent if and return statements are reachable. This fragment does not itself introduce unreachable code. (Note: a violation would occur only if OS_FileSys_Initialize were specified as non-returning \u2014 e.g. annotated noreturn or guaranteed to exit/loop/longjmp \u2014 in which case the following if/return would be unreachable.)"
