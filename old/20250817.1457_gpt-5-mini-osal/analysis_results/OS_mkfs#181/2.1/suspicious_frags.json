  "explanation": "The remaining fragments (function signature and local variable declaration) are simple declarations and do not themselves create unreachable code. The suspicious fragments selected cover: the call to OS_FileSys_Initialize (which could be non-returning or provably never produce certain values), the conditional that maps legacy error codes (which could be statically impossible or redundant), the assignment inside that conditional, and the final return (which would be unreachable if the initializer never returns). These are the points that need investigation to determine whether any part of the function is provably unreachable. No other executable statements exist in the function, so no additional fragments require investigation."
