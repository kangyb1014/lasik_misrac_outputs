  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the if-condition (checking return_code against OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE or OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS) is potentially reachable at runtime and does not itself introduce unreachable code. A specific violation scenario would be if the compiler can prove the condition is always false (for example, if OS_FileSys_Initialize is a macro/inline that is known at compile time to always return a value that can never equal OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE or OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS); in that case the if-body would be provably unreachable and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
