  "explanation": "I inspected the entire function for use of compiler-specific language extensions (for example GCC/Clang __attribute__/__builtin__/__typeof__, inline asm, nested functions, statement-expressions ({ ... }), transparent unions, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, or other documented compiler extensions). None of those constructs appear in this code fragment. The identifiers int32 and osal_blockcount_t are custom typedef names (not language extensions) and may be project-defined types; their use is a normal typedef usage rather than a compiler extension. size_t and string pointer types are standard C. The boolean token true is the standard boolean macro from <stdbool.h> (its presence here is not a language extension). The conditional, return, and comment constructs are all standard C. Therefore there are no explicit compiler language extensions in this snippet to flag for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
