  "scenario": "The parameter 'address' is declared as char * but is never modified in OS_mkfs (it is only passed to OS_FileSys_Initialize). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 this pointer should be const-qualified (const char *address) unless the callee actually modifies the pointed-to data. devname and volname are already const-qualified. If OS_FileSys_Initialize does not require a mutable pointer, the current prototype violates Rule 8.13 (or else a justification is required if the non-const is intentional)."
