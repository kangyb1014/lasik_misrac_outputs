  "explanation": "The only non-const pointer in this function is the parameter 'address' in the function signature; that should be investigated to determine whether it could be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type. The call to OS_FileSys_Initialize passes 'address' onward and therefore is relevant to check whether the pointed-to data is modified by the callee. No other pointer objects appear in this function: devname and volname are already const-qualified, and there are no other pointer variables or pointer-returning expressions here, so no additional fragments need investigation."
