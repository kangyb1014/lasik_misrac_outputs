  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe parameter 'address' is declared as char * but is never modified in OS_mkfs (it is only passed to OS_FileSys_Initialize). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 this pointer should be const-qualified (const char *address) unless the callee actually modifies the pointed-to data. devname and volname are already const-qualified. If OS_FileSys_Initialize does not require a mutable pointer, the current prototype violates Rule 8.13 (or else a justification is required if the non-const is intentional).\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_mkfs code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1451.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_mkfs as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_mkfs:\n```c\nint32 OS_mkfs(char *address, const char *devname, const char *volname, size_t blocksize, osal_blockcount_t numblocks)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_FileSys_Initialize(address, devname, volname, blocksize, numblocks, true);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE || return_code == OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS)\n    {\n        /*\n         * This is the historic filesystem-specific error code generated when\n         * attempting to mkfs()/initfs() on a filesystem that was\n         * already initialized, or if there were no free slots in the table.\n         *\n         * This code preserved just in case application code was checking for it.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_FS_ERR_DEVICE_NOT_FREE;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_mkfs code.\n",
