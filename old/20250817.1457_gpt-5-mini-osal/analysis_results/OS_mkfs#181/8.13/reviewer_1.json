According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 this pointer should be const-qualified (const char *address) unless the callee actually modifies the pointed-to data. devname and volname are already const-qualified.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the OS_mkfs implementation the pointer parameter address is not modified (it is only forwarded to OS_FileSys_Initialize) while devname and volname are already const-qualified. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointer parameters to point to const-qualified types whenever possible. Given the observed behavior (the probe shows address is never written to or altered), the address parameter should be declared const char *address unless there is a specific, documented reason why a non-const is required (for example if OS_FileSys_Initialize requires a mutable pointer). As presented, and under the provided exhaustive test results showing no modification, the current prototype violates Rule 8.13."
