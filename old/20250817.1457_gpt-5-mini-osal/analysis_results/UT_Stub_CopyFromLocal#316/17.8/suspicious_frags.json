  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- FuncKey is only passed to UT_GetStubEntry and never assigned to or altered.\n- LocalBuffer (declared const void *) is only used as the source argument to memcpy; the pointer itself is not reassigned and the object it points to is not modified by this function.\n- MaxSize is read and compared but never assigned to or altered.\nOther statements modify members of the structure pointed to by StubPtr (e.g., Position and the buffer contents) or call helper functions, but these do not violate Rule 17.8 because they do not modify the parameter objects themselves or reassign pointer parameters. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in this code."
