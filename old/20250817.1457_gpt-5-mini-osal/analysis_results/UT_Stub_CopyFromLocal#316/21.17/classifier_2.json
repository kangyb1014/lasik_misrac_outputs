  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the presented code path: ActualCopy is computed as StubPtr->Data.Buff.TotalSize - StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position and then clamped to MaxSize, so the subsequent memcpy cannot copy more bytes than remain in the buffer. Incrementing Position by ActualCopy therefore does not by itself cause an out-of-bounds access, and the entry is cleared when Position >= TotalSize. Potential violation scenario: if the buffer invariants are already violated (e.g. StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position > StubPtr->Data.Buff.TotalSize), the subtraction would underflow (size_t wrap), producing a very large ActualCopy and causing memcpy to access beyond the buffer bounds\u2014this would violate Rule 21.17."
