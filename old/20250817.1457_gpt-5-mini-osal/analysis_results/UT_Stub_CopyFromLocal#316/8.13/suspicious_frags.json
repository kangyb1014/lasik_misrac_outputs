  "explanation": "No suspicious pointer usages found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 in this function. Rationale:\n\n- The function parameter LocalBuffer is declared as const void * (already const-qualified), satisfying the rule for input data that is not modified.\n- The only pointer local variable, StubPtr, is used to modify the referenced structure (e.g., StubPtr->Data.Buff.Position is incremented and UT_ClearStubEntry(StubPtr) is called). Because the pointee is intentionally modified, StubPtr must not be const-qualified.\n- The destination passed to memcpy (&StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr[...]) must be a non-const pointer because memcpy writes to that memory; making that pointer const would be incorrect.\n- The call to memcpy uses LocalBuffer as the source; memcpy expects a const-qualified source parameter and LocalBuffer is const, so this is correct.\n- There are no other pointer declarations or uses in this function that could be more const-qualified without preventing required modifications.\n\nBased on the above, there are no code fragments here that should be flagged for further investigation under Rule 8.13."
