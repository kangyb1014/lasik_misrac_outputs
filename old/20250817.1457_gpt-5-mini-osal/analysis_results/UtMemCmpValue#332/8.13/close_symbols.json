  "explanation": "uint8: The analysis must know the actual typedef/definition of uint8 (e.g. typedef unsigned char uint8; or some other typedef). If uint8 were itself a pointer typedef or already const-qualified, the const-qualification of 'const uint8 *Byte_ptr' and the parameter 'const void *Memory' would have different meanings. Confirming the underlying type is required to decide whether the pointer in this function points to a const-qualified target type.\n\nuint32: Although not a pointer here, you must know the typedef of uint32 to rule out the unlikely case that it is a pointer typedef or otherwise unusual type; this affects whether the function signature or local usage has hidden pointer const-qualification issues.\n\nbool: The return type's definition (typedef or macro) must be known to ensure no unexpected typedef-to-pointer or qualifier behavior is hiding in type aliases that could affect the MISRA const-pointer analysis.\n\ndeclaration/prototype of UtMemCmpValue (header): The external declaration/prototype in headers may differ in const-qualification from the definition here. MISRA checks compare the declared interface with the definition; a mismatch (e.g. header omitting const) could constitute a violation or indicate inconsistent use of const.\n\ntypedefs/macros that define or alter const/pointer semantics in the project headers (e.g. Platform_Types.h, stdint-like headers): Any project-specific typedefs or macros that introduce qualifiers, alias pointer types, or redefine basic types can change the effective type seen here. The MISRA rule depends on the effective pointed-to type being const-qualified; therefore all relevant typedef/macro definitions that could affect uint8/uint32/bool or the meaning of 'const' must be inspected."
