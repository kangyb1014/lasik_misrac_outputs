  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the presented code. The function uses standard C constructs: a for loop, array indexing (Byte_ptr[i]), implicit conversion from const void* to const uint8* (per C standard), and return of a boolean value. The integer types shown (uint8, uint32) are typedefs to standard stdint.h types (uint8_t, uint32_t) as provided in the additional code, so they are not compiler extensions. The identifier bool is a standard C boolean type when provided via <stdbool.h> (or could be a project typedef); in either case its use is not inherently a compiler language extension. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __extension__, pragmas with compiler-specific syntax, inline assembler, nonstandard storage-class specifiers, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
