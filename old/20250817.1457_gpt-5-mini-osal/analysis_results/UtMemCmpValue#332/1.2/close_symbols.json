  "explanation": "To decide if this function uses compiler language extensions you must know how the non\u2011standard-looking types and boolean values are defined and what language mode the compiler is using: \n\n- bool / true / false: Determine whether these are the C99 stdbool macros (which expand to _Bool/true/false and are standard C), C++ built\u2011in keywords, or compiler/vendor extensions (e.g. a typedef or macro introduced by the toolchain). That decides if use of 'bool' here is a standard C feature or an extension.\n\n- uint8 / uint32: These names are not standard C identifiers (the standard fixed-width names are uint8_t/uint32_t). You must locate their typedefs/defines to see whether they are aliases defined in standard headers (via typedefs from uint8_t/uint32_t) or are vendor/compiler extensions or macros. If they come from a proprietary header or use compiler-specific keywords, that could violate the MISRA rule.\n\n- stdbool.h / stdint.h: Check whether these standard headers are included (and used) to provide the boolean and integer types, which would indicate standard C usage. If the project uses nonstandard headers instead, that must be inspected for extensions.\n\n- __cplusplus: The predefined macro indicates whether the translation unit is being compiled as C++ (where 'bool' is a built\u2011in keyword). Knowing the language mode (C vs C++) is necessary because use of C++ built\u2011in types in a C project or reliance on C++ language features would be a language extension relative to C MISRA rules.\n\nThese symbols (and the locations/definitions they map to) are sufficient to determine whether the code uses standard C facilities or relies on compiler/vendor language extensions."
