  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or other C string comparison functions such as strcmp/strncmp) are present in the provided code. The function UtMemCmpValue implements an explicit byte-wise comparison against a provided length (Length) and a byte Value; it operates on raw memory, not null-terminated strings. The identifier contains \u201cMemCmp\u201d but this is a user-defined function, not the stdlib memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
