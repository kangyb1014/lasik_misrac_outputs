  "explanation": "For MISRA rule checking we must know whether UtMemCmpValue is ever used to compare null-terminated strings. The items above are required because:\n\n- uint8 (typedef): to understand the element size and signedness being compared (affects interpreting Memory as a byte array vs char string).\n- uint32 (typedef): to know the width/limits of Length and whether truncation/overflow could affect comparison semantics.\n- bool (typedef / stdbool.h): to map true/false return values and confirm expected semantics.\n- Prototype/declaration of UtMemCmpValue: to confirm linkage/visibility and any attributes affecting how it is used.\n- All call sites (callers) of UtMemCmpValue with source locations: the primary evidence of whether the function is used to compare strings \u2014 the rule is about usage, not the implementation alone.\n- Types of the actual arguments passed as Memory at each call site: if callers pass char * or const char * (or string literals), the buffer may be a NUL-terminated string.\n- Definitions/initializers of buffers/variables passed as Memory: to determine whether those buffers are documented/initialized as NUL-terminated strings (e.g., \"abc\\0\").\n- Expressions used to compute Length at each call site and their definitions: if Length is computed from strlen(...), or is strlen()+1, or otherwise derived from string length, it indicates a string comparison; if Length is sizeof a char[] that contains a NUL, that also matters.\n- Any macros or wrapper functions that forward to UtMemCmpValue: callers may be indirect; wrappers could hide string-oriented uses.\n- Relevant string/memory functions used in the same translation unit or callers (strlen, strcmp, strcpy, memcmp) and their call sites: to detect patterns where callers use standard string APIs together with UtMemCmpValue (e.g., Length = strlen(a); UtMemCmpValue(a, ..., Length)).\n\nCollecting these symbols allows the next analyst to decide if UtMemCmpValue is being used to compare null-terminated strings (which would implicate the MISRA rule about not using memcmp-style comparisons for NUL-terminated strings), or if it is strictly used for raw memory/byte-array comparisons (which would not violate that rule)."
