This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether UtMemCmpValue can access memory out of bounds (and to confirm it does not indirectly violate the MISRA rule about string.h calls), the analyzer needs: the exact typedefs for uint8, uint32, and bool so the element size and types are known; every caller of UtMemCmpValue (from the static call graph) so the contexts of use are examined; the concrete declarations and sizes of the buffers passed as Memory in each caller so Length can be compared to the actual object bounds; the expressions or macros used to produce the Length parameter so their value ranges are known; the allocation/initialization sites (malloc, stack arrays, static buffers) to verify the allocated size and pointer provenance; any local wrappers or macros that forward to standard <string.h> functions in the same translation unit or call chain so the analysis can detect indirect use of the prohibited standard functions; any header/project annotations or calling-convention information that constrain pointer/buffer semantics; and any compile-time limits or macros that cap Length. With these symbols the next agent can determine (1) whether Byte_ptr[i] can index beyond the referenced object for any call site, and (2) whether any banned <string.h> function is used directly or indirectly in the path relevant to this function."
