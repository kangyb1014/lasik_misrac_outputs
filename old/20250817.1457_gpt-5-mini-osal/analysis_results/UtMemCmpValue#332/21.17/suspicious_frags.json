  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code, so MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 (which specifically targets use of the string.h functions) is not directly applicable. The function performs direct byte-wise indexing via a pointer cast (const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory; Byte_ptr[i]), which could cause out-of-bounds accesses if the caller supplies a Length larger than the actual object size; however, that is not a violation of Rule 21.17 because no string.h functions are used. Potential bounds-checking issues should be considered under other MISRA rules concerned with pointer use and object bounds, but they are outside the scope of Rule 21.17, so no code fragments need to be reported for investigation under this rule."
