  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMemCmpValue:\n```c\nbool UtMemCmpValue(const void *Memory, uint8 Value, uint32 Length)\n{\n    uint32       i;\n    const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < Length; i++)\n    {\n        if (Byte_ptr[i] != Value)\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtMemCmpValue:\ntypedef uint8_t   uint8\n...\ntypedef uint32_t  uint32\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (i = 0; i < Length; i++)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. First clause (i = 0) initializes the single loop counter i. Second clause (i < Length) has no persistent side effects, uses the loop counter and another object (Length) that is not modified in the loop body. Third clause (i++) modifies only the loop counter. There is only one loop counter and it is not modified in the loop body. Therefore the for statement is well-formed under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
