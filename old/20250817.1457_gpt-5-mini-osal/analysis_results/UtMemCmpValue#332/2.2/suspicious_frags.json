  "explanation": "No code fragments appear to be dead code. Each statement has an effect on program behaviour:\n- The pointer assignment (const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;) is required to access the memory as bytes. Removing it would change the implementation.\n- The loop control variable and the for loop perform the required per-byte comparisons; removal would change behaviour (including the Length==0 case, which correctly yields true by falling through).\n- The if (Byte_ptr[i] != Value) { return false; } early return is necessary to stop on the first mismatch and affects timing/behaviour.\n- The final return true; is reached when all bytes match and is required for correct function result.\nThere is no unreachable code (no code after an unconditional return that cannot be reached), nor any executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code)."
