  "explanation": "To determine whether any code inside UtMemCmpValue is unreachable you must know whether any branch/loop body can be executed in the program. That requires: (1) the basic typedefs (bool,uint8,uint32) so the analyzer knows type ranges/representations; (2) every caller of UtMemCmpValue because only callers supply the runtime arguments that control reachability; (3) the exact symbols that produce Length at each call (variables, globals, macros, constants) because if Length is always 0 or a compile\u2011time constant the loop body may never execute; (4) the symbols that produce Value at each call because a constant Value combined with known buffer contents can make the if\u2011condition always true/false; (5) the definitions and initializations of the Memory buffers passed (their allocation and contents) since known buffer contents can make the comparison result constant; (6) any inline functions/macros used to form the three arguments because they can hide constant propagation or control flow; and (7) compile\u2011time configuration macros/static assertions that constrain argument values (e.g. always zero length) which would make parts of the function provably unreachable. These symbols let a static analyser determine whether the loop, the if body (return false) or the final return true can ever be executed, which is necessary to assess violation of the MISRA unreachable\u2011code rule."
