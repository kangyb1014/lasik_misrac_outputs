  "explanation": "No unreachable code was found in the provided function. The return false inside the loop is reachable whenever a byte differs from Value; the final return true is reachable when the loop completes (including the case Length == 0). There are no statements following a return, no mutually exclusive conditions or constant expressions that make any branch impossible, and no conditional compilation or labels that would render code unreachable. Therefore no code fragments need to be investigated for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
