  "explanation": "No fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8. Analysis: the pointer parameter Memory is declared const void * and is never modified; the code creates a local pointer (const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory) \u2014 this copies the value but does not alter the parameter itself. The loop only reads through Byte_ptr[i] and does not write to the pointed-to objects (Byte_ptr is const). The scalar parameters Value and Length are passed by value and are not assigned to or modified in the function. There are no operations that reassign or increment any parameter (no Memory = ..., no Memory++, no Value = ..., no Length = ...). Therefore there is no violation of the rule in this function."
