  "explanation": "- uint8: typedef or macro that defines the type of Value and the pointed-to type of Byte_ptr. The analysis must know whether uint8 is an integral type (e.g., unsigned char) or some non-standard/macro expansion that could change semantics (e.g., a pointer typedef). This affects whether indexing Byte_ptr[i] and comparing to Value could imply any hidden modification of parameters.\n- uint32: typedef or macro for Length. Needed to confirm it is a simple integer type and not a macro/typedef that could hide side effects (for example, an accessor macro that modifies state). Knowing the actual type ensures that loop control (i < Length) does not cause implicit writes to the parameter.\n- bool: typedef or macro for the return type. Required to know whether bool is a plain scalar type (e.g., from <stdbool.h>) or a macro/enum that could have unusual semantics.\n- true / false: definitions of these boolean constants (macros or enum values). Required to ensure that the return statements (return false; return true;) are simple constant returns and do not expand to function-like macros or expressions that could modify a parameter.\n\nRationale: The MISRA rule in question focuses on whether any function parameter object (the pointer variable Memory, or the scalar parameters Value/Length) is modified inside the function. To be sure there are no hidden modifications coming from typedefs or macros, the concrete definitions of the above symbols are needed: they establish that Value/Length are plain scalar values and that the boolean returns are simple constants, not macro invocations with side effects."
