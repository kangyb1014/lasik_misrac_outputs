  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you need any symbols that are referenced (directly or indirectly) by OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl and that could contain or call code using memcmp on strings. Reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: This global array is indexed by idtype to produce impl. Its contents or initializers might be created elsewhere using functions that call memcmp on strings (or store pointers to objects that do). The table contents must be inspected to ensure no string-comparing memcmp is introduced via stored objects or their initialization.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: Definition of the struct type returned from the table. The struct may contain fields, wrapper types, or inline helper functions that themselves call memcmp on strings; you must see its definition to know what code/fields are reachable from impl.\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: The cleanup handler pushed before the timed wait is executed if a cancellation occurs. Its implementation could call memcmp on strings; because it is executed (or at least referenced) by the target function, its body must be inspected.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop: These macros expand into code that registers/unregisters the cleanup handler. Although the POSIX library implementations typically do not use memcmp on strings, the macros expand to runtime constructs that reference the cleanup handler; include them to inspect any platform-specific expansions or wrappers.\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: This library call is invoked by the function; while standard pthread implementations are not expected to compare C strings with memcmp, a platform-specific wrapper could. Include it to confirm no string-comparing memcmp is introduced by the call or by any wrappers/stubs used in this build.\n\n- clock_gettime: Called to populate ts. Include to verify there are no platform-specific wrappers or inlined implementations that use memcmp on strings.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t: Types of impl->mutex and impl->cond. If these are typedefs or wrappers (e.g., custom types that hide additional behavior), their definitions must be examined for any memcmp usage.\n\n- module/initializer(s) that populate OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: Any module init functions or static initializers that build or register entries in OS_impl_objtype_lock_table must be checked because they may call memcmp (for example, when registering names/IDs) and those calls would be reachable indirectly from this code path.\n\nNote: The target function itself has no direct use of memcmp or string operations. The analysis must therefore focus on the global table contents, the struct/type definitions, the cleanup handler implementation, and any platform-specific wrappers for the POSIX calls listed above to ensure no memcmp-on-NT-strings is introduced indirectly."
