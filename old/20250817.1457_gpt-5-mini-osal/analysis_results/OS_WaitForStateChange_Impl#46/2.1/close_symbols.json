  "explanation": "For a reachable-code (MISRA) analysis we must know any definitions that can change control flow or make parts of this function impossible to reach. Briefly why each is required:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The value fetched from this table (impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]) is used immediately. If the table or its entries are defined in a way that causes non-local control flow (e.g., a macro that expands to a call that does not return) or if an index operation is guaranteed to fault/terminate, that could make subsequent code unreachable. The table definition is needed to rule that out.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The concrete type (and in particular the impl->cond and impl->mutex members) must be known to ensure these member accesses are ordinary field accesses and not macros or inline functions that alter control flow. A non-standard definition could make later code unreachable.\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: This cleanup handler is registered with pthread_cleanup_push. If this symbol were defined as non-returning (noreturn) or doing longjmp/exit, or otherwise changing control flow, it could make code after the push unreachable (or change semantics of the cleanup pairing). Its definition/attributes are required.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop: These are macros (or library shims) that expand into control-flow constructs. The exact expansion must be known so a static checker can determine the real blocks of code protected by the cleanup handler and whether the pop is actually reachable/paired. Some implementations expand to complex blocks; the analyzer needs the real expansion.\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: This call is a potential cancellation point and can affect control flow (it may return, be interrupted, or cause the cleanup handler to run). The function signature/attributes (noreturn, longjmp, etc.) must be known to decide reachability of the code that follows it.\n\n- clock_gettime and CLOCK_REALTIME: Although unlikely to be non-returning, a non-standard macro or replacement could redirect control flow (e.g., to abort). Their definitions are needed to rule out such cases and to ensure the time-setting code path is reachable.\n\n- struct timespec: Knowing the structure layout is necessary only if its definition contains unusual macros or bitfields that change semantics; include it to be certain that the manipulation of ts.tv_nsec/tv_sec is ordinary code and does not introduce unreachable paths.\n\nTogether these symbols cover all external definitions and macros that can affect whether any statements in OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl are reachable. An analyzer can use them to prove (or disprove) that no part of the function is statically unreachable."
