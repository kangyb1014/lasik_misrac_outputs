  "explanation": "For checking whether code in OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl is dead (i.e. can be removed without affecting program behaviour) the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The function reads impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]. To determine if the read and subsequent operations on *impl* can have observable effects (or if impl can be NULL/invalid or constant), the table's declaration, initialization and possible aliasing/side-effects must be known.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The full definition of this struct (especially the types/names of members 'cond' and 'mutex') is required to know what operations on impl->cond/impl->mutex actually do, and whether accessing them has side effects or observable behaviour.\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: The cleanup handler pushed by pthread_cleanup_push could perform any actions (unlocking the mutex, signalling, logging, longjmp, etc.). Its body is essential to decide whether the pthread_cleanup_push/pop pair is observable and therefore not dead.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop: These are macros (or functions) with specific semantics: they register/unregister a cleanup handler and pthread_cleanup_pop's argument controls whether the handler runs. Understanding their expansion and semantics (interaction with thread cancellation and control flow) is necessary to know whether the push/pop sequence has runtime effects that cannot be removed.\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: The call is a cancellation point and has well-defined behaviour (wait on condition variable, atomically release and reacquire the mutex, possible timeouts, return codes). Its semantics produce observable synchronization and timing effects; they must be known to decide if the call (or its surrounding ts computations) is essential.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t: The concrete types and their behavior (especially how timedwait manipulates the mutex) are needed to reason about locking/unlocking side effects and whether removing mutex/cond related code changes program behaviour.\n\n- clock_gettime: The function is used to populate ts; whether it has side effects (e.g., reading a realtime clock) matters for timing behaviour \u2014 removal could alter timing-dependent behaviour, which per MISRA notes is relevant.\n\n- CLOCK_REALTIME: The clock id chosen affects the reported time; knowing which clock is used is important when assessing timing/temporal behaviour and whether the ts computations are meaningful.\n\n- struct timespec: Definition (tv_sec, tv_nsec widths/units) is required to determine whether the arithmetic on ts (adding ns and normalizing to seconds) is meaningful and potentially observable.\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange (caller): The calling context may establish preconditions (for example, that the mutex is already locked) or rely on side effects of this implementation. To determine if this function's operations can be removed without changing behaviour, the caller's expectations and usage must be known.\n\n- osal_objtype_t: The index type into OS_impl_objtype_lock_table; its range and guarantees (valid values, potential out-of-range behavior) affect whether the table lookup and subsequent operations are ever executed or are no-op/undefined.\n\nTogether, these symbols provide the necessary type, semantic and call-context information to decide whether the assignments, time calculations, the pthread cleanup push/pop and the timed-wait call are actually contributing observable behaviour (synchronization, timing, resource release) or could be considered dead code."
