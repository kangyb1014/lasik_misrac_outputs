  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the pointer 'impl' is used to access and modify synchronization objects (impl->mutex and impl->cond) which must be passed as non-const pointers to pthread APIs (e.g. pthread_cond_timedwait takes non-const pointers). Making 'impl' point to a const-qualified type would prevent required mutation, so the non-const pointer is appropriate."
