  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer 'impl' is used to access and pass &impl->mutex and &impl->cond to pthread APIs (pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cond_timedwait) which require mutable objects (non-const pointers). Since the pointed-to data is intended to be modified/used by these APIs, making the pointer point to a const-qualified type would be inappropriate. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated in this code fragment."
