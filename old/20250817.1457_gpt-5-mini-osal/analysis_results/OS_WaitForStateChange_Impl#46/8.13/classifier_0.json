  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer passed (&impl->mutex) is intended for use with pthread_cleanup_push and the cleanup routine that will release/unlock the mutex. The cleanup API takes a void* (non-const) and the mutex is a mutable object that will be modified by the cleanup handler, so it cannot reasonably be const-qualified. Therefore this use does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
