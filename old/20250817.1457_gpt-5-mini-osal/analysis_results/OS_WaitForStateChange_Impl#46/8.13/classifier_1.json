  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The POSIX prototype is pthread_cond_timedwait(pthread_cond_t *restrict, pthread_mutex_t *restrict, const struct timespec *restrict), so the third parameter is const-qualified; passing &ts is implicitly converted to const struct timespec*. There is no pointer variable declared without const here. (A concrete violation would be if code declared a pointer like 'struct timespec *p = &ts;' when p is only used for read access \u2014 that pointer should be 'const struct timespec *p'.)"
