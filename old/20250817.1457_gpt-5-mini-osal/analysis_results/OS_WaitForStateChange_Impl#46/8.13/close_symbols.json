  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why needed to decide whether pointers could/should be const):\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t (struct definition): The function uses impl->mutex and impl->cond; you must know their exact types and whether they are objects or pointers and whether they are modified elsewhere to decide if impl (the pointer variable) or the members could/should be const-qualified.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (declaration/type): The assignment impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]; requires knowing the table element type (pointer-to-what or array-of-objects) and any const qualifiers on the table, which affects whether impl could be declared as a pointer-to-const.\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex (function prototype): Passed as the cleanup handler with &impl->mutex; its parameter type (e.g., pthread_mutex_t * or const pthread_mutex_t *) determines whether the pointed-to mutex must be mutable and thus whether the pointer could be to const.\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait (function prototype): Its parameter types (pthread_cond_t *, pthread_mutex_t *, const struct timespec *) show which arguments are modified by the call. Knowing that cond and mutex parameters are non-const pointers demonstrates those pointed objects must be mutable (so pointers to const would be inappropriate). The third parameter being const struct timespec * also informs whether passing &ts is acceptable and whether ts could/should be const.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop (macro/prototypes): These determine the expected type of the cleanup routine and its void* argument; specifically, the cleanup push passes &impl->mutex as a void* to the cleanup routine, so the routine prototype affects whether that pointer should be to const or non-const.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t typedefs: The underlying typedefs (are these opaque structs or pointers?) clarify whether &impl->mutex yields a pointer-to-object that can be const-qualified and whether functions operate on the object via non-const access.\n\n- struct timespec definition: To confirm the fields modified in this function and to check that pthread_cond_timedwait expects a const struct timespec *, establishing whether ts needs to be mutable or can be const.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets an analyst determine which pointers are required to be mutable by called APIs and by local modifications, and therefore whether any pointer declarations in the function could/should be changed to point to const-qualified types under the MISRA rule."
