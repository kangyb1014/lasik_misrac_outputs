  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to check MISRA rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\":\n\n- osal_objtype_t: determine whether parameter idtype is an integer/enum (passed by value) or some pointer/type that could be aliased/modified. If it were a pointer typedef, indexing or other use might indirectly modify a referent.\n\n- uint32: determine whether attempts is an integer value type (passed by value) rather than a typedef to a pointer or an object that could be modified via indirection.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: definition of the struct for impl (fields mutex, cond). Needed to confirm that taking &impl->mutex or &impl->cond does not take the address of a function parameter and thus does not modify the parameter itself.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: declaration/type of this symbol (array or accessor). Needed to confirm that OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype] is a simple array indexing (using idtype as a read-only index) and that the indexing expression or table accessor does not modify idtype.\n\n- struct timespec: layout and member names (tv_sec, tv_nsec) to confirm ts is a local object and that modifications (ts.tv_nsec, ts.tv_sec) are to a local variable, not to a parameter.\n\n- clock_gettime: prototype to ensure it does not take or modify addresses of the function parameters (verifies calls do not indirectly modify idtype or attempts).\n\n- pthread_cond_timedwait: prototype/semantics to confirm it cannot modify the function parameters (e.g., it only uses the supplied cond and mutex pointers and the ts pointer), and that it does not accept addresses of the function parameters.\n\n- pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop: macro expansions/semantics to verify they do not capture or modify the function parameters (ensure the cleanup mechanism does not store pointers/addresses to idtype or attempts that could be modified).\n\n- OS_Posix_ReleaseTableMutex: prototype to ensure the cleanup handler argument (&impl->mutex) is not related to a function parameter and that the handler does not modify parameters.\n\n- OS_WaitForStateChange: caller/prototype to confirm how this function is invoked (ensures no wrapper/macro passes parameters in a way that would make them modifiable within OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl).\n\nIn short, these symbols let an analyst verify the concrete types and macro expansions so they can be sure neither idtype nor attempts are assigned to, passed by reference, or otherwise modified (directly or indirectly) inside OS_WaitForStateChange_Impl."
