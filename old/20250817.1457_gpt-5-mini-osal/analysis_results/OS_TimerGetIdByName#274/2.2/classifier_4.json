  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TimerGetIdByName:\n```c\nint32 OS_TimerGetIdByName(osal_id_t *timer_id, const char *timer_name)\n{\n    int32          return_code;\n    osal_objtype_t objtype;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(timer_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(timer_name);\n\n    /*\n     * Check our context.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No \u2014 in the given code this is not a violation. BUGCHECK_VOID(String != NULL) is a runtime argument check macro (used elsewhere as BUGCHECK), so removing it would change program behaviour when String is NULL (it triggers the bug-check handler). Therefore it is not dead code. (Note: it would be a violation only if BUGCHECK_VOID were defined as a pure no-op or as merely (void)(String != NULL) so that the executed operation had no effect; in that hypothetical case the statement would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.)"
