Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The fragments listed above are places where operations may be executed but potentially have no observable effect in some build/configuration combinations (for example macros that may compile to nothing, diagnostic/debug branches, or ID/type checks that may never be true). These should be investigated to determine whether they constitute dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2.\n\nOther code in the provided snippets was not marked as suspicious because it performs observable, functional work that would change program behaviour if removed: examples include the call and return of OS_ObjectIdFindByName and its use of the token to set *object_id and release it; the return of return_code from OS_TimerGetIdByName; the vsnprintf formatting, truncation logic and subsequent OS_ConsoleWrite in OS_printf; and the return self_record.id in OS_TaskGetId_Impl. These operations directly affect program state or outputs and therefore are not candidate dead code for Rule 2.2 without further evidence."
