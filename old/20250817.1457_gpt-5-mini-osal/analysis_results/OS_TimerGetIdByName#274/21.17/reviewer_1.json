The call can lead to out-of-bounds string accesses in the downstream name checks. OS_TimerGetIdByName forwards timer_name to OS_ObjectIdFindByName which performs ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK and then name-based search routines. If LENGTHCHECK (or the search/match callbacks) uses string.h functions such as strlen/strcmp on the supplied pointer, and the caller passed a non-NULL pointer that is not NUL-terminated within its valid object bounds (or the buffer is shorter than OS_MAX_API_NAME), these functions will read beyond the bounds of the object. Example: caller provides an 8-byte buffer without a terminating '\\0'; LENGTHCHECK calls strlen(name) (expecting a terminator within OS_MAX_API_NAME), strlen will read past the 8 bytes until a NUL is found (or crash) \u2014 this is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_TimerGetIdByName_Log(const char *stage, void *timer_id_ptr, const char *timer_name_ptr, unsigned int objtype, int32_t return_code)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2199.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Log the stage, pointer values and numeric state.

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s scenario is plausible but the report as stated is not correct. The MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 prohibits uses of <string.h> functions that can read past the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The code shown for OS_TimerGetIdByName does not itself call any <string.h> functions \u2014 it only checks for non-NULL pointers and forwards the timer_name pointer to OS_ObjectIdFindByName. Therefore OS_TimerGetIdByName itself does not directly violate Rule 21.17.\n\nA real violation would occur only if the downstream routine (OS_ObjectIdFindByName, or any callbacks it invokes) uses string.h functions (e.g. strlen/strcmp) on the supplied pointer without guaranteeing it is NUL-terminated within the object bounds or otherwise bounding the access. If OS_ObjectIdFindByName performs an unbounded strlen on an input that may be a non-terminated buffer, that downstream code would violate 21.17. But you must inspect that callee\u2019s implementation (and the API contract for timer_name) to determine whether such unsafe use actually exists. \n\nSummary: the claim that OS_TimerGetIdByName itself violates MISRA 21.17 is incorrect (is_report_correct = false). The scenario describes a potential violation in the downstream lookup routine if it uses unbounded string functions; to confirm a real MISRA violation you must review OS_ObjectIdFindByName\u2019s implementation or the documented preconditions on timer_name."
