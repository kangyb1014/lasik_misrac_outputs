  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_TimerGetIdByName code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_TimerGetIdByName.\n```c\nint32 OS_TimerGetIdByName(osal_id_t *timer_id, const char *timer_name)\n{\n    int32          return_code;\n    osal_objtype_t objtype;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(timer_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(timer_name);\n\n    /*\n     * Check our context.

The surrounding comment indicates OS_ObjectIdFindByName may be called with name==NULL (or with non-NUL-terminated buffers supplied by callers). If LENGTHCHECK calls strlen(name) unconditionally, this can read past the bounds of the object referenced by 'name' (or dereference a NULL pointer), which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_TimerGetIdByName_Log(const char *stage, const void *timer_id, const void *timer_name, int objtype, int return_code)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2199.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Log stage, pointer values and integer states. Do not dereference timer_name. */\n        fprintf(f, \"OS_TimerGetIdByName: stage=%s, timer_id=%p, timer_name=%p, objtype=%d, return_code=%d\\n\",\n                stage, timer_id, timer_name, objtype, return_code);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nint32 OS_TimerGetIdByName(osal_id_t *timer_id, const char *timer_name)\n{\n    int32          return_code;\n    osal_objtype_t objtype;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(timer_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(timer_name);\n\n    /* Log after parameter checks to avoid logging potentially invalid pointers. */\n    OS_TimerGetIdByName_Log(\"after_checks\", (const void *)timer_id, (const void *)timer_name, (int)0, (int)0);\n\n    /*\n     * Check our context.

  "explanation": "The provided OS_TimerGetIdByName implementation itself does not call any of the <string.h> functions, so there is no direct evidence in this function that a string.h call will access beyond the bounds of the object. The function does perform OS_CHECK_POINTER(timer_name) before passing timer_name on, which (assuming the macro works as intended) prevents a NULL dereference at the call site. Agent A\u2019s scenario depends on the implementation of OS_ObjectIdFindByName (and/or the LENGTHCHECK macro it may use) performing an unconditional strlen (or similar) on timer_name without ensuring NUL-termination or an upper bound. That would be a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 \u2014 but the fault would lie in OS_ObjectIdFindByName/LENGTHCHECK, not in OS_TimerGetIdByName itself.\n\nConclusion: the report as applied to OS_TimerGetIdByName is not correct. There is insufficient evidence in the shown code to conclude a Rule 21.17 violation; instead, review the implementations of OS_ObjectIdFindByName and LENGTHCHECK to determine whether they ensure the string is within bounds (or use length-limited routines) before calling string.h functions."
