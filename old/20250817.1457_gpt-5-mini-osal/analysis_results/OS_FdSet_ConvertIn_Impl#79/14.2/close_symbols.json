The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking MISRA \"for loop well-formed\" on the outer for(offset = 0; offset < sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids); ++offset):\n\n- OS_FdSet (definition of type and member object_ids): The second clause uses sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids). You must know the exact declaration/type of object_ids to determine whether sizeof(...) is a compile-time property and whether object_ids (or OSAL_set) could be modified by the loop body or by called macros/functions. Confirming object_ids is an array (and its element type) shows the bound does not depend on a modifiable object.\n\n- OSAL_set->object_ids (type and compile-time size): More specifically, the exact type and declared size of object_ids are needed to determine whether the second clause is a pure expression that uses only the loop counter (it must not depend on an object modified in the loop body) and has no persistent side effects.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro/function used to compute id): This is invoked inside the loop body. If it has side effects (modifies globals, or aliases/updates the loop counter 'offset' or any object used in the for clauses), the for-loop could violate the rule. The macro/function body must be inspected to ensure it is side-effect-free w.r.t. loop-control objects.\n\n- osal_index_t (typedef of id): Knowing the type of id allows checking whether OSAL_INDEX_C or conversions could involve hidden side effects or references to objects that the loop clauses use. It also clarifies whether id is a simple local integer (safe) or a more complex type.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: Appears in the loop body condition (if (... && id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES)). Confirm this symbol is a compile-time constant or otherwise not an object that the loop body modifies; if it were modifiable by the loop body or by called routines, that could invalidate the clause restrictions.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (definition and element type/fields: fd and selectable): The body reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd and .selectable. If accessing this array invokes side effects (e.g., via accessor macros or overloaded operators in unusual environments) or if the table aliases/updates the loop counter or objects used in the for clauses, that matters. Inspecting its definition guarantees the body-only modifies local state (objids, bit, id) and not loop-control objects.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE: Used in a comparison inside the body. Ensure FD_SETSIZE is a simple constant macro and not an object that could be modified in the loop body.\n\n- FD_SET (macro/function): FD_SET is called in the body; macros can expand to code with side effects on objects beyond os_set (rare but possible). You must verify FD_SET does not modify the loop counter (offset) or any object referenced in the for clauses. MISRA requires considering called functions/macros as part of the loop body behavior.\n\n- fd_set (type): To understand FD_SET's expansion and side effects you need the fd_set type definition (how FD_SET manipulates internal fields), to confirm it does not interact with loop-control objects.\n\n- uint8 (typedef): The objids variable is of type uint8 and is shifted inside the loop. Knowing its definition ensures the right semantics for objids manipulation (e.g., if uint8 were a macro with side effects) and confirms that objids is a local variable, not a shared object affecting the for clauses.\n\nSummary: The essential checks are (a) the loop counter is 'offset' and the third clause only modifies offset (++offset), (b) the second clause sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids) is free of side effects and does not depend on any object modified in the loop body, and (c) no called macro/function in the body (notably OSAL_INDEX_C and FD_SET) or array accesses modify loop-control objects. The listed symbols provide the definitions necessary to verify these points."
