  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for the MISRA-C const-pointer analysis:\n\n- fd_set (type from <sys/select.h>): needed to know the semantics of the fd_set object passed as fd_set *os_set and whether it is modified by operations; determining if the pointer must be non-const requires knowing the type layout and typical usage.\n\n- FD_SET (macro): this macro is invoked with os_set. It is necessary to inspect FD_SET to confirm that it mutates the fd_set pointed-to (i.e., writes into *os_set). If FD_SET modifies the object, os_set cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE (macro): used in the code to check bounds before calling FD_SET. Knowing its definition helps confirm the conditional path that leads to modification of os_set. (It also documents why certain fds are rejected rather than written.)\n\n- OS_FdSet (struct) including object_ids member: the function takes const OS_FdSet *OSAL_set. To justify the const qualification of this parameter (or to find a violation), the structure definition is needed to confirm that only read-only accesses are performed (object_ids is read with sizeof and indexing) and no writes to the pointed-to object occur.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro): used to compute id from the bit index. Inspecting this macro ensures that computing id does not cause any hidden writes through OSAL_set (e.g., via side-effects) and that OSAL_set is indeed only read.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (global array) and its element type/definition (fields: fd, selectable): the code reads OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd and .selectable. The element type must be inspected to confirm these accesses are reads only (no hidden writes or pointer aliases that would require non-const qualification of any parameter). Also confirms that no pointers to os_set/os_maxfd are taken or modified via this table.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro): used in the id-range check. Knowing its value/definition helps ensure id comparisons are correct and that accesses to OS_impl_filehandle_table are read-only in-bounds operations (relevant to reasoning about side effects and constness).\n\n- osal_index_t (typedef) and uint8 (typedef): to understand the widths and signedness used when computing indices and shifting object_ids. They help verify there are no hidden modifications (e.g., via integer promotions) that would affect whether any pointer parameter needs to be non-const.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule at issue requires pointer parameters to be const-qualified unless the function modifies the pointed-to object. To decide this for os_set and os_maxfd we must show whether the function (or macros it calls) modifies those objects. FD_SET (and knowledge of fd_set) and the explicit assignment to *os_maxfd are the central evidence. The remaining symbols (OS_FdSet, OSAL_INDEX_C, OS_impl_filehandle_table, OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES, osal_index_t, uint8) are required to confirm that OSAL_set is truly read-only and that no hidden side-effects exist that would force other pointer parameters to be non-const."
