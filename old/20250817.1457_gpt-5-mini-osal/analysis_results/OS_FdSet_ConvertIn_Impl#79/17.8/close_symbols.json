  "explanation": "To determine whether any of the function parameters (the pointer variables os_maxfd, os_set, OSAL_set) are themselves modified (which would violate the MISRA rule), the analyzer must know how macros and types used in the function expand and what side effects they have. Brief reasons for each symbol:\n\n- FD_SET (macro): This is the operation that appears to modify the fd_set passed in (os_set). The macro expansion must be inspected to ensure it only dereferences/modifies the object pointed to and does not assign to the pointer parameter variable os_set itself.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE (macro/constant): Used in the conditional that decides whether FD_SET is reached. Knowing its definition/value is needed to determine whether the code path that invokes FD_SET can be taken, which affects whether os_set may be modified.\n\n- fd_set (type definition): The layout (e.g., fields like fds_bits) is needed to understand how FD_SET manipulates the object and to confirm that FD_SET's effects are on the pointed-to object rather than reassigning the pointer parameter.\n\n- OS_FdSet (type definition of OSAL_set): The parameter OSAL_set is declared const; its definition (and const qualification) is needed to confirm that the function does not attempt to modify the pointer itself or the object in violation of const. Also needed to inspect object_ids usage.\n\n- OS_FdSet.object_ids (member type and array size): sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids) is used to drive the loops. The member's type and size are required to understand loop bounds and any potential operations that could modify OSAL_set itself (e.g., if a macro indexed into it had side effects).\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro): Converts bit/offset to an id. Its expansion must be checked for side effects (e.g., if it evaluated/modified its argument or any pointer) to ensure no pointer parameter is altered.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (global array) and its element type (fields: fd, selectable): The code reads fields from this table using the computed id; the field accesses must be confirmed as reads only and not invoking any macro/function that might modify pointer parameters. In particular, ensure accessing .fd/.selectable does not embed macros that could reassign the os_set or os_maxfd parameters.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): Used in the bound check for id. Its value affects whether the code path that reads the filehandle table (and then possibly calls FD_SET or writes *os_maxfd) is reachable; include to reason about whether pointer-dereference writes happen.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let an analyzer (1) inspect macro expansions for unintended assignments to the pointer parameters, (2) verify that modifications are only to the objects pointed-to (e.g., *os_maxfd, contents of *os_set), and (3) confirm loop/control-flow conditions that determine whether those modifications can occur."
