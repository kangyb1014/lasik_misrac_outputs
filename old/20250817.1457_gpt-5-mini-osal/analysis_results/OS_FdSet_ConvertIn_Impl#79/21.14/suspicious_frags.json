  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and related definitions. There is no use of the standard library function memcmp anywhere in OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl or in the supplied macros/definitions. The code performs only integer and bitwise operations, array indexing, structure/member access, and calls the FD_SET macro; it does not perform any string operations nor manipulate char pointers or null-terminated strings. There are no calls to other string-comparison functions (e.g., strcmp, strncmp) shown, nor any indirect evidence that memcmp is invoked through a macro or wrapper in the provided code. Therefore there are no fragments in this submission that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
