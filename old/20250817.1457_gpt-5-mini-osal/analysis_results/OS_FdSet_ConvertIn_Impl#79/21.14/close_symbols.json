  "explanation": "To decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any macros, types, constants, and data structures used by the function because such symbols can hide calls to library routines (including memcmp) or implement string comparisons indirectly. For each symbol:\n\n- FD_SET: macro (or function) used to set a bit in fd_set. Must be inspected to ensure its expansion/implementation does not call memcmp on strings.\n- FD_SETSIZE: constant that limits fd values. Check its definition only to ensure no side-effects or hidden helpers using memcmp.\n- fd_set (definition): the underlying type for os_set; its implementation/details/macros associated with it (in <sys/select.h> or platform headers) must be checked to ensure no memcmp-based string comparisons are used.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table: the global array referenced for file descriptors. Its initializer or accessor implementation could involve helper functions or macros that use memcmp; the table symbol must be inspected.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table[].fd: the fd field is read here; inspect its definition to ensure accessing it does not invoke any function/macro that internally uses memcmp for string comparisons.\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table[].selectable: this boolean/flag field is tested; ensure its accessor/definition does not hide memcmp usage.\n- OS_FdSet (definition): the type of OSAL_set passed in; its layout and any accessor macros/functions for object_ids must be inspected to ensure no memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- OS_FdSet.object_ids (type and element type/size): the loop iterates sizeof(object_ids) and shifts objids bytes; if object_ids were actually a string or manipulated by helpers, those helpers could use memcmp. Need the exact type (uint8_t array? char[]?) and element size.\n- OSAL_INDEX_C: macro used to form an osal_index_t from a numeric index. Macro expansion could call other helpers or perform conversions that use string comparisons; inspect it to be safe.\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: a limit constant used in comparisons. Check its definition to rule out any hidden function-like behavior that might use memcmp.\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED: status codes assigned/returned by the function. Their definitions should be checked only to ensure they are simple constants (not computed by helpers that use memcmp).\n- osal_index_t: the typedef for id; check its definition (integer vs struct) to ensure no hidden string compare operations.\n- uint8: typedef for objids; confirm it is an integer type (not a char alias or struct wrapper) so bit operations cannot be implemented via string comparisons.\n\nIn short: inspect all macros, typedefs, constants and data-structure definitions referenced by this function (FD_SET/fd_set, OS_FdSet and its object_ids, OS_impl_filehandle_table and its fields, and any macros that compute indices or limits). Any of these could hide a memcmp usage that compares null-terminated strings; verifying their definitions is necessary to conclude compliance with the MISRA rule."
