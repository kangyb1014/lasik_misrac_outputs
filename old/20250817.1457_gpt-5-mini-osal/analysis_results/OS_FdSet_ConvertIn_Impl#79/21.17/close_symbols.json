This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For a correct MISRA <string.h> compliance analysis we must be able to prove that no string.h routine is invoked (directly or via macros) and that no indexed write/read can go out of bounds. Each symbol below is needed for that reasoning:\n\n- OS_FdSet (structure definition): Needed to know whether object_ids is an actual array (and its element type) or a pointer, and to get the exact length (sizeof) of object_ids. The function loops up to sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids) and indexes that array; if object_ids is a pointer or has a different size than assumed this could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C (macro/function): The code maps (offset*8 + bit) through OSAL_INDEX_C to produce an id. We must inspect how this macro transforms the index (e.g. any casting, range adjustments) to determine whether the computed id can exceed table bounds or otherwise cause invalid indexing.\n\n- osal_index_t (typedef): The underlying integer type (signed/unsigned width) affects comparisons and wrapping behaviour when computing id and comparing with OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES. Needed to ensure the id arithmetic cannot overflow or compare incorrectly and lead to out-of-bounds indexing.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES (macro/constant): The code checks id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES before indexing OS_impl_filehandle_table. We need the actual value to confirm that the bound check is correct relative to the table size and to the range of id values produced.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table (array) and its element type/definition (fields: fd, selectable): Required to confirm the array length (so indexing by id is safe) and to know the types and semantics of the fd and selectable members. We must verify indexing by id cannot address past the array and whether accessing fd/selectable could involve any helper functions or macros that call string.h routines.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE (macro/constant): The code uses FD_SETSIZE to decide whether osfd is in-range for FD_SET. We need the actual FD_SETSIZE value to confirm the check prevents FD_SET from writing past the internal fd_set buffer.\n\n- fd_set type and FD_SET (macro) implementation: FD_SET is a macro that manipulates the fd_set object; some platform implementations may use inline operations or helper macros that could call memory routines (rare, but must be checked). We must inspect the fd_set layout and FD_SET implementation to ensure FD_SET will not invoke any string.h functions (memcpy/memset/etc.) nor write beyond the os_set buffer when given osfd < FD_SETSIZE. If FD_SET expands to operations on an internal array, confirm indices and mask calculations are safe.\n\n- uint8 (typedef): To be certain about the size/semantics of objids and the correctness of the right-shift loop (how many bits per element). This affects how many id values are produced from object_ids and therefore whether the id computation could exceed intended ranges.\n\nThese symbols collectively allow validating: (1) the loops/indices cannot produce out-of-range array accesses, (2) FD_SET will not perform hidden string.h calls or out-of-bounds writes, and (3) no indirect call or macro invoked by this function uses any of the string.h functions named by the MISRA rule. Without these definitions you cannot conclusively determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
