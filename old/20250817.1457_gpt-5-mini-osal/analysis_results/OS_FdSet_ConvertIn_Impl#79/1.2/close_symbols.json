  "explanation": "For each listed symbol, the analysis must inspect the symbol\u2019s definition to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used (MISRA check). Brief reasons: \n\n- OSAL_INDEX_C: This is used as an expression/translation of an index. If it is a macro it might use GCC/clang extensions (statement-expression ({...}), typeof, built-ins, __extension__, etc.) or nonstandard casting. The macro/inline definition is needed to detect such extensions.\n\n- OS_FdSet and object_ids: sizeof(OSAL_set->object_ids) and indexing/object_ids >>= 1 rely on the exact type/structure of object_ids (array, flexible array, bit-field, or other). The declaration could use extensions (flexible-array semantics, zero-length arrays, attributes, anonymous structures, packed/aligned keywords) that must be checked.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table and its element type (structure with fd and selectable): Accesses OS_impl_filehandle_table[id].fd and .selectable require the element type definition. That struct could use compiler extensions (bit-fields with nonstandard widths, anonymous unions/structs as extensions, attributes, or nonstandard types) which must be inspected.\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: This macro/constant influences the conditional and may itself be defined using extension syntax (e.g., complex macros, GCC integer suffixes or expressions using extension constructs). Its definition must be checked.\n\n- FD_SET macro: FD_SET is typically a macro manipulating fd_set internals. Implementations sometimes use nonstandard constructs (statement expressions, typeof, builtins). Its macro expansion must be examined for extensions.\n\n- FD_SETSIZE and fd_set: FD_SETSIZE is a macro constant; fd_set is a system type. Their definitions (in system headers) may include implementation-specific constructs or compiler extensions and are required to assess whether the code relies on such extensions.\n\n- int32, osal_index_t, uint8 typedefs: These underlying typedefs could be defined using compiler-specific types (e.g., __int128, nonstandard integer types) or attributes. Their definitions are required to ensure no language extensions are used in the types.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED: These status constants/macros might be defined via complex macros or use extension features; checking their definitions ensures no extension usage is hidden there.\n\nIn summary, to determine if the target function uses any compiler language extensions, the exact definitions/expansions of all macros, typedefs, and externally-declared objects it references must be inspected. The list above identifies the minimal set of such symbols whose definitions could contain extensions affecting the function."
