  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the supplied code fragments (the UtBinFile2Mem function and the shown macro/getter definitions). The code does not perform any string comparisons (only file I/O and an assertion call). The UtAssert_Failed macro expands to UtAssertEx(...), but the implementation of UtAssertEx is not included among the provided code; nothing in the shown definitions calls memcmp. Therefore there are no places in the provided code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If the reviewer wants to be thorough, they may inspect the implementation of UtAssertEx (not provided) or any other external modules, but within the supplied code there are no memcmp uses to flag."
