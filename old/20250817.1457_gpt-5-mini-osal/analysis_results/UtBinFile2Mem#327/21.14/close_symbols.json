  "explanation": "Explanation of why each symbol is required:\n- memcmp: the MISRA rule specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. You must locate all uses of memcmp to determine whether any call compares buffers that are (or may be) NUL-terminated strings \u2014 directly or via data read by UtBinFile2Mem.\n- strcmp / strncmp / strlen: these string APIs are needed to identify places where a buffer is intended as a null-terminated string (e.g. used with strcmp/strncmp/strlen). If buffers written by UtBinFile2Mem are later used with these functions, that indicates they are treated as NUL-terminated strings and any memcmp uses on them would violate the rule.\n- All call sites that invoke memcmp in the codebase: you must inspect each memcmp call site to see what arguments are passed (pointers, lengths) and whether those arguments can be null-terminated strings or point into buffers filled by UtBinFile2Mem.\n- All call sites that invoke UtBinFile2Mem (callers): to determine how the Memory argument is supplied (its declared type, intended usage, and lifetime) and whether callers subsequently treat that buffer as a C string or pass it to memcmp.\n- Definitions/declarations/allocations of the buffers passed as the Memory argument to UtBinFile2Mem: you need the buffer\u2019s declared type (char*, uint8_t*, struct, etc.), its allocated size, and any initialization/terminator behavior to decide whether it can hold or be treated as a null-terminated string.\n- fopen / fread / fclose / strerror / errno: standard-library semantics are required to reason about what UtBinFile2Mem does to the passed buffer (fread reads raw bytes and does not add a NUL terminator). Confirming these prototypes/behaviour ensures correct conclusions about whether the function itself produces NUL-terminated strings.\n- UtAssert_Failed / UtAssert_GetContext: these are called on the error path; include them to ensure they do not internally use memcmp or otherwise affect the analysis of whether buffers are treated as strings (and to fully understand side-effects from error handling)."
