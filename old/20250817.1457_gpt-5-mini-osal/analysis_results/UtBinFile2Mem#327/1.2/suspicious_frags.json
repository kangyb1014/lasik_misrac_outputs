  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. I inspected all constructs that might be mistaken for extensions and explain why they are standard C features (and therefore not to be reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2):\n\n- bool / true / false: use of the boolean type is a standard C feature when stdbool.h is available (or could be a project typedef). Either way, this is not a compiler extension.\n- uint32 (typedef of uint32_t): fixed-width integer typedefs are standard when using <stdint.h> or project typedefs; typedef itself is standard C.\n- Variadic macro (__VA_ARGS__) in UtAssert_Failed: variadic macros are part of standard C99 and are not a compiler extension.\n- Standard library types and functions (FILE, fopen, fread, fclose, strerror, errno): these are standard C library facilities, not language extensions.\n- Function definitions, pointer usage (void *Memory), return of bool, and the control-flow constructs used (if/else) are all standard C.\n\nNo compiler-specific tokens were present (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, nested functions, GCC/Clang-specific keywords, #pragma with compiler-specific directives, or other vendor-prefixed identifiers). Therefore there are no code fragments to report for investigation under Rule 1.2."
