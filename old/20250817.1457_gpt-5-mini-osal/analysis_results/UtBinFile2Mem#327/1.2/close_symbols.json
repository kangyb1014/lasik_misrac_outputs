  "explanation": "To determine whether UtBinFile2Mem uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions of all non-builtin symbols and types the function relies on: \n\n- bool: Could be from <stdbool.h> (standard) or a compiler/project extension/alias. Need its declaration to verify standard usage.\n- uint32: Likely a typedef (e.g. uint32_t or a project-specific alias). Its origin decides if a non\u2011standard/extended integer type is used.\n- FILE: The file-stream type is from the C standard library. Confirming its definition/prototype rules out a non\u2011standard replacement.\n- fopen, fread, fclose: Their prototypes determine whether standard signatures are used (standard C) or some non\u2011standard/extended variants are present.\n- strerror: Declaration is needed to ensure standard behavior and that its use doesn't rely on an extension.\n- errno: errno can be a macro that expands to thread-local or compiler\u2011specific construct; inspect its definition to ensure no language extension is being relied upon.\n- size_t: fread uses size_t in its prototype; checking this type ensures no non\u2011standard size type is involved in the call.\n- UtAssert_Failed: Project assertion function called in the else branch \u2014 its signature/implementation must be checked in case it uses compiler extensions (variadic macros, nonstandard attributes, etc.) that would affect the call site or require special language features.\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Static call graph shows this symbol related to the assertion infrastructure; its definition may reveal use of language extensions (thread-local storage, compiler attributes, inline assembly, etc.) that are reachable from the target function via the assertion call.\n\nCollecting these symbols (or their header/implementation files) lets the analyst determine if any language/compiler extensions are being used directly by UtBinFile2Mem or indirectly via the types and functions it references."
