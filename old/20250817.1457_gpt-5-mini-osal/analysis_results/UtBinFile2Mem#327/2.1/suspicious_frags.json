  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains no obvious statically unreachable statements (the fopen check, the fread check, the fclose call and the Success variable assignment are all reachable under normal control flow). There are no unreachable labels, statements after an unconditional return within the same block, or dead-code blocks in the shown function body. The only potential source of unreachable code is the assertion infrastructure: if UtAssert_Failed (via UtAssertEx) does not return (e.g. it aborts, longjmps, or otherwise transfers control out), then code following its invocation (notably the function return and any subsequent statements) may be unreachable on that execution path. Therefore the UtAssert_Failed invocation and its macro/related context accessor should be investigated to determine whether they are non-returning and thus create unreachable code. All other fragments in the provided function are reachable and do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the supplied code."
