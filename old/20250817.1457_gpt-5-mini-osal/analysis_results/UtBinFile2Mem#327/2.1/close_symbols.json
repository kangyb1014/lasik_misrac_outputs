  "explanation": "- fopen: The if-condition uses its return value to decide which branch executes. To determine if the \"else\" or the \"then\" branch (and any code after them) can ever be unreachable we must know the semantics/possible return values of fopen (and whether it can be modeled as always-successful or always-failing in this build).\\n- fread: The inner if compares fread(...) == 1. Knowing fread's return behavior (including whether it can be guaranteed to return 1 or never return 1 in this environment) is necessary to decide whether the Success=true assignment and any code that depends on that branch are reachable.\\n- fclose: Although unlikely to affect reachability, fclose is called unconditionally in the \"then\" branch; if fclose were a macro or function with non\u2011local control flow (e.g. longjmp/exit/noreturn in this project), that could make subsequent code unreachable. Its definition must be known.\\n- UtAssert_Failed: This call is in the \"else\" branch. UtAssert_Failed may be a macro or function that does not return (noreturn), or that performs longjmp/exit, or it may return normally. The determination of reachability for any code after the call (and whether the else branch itself contains unreachable statements) depends on its exact definition/attributes.\\n- UtAssert_GetContext: The static call graph shows UtAssert_GetContext is involved with the project assert machinery; UtAssert_Failed may expand to or call UtAssert_GetContext. The definition/behavior of UtAssert_GetContext (and its interaction with UtAssert_Failed) can affect control flow and must be known.\\n- strerror: UtAssert_Failed is invoked with strerror(errno) as an argument. If strerror is implemented as a macro or function with side effects or non\u2011local control flow in this code base, that could affect reachability; at minimum, its presence is needed to fully model the call expression passed into UtAssert_Failed.\\n- errno: errno is read to build the message passed to UtAssert_Failed. If errno is a macro or function with side effects, or if its access triggers special behavior in this environment, that could affect whether the else expression is well\u2011formed or reachable.\\n\\nIn short: to decide whether any branch or statement in UtBinFile2Mem is statically unreachable you must know the actual definitions and control\u2011flow properties (return behavior, attributes like noreturn, or use of longjmp/exit) of the above functions/objects (especially UtAssert_Failed and UtAssert_GetContext)."
