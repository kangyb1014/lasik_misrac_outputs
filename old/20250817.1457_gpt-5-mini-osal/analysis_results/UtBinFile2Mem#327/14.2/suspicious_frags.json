First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-statements are present in the provided target function UtBinFile2Mem, nor in the additional macro/function fragments shown. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for loops (their three clauses and loop-counter usage). Since there are no for loops in:\n- the body of UtBinFile2Mem (only calls to fopen, fread, fclose and a macro invocation),\n- the UtAssert_Failed macro definition shown (expands to a function call, not a for),\n- the UtAssert_GetContext function (simple return),\n- the uint32 typedef,\nthere is nothing in the supplied code that could violate Rule 14.2 and therefore no fragments require further investigation under that rule. Note: standard library functions (fopen, fread, fclose) and any unshown definitions of UtAssertEx were not provided; those would need inspection only if their source is in-scope and suspected to contain for loops, but based on the supplied code there are no in-scope for-loops to analyze."
