  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: Filename is already declared as const char * so it is const-qualified; the mode argument \"r\" is a string literal (effectively const char[]); the standard I/O functions fopen/fclose/fread have library-mandated prototypes that require non-const FILE * and non-const data pointers for write/read operations, so changing those pointed-to types to const would be incompatible with the API; the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros and UtAssert_GetContext related symbols are not pointer targets needing const-qualification. Therefore the remaining code fragments do not appear to be candidates for applying a const-qualified pointee under Rule 8.13."
