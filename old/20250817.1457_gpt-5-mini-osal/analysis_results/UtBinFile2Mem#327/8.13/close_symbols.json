  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C 'pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible' analysis:\n\n- FILE: Needed to understand the stdio stream type used by fopen/fread/fclose and to match those prototypes.\n\n- fopen: Its prototype (FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode)) shows that the filename parameter is const char *; this verifies that the function's const qualification on Filename is appropriate.\n\n- fread: Its prototype (size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)) is required to determine that the first argument is void * (non-const) and that fread writes into the buffer. This justifies Memory being non-const in the target function.\n\n- fclose: Prototype needed to confirm usage and ensure no const-related issues arise from closing the stream.\n\n- strerror: Prototype (char *strerror(int errnum) or const char * depending on platform) is required to determine the constness of the returned string passed to UtAssert_Failed and whether that should be const-qualified.\n\n- errno: The errno symbol (int) is required because it is passed to strerror; knowing errno's type/context confirms correct usage but is mainly included to resolve strerror usage.\n\n- UtAssert_Failed: Declaration/signature of this project assert function (format string and argument types) is required to know whether its %s parameter expects const char * or char * and whether passing strerror(errno) violates const qualifications.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Present in the static call graph; include its declaration because UtAssert_Failed may use it (macro/inline) and it can affect how UtAssert_Failed is implemented or typed with regard to constness.\n\n- bool: Definition (likely from <stdbool.h> or project typedef) is needed to verify the return type and ensure no const qualification issues with boolean return (context for MISRA rule checking of pointer parameters vs return type).\n\n- uint32: The typedef for uint32 is required to confirm the Length parameter type and to check interactions with fread's size_t parameters (const qualification is not directly about integer types but needed for correct prototype matching).\n\n- size_t: Included because it appears in fread's prototype; needed to match Length/size arguments and confirm that the buffer pointer passed to fread is non-const (fread uses void *), supporting the justification for Memory being non-const.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer confirm whether Memory and Filename are correctly const-qualified (Filename is const char *, Memory must be non-const because fread writes to it), and check whether passing strerror(errno) and the UtAssert_Failed usage involve any const-qualification mismatches."
