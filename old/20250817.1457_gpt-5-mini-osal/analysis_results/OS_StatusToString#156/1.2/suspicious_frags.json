  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The following are standard C constructs and do not constitute compiler extensions:\n- The typedef of an array (typedef char os_status_string_t[OS_STATUS_STRING_LENGTH]) and the function parameter os_status_string_t *status_string (a pointer to an array type) are valid standard-C usages.\n- Use of static inline for OS_StatusToInteger is standard (C99 and later).\n- Casting (long)Status and using snprintf with the \"%ld\" format specifier to match a long are standard C operations (the cast ensures the type matches the format specifier).\n- sizeof(*status_string) applied to the dereferenced array pointer yields the array size and is standard C behavior.\n\nNo identifiers or tokens associated with common compiler extensions were found (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
