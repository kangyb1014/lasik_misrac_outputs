  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library string-handling functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in the provided code (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The function uses snprintf (from <stdio.h>), which is outside the scope of Rule 21.17. Additionally, the pointer parameter is null-checked (status_string != NULL) and sizeof(*status_string) is used to limit the snprintf write to the known array size (os_status_string_t is defined as char[OS_STATUS_STRING_LENGTH]), and OS_StatusToInteger returns a long matching the \"%ld\" format. For these reasons there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
