Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_StatusToString:\n```c\nchar *OS_StatusToString(osal_status_t status, os_status_string_t *status_string)\n{\n    char *string = NULL;\n\n    if (status_string != NULL)\n    {\n        snprintf(*status_string, sizeof(*status_string), \"%ld\", OS_StatusToInteger(status));\n        string = *status_string;\n    }\n    return string;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_StatusToString:\nstatic inline long OS_StatusToInteger(osal_status_t Status)\n{\n    return (long)Status;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstring = *status_string;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment string = *status_string; stores the pointer to the buffer written by snprintf so that the function can return that pointer. Removing this assignment would change the observable behaviour (the function would return NULL instead of a pointer to the formatted string), so the statement is not dead code."
