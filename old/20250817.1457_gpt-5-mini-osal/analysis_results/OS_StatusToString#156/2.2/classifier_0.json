  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_StatusToString:\n```c\nchar *OS_StatusToString(osal_status_t status, os_status_string_t *status_string)\n{\n    char *string = NULL;\n\n    if (status_string != NULL)\n    {\n        snprintf(*status_string, sizeof(*status_string), \"%ld\", OS_StatusToInteger(status));\n        string = *status_string;\n    }\n    return string;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_StatusToString:\nstatic inline long OS_StatusToInteger(osal_status_t Status)\n{\n    return (long)Status;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nchar *string = NULL;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the initialization char *string = NULL; is not dead code. It sets the return value for the path where status_string == NULL and prevents returning an indeterminate value (undefined behaviour). Removing this initialization would change program behaviour for that path. Note 3 of Rule 2.2 also states that initialization is not the same as an assignment and is not a candidate for dead code."
