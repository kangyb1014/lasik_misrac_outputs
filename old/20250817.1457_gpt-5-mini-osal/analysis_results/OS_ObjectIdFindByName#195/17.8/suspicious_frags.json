  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.8: - The assignment '*object_id = token.obj_id;' modifies the object referenced by the pointer parameter, which is explicitly allowed by the rule (the pointer itself is not reassigned). - OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token); and usage of the local variable 'token' operate on a local object (address passed is not a function parameter), so no parameter pointer is being reassigned. - The parameter 'idtype' is passed by value and not modified in this function. - The function signature declares 'name' as 'const char *', and there is no code in this function that reassigns the 'name' parameter. - Variable declarations and the return statement do not modify any function parameter. The three reported lines are included because the ARGCHECK/LENGTHCHECK macros and the call to OS_ObjectIdGetByName could hide code that reassigns a parameter pointer (e.g. via macro expansion or mismatched/non-const API), so they warrant inspection."
