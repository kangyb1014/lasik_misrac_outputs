  "explanation": "I scanned the provided function and related definitions for any compiler-specific language extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__/asm, __extension__, typeof/__typeof__, GNU statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other documented compiler extensions). None of those appear in the target code. The constructs present are standard C (function definitions, macros, typedefs, casts, memchr usage, forward struct typedef). The custom integer/type names (int32, uint32, osal_id_t, osal_objtype_t) are project typedefs and not compiler extensions; their definitions should be checked only if they themselves use compiler-specific features, but no such evidence is present in the shown code. The ARGCHECK macro text as shown contains a spacing anomaly (returnerrcode) which appears to be a formatting/typo issue rather than a language extension. For these reasons there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
