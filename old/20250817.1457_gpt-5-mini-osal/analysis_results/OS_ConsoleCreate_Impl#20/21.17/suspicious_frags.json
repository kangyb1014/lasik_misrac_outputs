  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions are present in this function (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The code performs semaphore operations (sem_init/sem_destroy), thread creation (OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl), and uses a union/struct initializer (local_arg = {0}) \u2014 none of these are direct uses of the string handling APIs covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. There is also no pointer arithmetic or raw buffer manipulation in this fragment that would indicate a risk of out-of-bounds string accesses. Note: if callers or the implementations of the invoked functions (for example OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl or OS_ConsoleTask_Entry) use string.h functions, those implementations should be inspected separately; however, within this function there are no string.h usages to investigate."
