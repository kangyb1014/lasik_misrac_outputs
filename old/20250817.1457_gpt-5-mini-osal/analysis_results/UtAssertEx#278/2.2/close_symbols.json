  "explanation": "For determining whether any operations in UtAssertEx are dead (removal would not affect program behaviour) you must know the definitions and uses of the globals/funcs it touches and the routines that read those globals or depend on the same locking/timing. Brief reasons by symbol:\n\n- UT_SegmentCounters: definition (fields TotalTestCases, CaseCount[]) and qualifiers (e.g. volatile) are required to know whether the increments/reads in UtAssertEx have observable effects elsewhere.\n- UT_TotalCounters: its TestSegmentCount field is used to compute TestSegmentCount; need its definition/uses to see if that computation is observable.\n- UtAssert_CaseType_t: enum/typedef defines valid values and range; required to determine if the CaseType assignment/array index can be optimized away (i.e. always one value).\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_PASS: value of the PASS constant is needed to see whether the assignment when Expression is true changes behaviour.\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX: value of MAX is needed to determine if the conditional that increments CaseCount can ever be true (or always false) \u2014 key to dead-code analysis of that increment.\n- CurrentSegment: global passed to the report; its definition/uses determine whether computing/passing it (and associated reads) has observable effect.\n- UtAssert_DoReport: full implementation is required because it consumes TestSegmentCount, TotalTestCases, CaseType, CurrentSegment and FinalMessage \u2014 removing/altering the call could change behaviour; you must inspect what DoReport does with those values.\n- UT_BSP_Lock / UT_BSP_Unlock: their semantics (and whether they affect timing/atomicity or have side effects) matter because Note 1 (timing) and concurrency can make increments/reads observable. Their declarations/implementations must be inspected.\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl / OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl: underlying implementations called by the BSP lock/unlock may introduce side effects or ordering constraints (interrupt masking, scheduling) that affect whether removing the lock/unlock calls is behaviour-preserving.\n- UT_BSP_DoText: used by UtAssert_DoReport (per call graph); DoReport\u2019s behaviour may depend on DoText \u2014 need it to see observable outputs (text output is an observable behaviour).\n- UtAssert_BeginTest, UtAssert_EndTest, UtTest_AddCommon, UtTest_Run, UT_BSP_EndTest: these other test-related functions (appearing as callers of lock/unlock and present in the same subsystem) may read the counters or rely on their values/timing; include them so you can determine whether modifying/removing the counter updates or related calls in UtAssertEx would change program behaviour.\n\nIn short: to decide if any increment/assignment/call in UtAssertEx is dead you must examine the data definitions (counters, enums, globals), the report function that consumes those values, and the locking/timing primitives and other test routines that read or depend on the same state. The listed symbols are the minimal set to inspect for that judgment."
