Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "To determine whether UtAssertEx (and the functions it invokes) contains any for-loops that violate the MISRA \"for loop shall be well-formed\" rule we must examine the bodies of every function called (directly and transitively) from UtAssertEx and any objects those functions read or modify that could participate in loop control. The required symbols and why they are needed:\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock: direct callee of UtAssertEx. Its implementation may contain for-loops (or call others that do); those loops must be checked for well-formedness and side effects.\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl: transitive callee of UT_BSP_Lock. Include to inspect its body for for-loops or modifications of shared objects used as loop counters/control flags.\n- UT_BSP_Unlock: direct callee of UtAssertEx. Inspect for loops or calls it makes that could affect loop well-formedness.\n- OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl: transitive callee of UT_BSP_Unlock. Inspect its implementation for for-loops or side effects on shared objects.\n- UtAssert_DoReport: direct callee of UtAssertEx. Its body (and any for-loops within) form part of the behavior of UtAssertEx and must be checked.\n- UT_BSP_DoText: transitive callee (called by UtAssert_DoReport). Include to inspect any for-loops and side effects it performs.\n\nAdditionally, the following global symbols / types used by UtAssertEx must be known because they are read and/or written in UtAssertEx and could be referenced/modified by the called functions (affecting loop-control correctness):\n\n- UT_SegmentCounters: structure/variable updated (CaseCount[], TotalTestCases). If any called function contains a for-loop that uses or modifies these members as loop counters or side-effected objects, that could create a MISRA violation.\n- UT_TotalCounters: (specifically UT_TotalCounters.TestSegmentCount) read to compute TestSegmentCount. If callees modify this object inside loop bodies, you must know its definition and usages.\n- CurrentSegment: passed to UtAssert_DoReport. If any called function's loops use/modify this object, its definition is needed to determine correctness.\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX: constant/macros used in the conditional that indexes CaseCount; needed to understand valid indexing and whether any loop in callees depends on or modifies related ranges.\n- UtAssert_CaseType_t: typedef/enum for CaseType. Needed to establish its range/representation (signed/unsigned) to check casts and any loop counters derived from it.\n- uint32: typedef for integer width and signedness. Needed when reasoning about casts, loop counters and whether increments/wraparound in loops create side effects relevant to rule clauses.\n\n(We did not include standard library helpers like vsnprintf/va_start/va_end because they are unlikely to be part of the codebase's MISRA-relevant for-loops in this project; if your analysis scope requires checking standard-library implementations as well, add those symbols.)"
