  "explanation": "I inspected the target function and the related definitions. I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions that are commonly documented as extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), Microsoft __stdcall/__fastcall, GNU __inline__ keyword, GCC nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords). The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET uses only standard C operators (&, []), and its use with *token expands to a standard address-of of an lvalue; that is not a language extension. The helper OS_strnlen is declared as \"static inline\" which is standard in C99 and later (not a vendor extension in those standards). All casts, pointer arithmetic, sizeof, strncmp, memchr, and array indexing are standard C. Therefore there are no code fragments that explicitly use compiler-documented language extensions to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
