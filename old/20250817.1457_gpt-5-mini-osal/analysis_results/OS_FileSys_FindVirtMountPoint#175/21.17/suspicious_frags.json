  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 21.17: \n\n- The call to OS_strnlen(filesys->virtual_mountpt, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt)) operates on the in-structure array filesys->virtual_mountpt with an explicit sizeof bound, so the underlying memchr (used in OS_strnlen) is limited to the actual array size and does not by itself read beyond that object. The subsequent check that mplen >= sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) also prevents using a length that would imply the array lacked a terminator. \n\n- The flag test, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET access, and the sizeof-based checks are not string.h usage and do not themselves cause accesses beyond object bounds. \n\nThe principal concerns are where standard string functions or direct indexing might read bytes from the external pointer 'target' without ensuring that 'target' provides at least that many accessible bytes; those uses are listed in suspicious_frags above and should be investigated further."
