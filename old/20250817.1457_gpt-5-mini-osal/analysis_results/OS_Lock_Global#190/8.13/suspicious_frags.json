  "explanation": "No pointer usages in this function appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer objects in the function are:\n\n- The function parameter OS_object_token_t *token: the function writes to token->lock_key.key_value (and assigns token->lock_key into objtype->owner_key), so the pointee is intentionally modified. Making the pointer point to const would prevent these legitimate writes.\n\n- The local pointer OS_objtype_state_t *objtype: this is set to &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type] and is used to modify objtype->transaction_count and objtype->owner_key. These modifications require a non-const pointee.\n\n- The global array OS_objtype_state is non-const and is intended to be mutable (transaction_count and owner_key are updated); taking its element address to a non-const pointer is appropriate.\n\nOther identifiers (OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED, OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE, OS_ObjectIdToInteger, OS_ObjectIdIsValid, OS_Lock_Global_Impl, OS_DEBUG, etc.) are not pointer declarations that could be const-qualified here. No pointer variables exist that are only read and could safely be changed to point to const-qualified types. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to report for investigation under Rule 8.13."
