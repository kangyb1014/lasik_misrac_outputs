  "explanation": "All other code fragments in the provided function use standard, portable C language constructs (assignments, bitwise operations, casts, pointer dereferencing, array indexing, increments, conditional statements, function calls, and formatted debug calls). None of these are compiler-specific language extensions. The use of macros, integer literals (hex), and casted printf-style arguments are normal C usage. The array declaration and struct field accesses are standard. The only construct that may be a compiler-specific extension on some toolchains is the compound literal ((osal_id_t){0xFFFFFFFF}) used in the OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED macro; therefore that macro and its use are reported for investigation. If the project is strictly limited to C89/90, compound literals (a C99 feature) could be considered a deviation \u2014 otherwise they are standard C and not an extension. No other constructs in the shown code require further investigation for language-extension usage."
