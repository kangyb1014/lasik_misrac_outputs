  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No fragments modify the parameter variable token itself (e.g., there is no assignment such as token = ... or pointer arithmetic on token). All writes involving the parameter are to the object it points to (e.g., token->lock_key.key_value = ...), which is permitted by the rule. Other modifications are to local variables (self_task_id, objtype) or to the object referenced by objtype; these are not modifications of the function parameter. Reads of token->obj_type and token->lock_mode are also only reads. Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
