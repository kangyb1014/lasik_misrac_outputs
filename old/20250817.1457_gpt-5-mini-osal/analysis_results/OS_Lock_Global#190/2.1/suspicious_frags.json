  "explanation": "I have listed all code fragments from the provided source and related definitions that warrant inspection for possible unreachable-code issues under MISRA C Rule 2.1. I did not mark other parts of the function for investigation because:\n\n- The outer conditional (token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER && token->lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE) and the inner owner_key check both depend on runtime values (token fields and mutable objtype state). With only the supplied static definitions, these branches cannot be proven always true or always false, so the contained statements are not provably unreachable and therefore were not flagged.\n\n- Calls to external/runtime functions (OS_TaskGetId_Impl, OS_ObjectIdIsValid, OS_ObjectIdToInteger) may return different values at runtime; without their implementations or guarantees, their results cannot be used to prove any branch unreachable.\n\n- Array indexing is guarded by the token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER test, so accessing OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type] is not statically provably out-of-bounds and is therefore not marked.\n\n- The assignments and increments that depend on runtime state (e.g., objtype->transaction_count increment, objtype->owner_key update) are reachable under plausible runtime conditions and thus were not flagged as unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can expand the investigation to focus on proving reachability/unreachability given additional information (e.g., definitions/behaviour of OS_TaskGetId_Impl, OS_ObjectIdIsValid, initialization state of OS_objtype_state[], or build-time macro configurations that affect OS_DEBUG)."
