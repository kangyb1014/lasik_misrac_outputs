  "scenario": "No violation: the empty macro definition (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)) merely removes debug-call statements at preprocessing, leaving empty statements or empty blocks but not code that can never be executed. It does not introduce unreachable code in the shown OS_Lock_Global function. (A true violation would look like code placed after a guaranteed return or infinite loop, e.g. 'return; /* ...unreachable code... */')"
