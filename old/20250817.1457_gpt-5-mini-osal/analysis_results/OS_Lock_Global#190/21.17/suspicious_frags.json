  "explanation": "I found no uses of the standard <string.h> functions named in the rule (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) or other string-handling calls that take caller-supplied pointer/buffer parameters in the provided code. The only related call is strerror(ret) inside OS_Lock_Global_Impl, but strerror does not take a caller-supplied buffer pointer parameter (it returns a pointer to an implementation-provided message or uses other mechanisms) and therefore is outside the specific scope of Rule 21.17 as stated. Also, OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro here, so any format-string usages guarded by it do not introduce runtime calls to string.h functions in the given compilation. No other fragments pass caller-owned pointer arguments to string.h functions, so there are no code fragments in this submission that need further investigation for Rule 21.17."
