  "explanation": "For checking potential violations of the <string.h> bounds rule you must know whether any string-handling call could be reached from this function and whether any buffers/pointers passed to such calls could be out-of-bounds. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - The full struct definition for 'token' is needed to see whether it contains character arrays or pointers that could be passed to string functions (e.g. name fields, char* members). Also needed to know the types/layout of token->lock_key and token->obj_type/lock_mode members.\n\n- OS_objtype_state_t\n  - The struct definition for the per-object-type state is required to determine whether it contains any buffers/strings or pointer fields (and their sizes) that could be subject to string.h operations.\n\n- OS_objtype_state\n  - The global array/instance referenced by &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type] must be inspected to know actual storage, bounds, and any embedded buffers that callees might operate on.\n\n- (type of lock_key / owner_key and their key_value field)\n  - The concrete type and size of the lock_key/owner_key and of key_value are required to ensure the assignment and comparisons do not rely on underlying string operations or overlapping memory that could interact with string functions. (Include the typedef/name used in the code so the analyst can inspect it.)\n\n- OS_Lock_Global_Impl\n  - This callee is invoked while holding/establishing the lock. Its implementation must be inspected because it may call string.h functions using pointers derived from 'token' or 'objtype'. If so, that would affect whether the overall operation can cause out-of-bounds string accesses.\n\n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl\n  - Called to get self_task_id. Its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not return or manipulate string/buffer pointers referenced later, or otherwise call string functions with pointers from this context.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid\n  - Used to decide task id handling. Its implementation might inspect or convert object id structures that contain strings or buffers; it should be checked for any string.h usage on pointers derived from this function's inputs.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdToInteger\n  - Converts object id to integer. Although it returns an integer, its implementation should be checked to ensure it does not perform any string operations on object id structures that might rely on pointers from this function.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - The debug logging macro/function is called with formatted strings and token/objtype values. Inspecting its implementation is necessary in case it invokes string functions (e.g. sprintf/strcpy) on data derived from token/objtype.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE and OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED\n  - These macros/constants affect construction of key_value and may indicate special values or encodings; while not string functions themselves, their definitions may reveal casting or macro expansions that touch memory representations. Include them to ensure no hidden use of string functions or pointer aliasing occurs via macros.\n\nIn short: get the definitions/implementations of the token and objtype types and globals, the lock-key type, and the listed callees/macros. These let an analyst determine whether any string.h calls are reachable from OS_Lock_Global and whether any buffers passed to such calls could be accessed out-of-bounds."
