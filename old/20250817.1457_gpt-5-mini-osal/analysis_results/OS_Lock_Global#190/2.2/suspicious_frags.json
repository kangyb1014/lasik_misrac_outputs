  "explanation": "The fragments above are flagged because they perform state tracking or logging actions that could be redundant or unused depending on run-time context (e.g. reserved-task assignment, transaction counter increment, owner-key checks, and debug prints). Other parts of the function are not flagged because they are required for observable program behaviour or are clear control-flow/essential operations: - The function signature, local variable declarations, and the initial guard (if (token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER && token->lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)) implement the call precondition and are necessary to decide whether locking should occur. Removing them would change behaviour. - The lookup of objtype (objtype = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type];) is required to access shared state and cannot be removed without affecting behaviour. - The call to OS_TaskGetId_Impl() is an observable query of the execution context; its removal would change behaviour. - The call to OS_Lock_Global_Impl(token->obj_type) is the core lock operation; removing it would obviously change program behaviour. - The assignments to token->lock_key and objtype->owner_key (the latter is included in the suspicious list only for the conditional branch) are included above where potentially redundant; other direct assignments and the control flow that ensures exclusive access are integral to the locking protocol. - Comments and explanatory text are not executable and thus not candidates for dead code under Rule 2.2. In summary, the selected fragments are the plausible candidates for investigation; the remaining statements implement essential control flow, state access, or locking primitives and therefore are unlikely to be dead code without further system-wide analysis."
