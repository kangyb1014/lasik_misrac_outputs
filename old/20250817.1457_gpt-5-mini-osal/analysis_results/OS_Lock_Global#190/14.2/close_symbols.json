Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must know whether any for\u2011loop behaviour could arise from this function or from functions/macros it invokes, and whether objects modified here could be loop counters or loop control flags used elsewhere in a for statement. The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- OS_TaskGetId_Impl: the full function body is needed because the behaviour of functions called in a for statement is part of the loop body. If this function contains a for loop or modifies objects used as loop counters/flags, that could affect conformance.\n- OS_Lock_Global_Impl: same rationale \u2014 its implementation may contain loops or modify objects that would count as loop counters/flags.\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid: its implementation may contain loops or have side effects; also its return semantics determine how the token and self_task_id are treated.\n- OS_ObjectIdToInteger: its implementation and return type are needed to understand conversions and whether it has side effects or uses/modifies objects relevant to loop rules.\n- OS_DEBUG: this macro/function could expand to code that contains loops or side effects; its expansion must be inspected to rule out loop-related violations.\n- OS_object_token_t (definition): the structure layout (fields obj_type, lock_mode, lock_key, etc.) is needed to know which objects are read/modified here and whether any of them could be used as a loop counter or control flag elsewhere.\n- OS_objtype_state (definition): the struct fields (transaction_count, owner_key, etc.) and their types are required because transaction_count is modified here and owner_key/lock_key are assigned \u2014 these are candidates for loop counters/flags and must be checked.\n- OS_objtype_state (global array): the storage and linkage of this global object must be known (e.g., volatile, external linkage) because a for loop elsewhere might reference this same object as its counter or flag; also to inspect any initializers or attributes that could include loops.\n- token->lock_key / objtype->owner_key type (struct with member key_value): the exact type and semantics of the key_value member are needed to determine whether assignments/modifications here affect potential for\u2011loop counters or are performed via functions/macros that contain loops.\n- osal_id_t (typedef): the underlying integer or pointer type (and any qualifiers) is required because self_task_id is used and converted; if the type has special attributes that affect side effects or aliasing, that matters for loop analysis.\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE: the constant value and any macros used to compute lock_key.key_value must be known to ensure no hidden side effects or function\u2011like macros that include loops.\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: needed to understand the conditional (token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER) \u2014 whether this macro expands to an expression or invokes something with side effects.\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: needed to know the conditional on token->lock_mode and whether the macro has any side effects.\n- OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED: value assigned to self_task_id when invalid \u2014 needed to check whether this assignment can affect loop counters/flags.\n\nIn short: include the bodies/definitions of all callees and any types/macros that are read or written in this function because MISRA's for\u2011loop rule treats the behaviour of called functions and macro expansions as part of loop body behaviour and prohibits modification of loop counters/flags by those behaviours."
