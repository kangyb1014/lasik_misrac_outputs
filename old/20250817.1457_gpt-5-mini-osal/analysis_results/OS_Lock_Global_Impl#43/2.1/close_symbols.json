  "explanation": "To decide whether any of the conditional branches in OS_Lock_Global_Impl are statically unreachable you must know whether the conditions can ever evaluate both true and false at runtime. Specifically:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (definition and where it is initialized/populated): The outer if() tests impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype] != NULL. You need the table definition and its initial contents (and whether entries can be NULL) to determine if the impl==NULL branch can ever occur.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t (struct definition, including the 'mutex' member type): Understanding the structure is needed to know the member accessed (impl->mutex) and its type; this is required to reason about whether calling pthread_mutex_lock on that member is valid or can be optimized away as unreachable.\n\n- osal_objtype_t (type definition and valid value range / enum): The index used into the table is idtype. You must know the domain of osal_objtype_t (allowed values, any validation) to determine which table entries are actually accessed and whether some indices are impossible (making the NULL check always true/false or causing undefined behavior).\n\n- Code that initializes/allocates OS_impl_objtype_lock_table entries (module(s)/function(s) that populate the table): Static initialization alone may not show runtime changes. The code that fills or registers entries is required to determine if entries can remain NULL for any legitimate idtype at runtime.\n\n- OS_Lock_Global (caller implementation): The caller may validate or transform idtype before calling OS_Lock_Global_Impl (for example ensuring a valid idtype or ensuring the table entry exists). Inspecting the caller can prove the impl!=NULL check always/never holds when called from actual callsites.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock (prototype and documented return-value semantics): The inner if(ret != 0) depends on possible return codes from pthread_mutex_lock. You must know whether pthread_mutex_lock can legally return a non-zero value for a correctly-initialized mutex in this system (or whether wrappers/porting layers change semantics). If pthread_mutex_lock can never return non-zero here, that branch would be unreachable.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t (type and initialization semantics for impl->mutex): If the mutex is guaranteed to be properly initialized and pthread_mutex_lock on such a mutex cannot fail in this environment, the ret!=0 branch may be unreachable. Conversely, if mutex initialization can fail or be uninitialized, the branch may be reachable.\n\nThese symbols (definitions and initialization sites) are the minimal set required to determine whether either the outer 'if (impl != NULL)' or the inner 'if (ret != 0)' branches are provably always or never taken (i.e., statically unreachable) under the project's runtime and initialization model."
