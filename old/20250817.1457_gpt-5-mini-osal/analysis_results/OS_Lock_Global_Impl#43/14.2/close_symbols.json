The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA-C for\u2011loop well-formedness rule in OS_Lock_Global_Impl:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table\n  - The function reads this global with indexing (OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]). We must inspect its definition to ensure the identifier is not a macro or accessor that expands to code containing a for loop or persistent side effects (which would matter if any loop were present or if indexing hides loop-like behaviour).\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t\n  - The concrete type of the pointer returned by the table must be inspected to ensure that accessing its members (impl->...) does not invoke macros or inline functions that contain for loops or modify loop counters/objects. Also to understand whether the type or its accessors introduce side effects.\n\n- osal_objtype_t\n  - The index parameter type; check its definition to ensure indexing the table has no hidden side effects (e.g. unusual macro casts or overloaded constructs in project headers) and that using it as an index is benign with respect to loop\u2011control rules.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t::mutex\n  - The specific member accessed (&impl->mutex) must be examined to determine its actual type and whether the member access expands to code (macro or accessor) or the member itself is some wrapper type that could embed loops or side effects. This is necessary because the MISRA rule treats behaviour of called/expanded code as part of loop bodies.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t\n  - If impl->mutex is a pthread_mutex_t or wrapper thereof, inspect its typedef/definition to ensure it is a plain object and that taking its address (&impl->mutex) is not a macro expanding to code with loops. Also useful if pthread-related inline wrappers are used in this project.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock\n  - This function is called from the target. To determine whether the target contains any for-loop behaviour via called code, pthread_mutex_lock must be checked to see if it is implemented as a macro/inline that contains for loops or side effects relevant to MISRA loop rules. Even if it's an external library, the project may provide wrappers or macros that need inspection.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - OS_DEBUG may be a macro or function. If it is a macro it might expand into code that contains for loops (e.g. formatted logging expansion) or modify objects; this must be inspected because macros expand into the caller context and their code counts toward the body behaviour when considering loop rules.\n\n- strerror\n  - This function is called inside OS_DEBUG/used to format the debug string. If strerror is a macro or project-supplied wrapper (rather than the standard library function), it could contain for loops or side effects that must be considered as part of the calling context.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule under check requires that any for-loop body includes the behaviour of functions/macros called within that statement. While OS_Lock_Global_Impl itself contains no for statement, any macros or called functions invoked in its body (or hidden behind member access or indexing) could introduce for loops or violate the clause restrictions. The listed symbols cover the table/index access, the object and member types, and all functions/macros invoked directly so an auditor can inspect whether any of them expand/implement for loops or side effects relevant to the rule."
