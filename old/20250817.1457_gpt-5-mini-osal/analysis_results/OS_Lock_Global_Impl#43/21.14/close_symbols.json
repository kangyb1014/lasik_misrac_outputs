  "explanation": "For verifying the MISRA rule (memcmp must not be used to compare null\u2011terminated strings) you must inspect any functions/macros and data referenced by OS_Lock_Global_Impl because the target function itself does not call memcmp but it calls/uses other symbols that could hide such a violation:\n\n- OS_DEBUG: This macro/function is used to format and output the strerror() result (\"%s\"). Its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare or handle null\u2011terminated strings.\n- strerror: Returns a null\u2011terminated string for the error code. Although part of the C library, if the project provides its own strerror wrapper/implementation it must be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings.\n- pthread_mutex_lock: Included because the code checks its return value and passes that to strerror/OS_DEBUG. If the project provides a wrapper around pthread_mutex_lock (or a mocked implementation) that does additional string handling, that wrapper must be inspected.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: Global data referenced by the function. Its definition or any accessor macros could contain string comparisons; inspect its declaration/definition to be sure no memcmp usage is hidden there.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The struct type of the table entries (impl). Its definition must be examined for embedded methods/macros or inline functions that might perform string comparisons using memcmp.\n\nInspecting the implementations/definitions of these symbols is sufficient to determine whether any memcmp usage comparing null\u2011terminated strings is reachable from OS_Lock_Global_Impl."
