  "explanation": "For determining whether OS_Lock_Global_Impl contains dead code (i.e., its removal would not affect program behaviour) the analyzer must know whether the body can ever have an observable effect and whether the function is ever meaningfully invoked. Explanation of required symbols:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The function reads this global table to get 'impl'. Need the definition, size and runtime initialization to know whether entries are ever non-NULL (if always NULL the body is no-op and could be dead).\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The structure definition (fields and any side-effecting semantics) is required to know what impl->mutex represents and whether accessing it has observable effects beyond the mutex call.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock: The prototype and documented semantics (return values, side effects on locking state) are needed to determine whether calling it changes program behaviour (synchronization) and thus whether the call is essential.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t: The concrete type/semantics of impl->mutex are needed to confirm that pthread_mutex_lock operates on a normal mutex (and to reason about its observable synchronization effects).\n\n- OS_DEBUG: The logging macro/function used in the error path may be compiled out or be side-effecting; need its definition/configuration to know whether the debug call makes the function observable even when mutex locking fails.\n\n- strerror: Used to produce the debug message; its behaviour/availability affects whether the error path produces observable output.\n\n- osal_objtype_t: The type and legal range of idtype are needed to determine which index into OS_impl_objtype_lock_table is accessed and whether that access is meaningful (out-of-range, always the same index, etc.).\n\n- OS_Lock_Global: The immediate caller; its implementation is required to see when/how it calls OS_Lock_Global_Impl (conditional, unconditionally, reachable code paths). If the caller never invokes it in practice, the callee may be dead.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry: These are callers of OS_Lock_Global (per the call graph). Their implementations are needed to determine whether any call chain from application entry points reaches OS_Lock_Global_Impl (reachability analysis for dead-code determination).\n\n- Module initialization / functions that populate or modify OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: Any initializer or APIs that set entries in OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (module init routines, lock-creation/destruction functions) must be inspected to know whether impl can ever be non-NULL at runtime, and thus whether the mutex lock path can execute. If no code ever populates the table, the body is effectively dead.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine (a) whether OS_Lock_Global_Impl is ever called on a path executed by the program, (b) whether the impl lookup can ever produce a non-NULL effecting object, and (c) whether the calls inside (pthread_mutex_lock / OS_DEBUG) produce observable effects. That information is necessary to decide if removing OS_Lock_Global_Impl would change program behaviour (i.e., whether it is dead code)."
