  "explanation": "- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The declaration/definition of this global table may carry compiler-specific storage-class or attribute annotations (for example __attribute__((section(...))), visibility attributes, or other extensions). Inspecting its symbol is required to determine whether such extensions are used when the table is referenced.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The struct/typedef for this type must be examined because its definition may contain language extensions (GCC attributes on the struct or members, anonymous/unnamed members supported as an extension, packed/aligned attributes, inline assembly in members, or use of compiler-specific qualifiers).\n- osal_objtype_t: The index type used to access the table could be a typedef or enum that uses an extended underlying type or compiler-specific attributes (e.g., enum size extensions). Its definition is needed to ensure standard C types are used.\n- OS_DEBUG: This macro/function must be inspected because it is often a macro that can hide language extensions (variadic macros, statement-expressions using GCC ({ ... }), use of typeof, or other non-standard constructs). Determining whether OS_DEBUG is implemented with compiler extensions is essential for the MISRA check.\n- pthread_mutex_lock: The declaration (or wrapper/macro) for this function should be checked to ensure it is a normal function declaration and not a macro or inline wrapper that uses compiler extensions. Although POSIX, wrappers or platform headers may introduce extensions.\n- pthread_mutex_t: The type of impl->mutex must be checked: its definition (in pthread headers or platform-specific headers) could use compiler-specific extensions (special qualifiers or attributes) that would violate the rule.\n- strerror: The declaration/implementation may be a macro or variant that uses non-standard constructs on some platforms. Inspecting its symbol ensures no language-extension use is hidden in the call.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/declarations of the above symbols to detect any use of compiler-specific language extensions (attributes, statement-expressions, inline asm, non-standard qualifiers, variadic macro tricks, typeof, __extension__, etc.) that would violate the MISRA rule."
