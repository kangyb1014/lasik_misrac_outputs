  "explanation": "The selected fragments are those directly involved with pointer types to OS_impl_objtype_lock_t and their use. They should be inspected to determine whether the pointed-to type could/should be const-qualified. Other code fragments need not be investigated for Rule 8.13 because: (1) The pthread APIs (pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_cond_*) require mutable pthread_mutex_t / pthread_cond_t objects \u2014 therefore pointers used to operate on these members cannot be to const-qualified types. (2) The array is declared as an array of const pointers (OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *const ...), so the pointer-to-object constness (i.e., that the array elements themselves are const pointers) is already applied; only the pointed-to type could be const, but that would be incompatible with the pthread API usage. (3) The OS_DEBUG macro, the osal_objtype_t typedef, and the function signature do not affect whether the pointers should point to const-qualified types. Given the need to modify mutex/cond state, making the pointed-to OS_impl_objtype_lock_t const is likely not feasible; however, the above fragments should be reviewed to confirm that no pointer-to-object could be const-qualified without breaking required mutable operations."
