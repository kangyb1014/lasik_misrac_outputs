  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking MISRA rule about string.h functions:\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: needed to determine how the table is indexed and whether indexing by idtype can produce an out-of-bounds access or a malformed pointer that could later be used with string functions (defensive check even though target does not directly call string.h functions).\n\n- osal_objtype_t: to know the valid range/representation of idtype used to index OS_impl_objtype_lock_table; ensures the table access is defined and not producing an unexpected pointer that might be passed to any string handling routines.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: to inspect the structure fields (especially mutex) and confirm there are no hidden char buffers in the struct that might be used by logging or other string operations.\n\n- pthread_mutex_t (type of impl->mutex): to confirm the type of impl->mutex and that pthread_mutex_lock is being called with a valid mutex object (ensures no accidental misuse that could indirectly trigger logging with string operations).\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock (prototype/semantics): to understand its return value semantics (it returns an errno-style error number, not errno) so that passing its return value to strerror is correct; this matters because misuse of the returned value could lead to unexpected strings being produced.\n\n- strerror (prototype; <string.h>): this is the only string-related call visible (strerror(ret)). You must inspect its prototype/contract to confirm it does not take pointer parameters that could cause out-of-bounds accesses and to confirm the returned pointer's lifetime/ownership (usually pointer to static storage), which affects whether any subsequent string ops could overrun buffers.\n\n- OS_DEBUG (macro/implementation): the debug logging macro may format/copy the string returned by strerror into internal buffers. To determine compliance with the MISRA string rules you must inspect OS_DEBUG's implementation to see whether it uses safe formatting functions (e.g. bounded snprintf) or unsafe string functions (strcpy/strcat) that could access beyond destination bounds.\n\n- Formatting/back-end functions used by OS_DEBUG (e.g. vsnprintf, snprintf, printf, strcpy if used): if OS_DEBUG ultimately calls any of these standard functions, you need their usage sites to check for length/bounds handling. In particular, vsnprintf/snprintf usage with correct size parameters or the presence of unbounded strcpy/strcat/memcpy would determine whether the call to strerror could indirectly cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine whether any string.h routine (directly in this function or indirectly via logging) can access memory beyond the bounds of the objects passed to them, and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
