  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided UtSprintf implementation. Every statement in the function can be executed in normal operation: the static buffer and index are used at runtime, the pre-increment of TextIndex and the conditional reset (if (TextIndex >= UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS) TextIndex = 0;) are reachable (with UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS defined as 10 the branch is taken periodically), the variadic processing (va_start, vsnprintf, va_end) is executed on each call, and the return of Buf[TextIndex].Text is reachable. There are no constant-false or constant-true conditions, no early returns that make following code unreachable, and no code after a return. Therefore, with the provided definitions (UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS = 10, UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t and uint32 types), there is no unreachable code to investigate in this function. Note: if compile-time configuration elsewhere set UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS to 0 or UT_SNPRINTF_BUF_SIZE to 0, that would create other issues (e.g. zero-length arrays or invalid indexing) but those conditions are not present in the supplied code and, while they may produce undefined behavior, they do not create unreachable code within this function as shown."
