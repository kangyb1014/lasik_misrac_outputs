  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why it is required to decide if any code in UtSprintf is unreachable):\n\n- UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS\n  - The if-condition and the static array size depend on this macro/constant. Its value determines whether the branch (TextIndex >= UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS) can ever be true or false, and whether Buf has a valid (non-zero) number of elements. If it is 0 or 1 or a compile-time constant, certain paths or array accesses could be impossible or invalid, which affects reachability analysis.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t\n  - The definition of this type is required to understand what Buf[] contains and whether indexing Buf[TextIndex] is well-formed. The structure layout may also affect whether the sizeof expression is valid or constant.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t.Text (member and its array size)\n  - The code uses sizeof(Buf[TextIndex].Text) and passes Buf[TextIndex].Text to vsnprintf. Knowing whether Text is an array (and its size) is necessary to determine whether the vsnprintf call is well-formed and whether any preceding/following statements could be rendered unreachable by UB or compile-time reductions (for example if Text does not exist or has zero length).\n\n- uint32\n  - The width and signedness of TextIndex affect increment and comparison semantics (possible wrap/overflow behaviour). To decide whether the ++TextIndex and the subsequent comparison can produce both outcomes (thus making either branch reachable), the exact typedef of uint32 and its range must be known.\n\n- vsnprintf (declaration/attributes)\n  - If vsnprintf is declared or implemented in this project with a noreturn attribute, as a macro that longjmps/aborts, or otherwise does not return, then the code after the call (va_end and the return) would be unreachable. The function declaration/implementation is required to rule that in or out.\n\n- va_list, va_start, va_end (stdarg macros/declarations)\n  - These macros could be project-defined wrappers or altered in a way that affects control flow. Confirming they are the standard macros (and do not change control flow or expand to noreturn behavior) is necessary to determine reachability of subsequent statements.\n\nNote: The items above are the minimal additional symbols/definitions needed to reason about whether any statements in UtSprintf can never be executed (the MISRA \"no unreachable code\" rule). Other project-wide compiler settings or nonstandard macro substitutions that affect control flow (e.g., replacing vsnprintf with an aborting macro) should also be considered, but those are covered by checking the declarations/definitions listed."
