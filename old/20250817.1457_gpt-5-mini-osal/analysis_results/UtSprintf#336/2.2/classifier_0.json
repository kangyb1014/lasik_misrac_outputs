Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtSprintf:\n```c\nchar *UtSprintf(const char *Spec, ...)\n{\n    va_list                     Args;\n    static UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t Buf[UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS];\n    static uint32               TextIndex = 0;\n\n    ++TextIndex;\n    if (TextIndex >= UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS)\n        TextIndex = 0;\n\n    va_start(Args, Spec);\n    vsnprintf(Buf[TextIndex].Text, sizeof(Buf[TextIndex].Text), Spec, Args);\n    va_end(Args);\n\n    return Buf[TextIndex].Text;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtSprintf:\n#define UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS 10\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    char Text[UT_SNPRINTF_BUF_SIZE];\n} UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatic uint32               TextIndex = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The static variable TextIndex is referenced in UtSprintf (it is incremented and tested), so the variable is live \u2014 removing it would change program behaviour. The explicit initializer \"= 0\" is redundant because objects with static storage are zero-initialized, but that redundancy is not an executed dead operation. If TextIndex were never used, that would be a Rule 2.2 violation; as written, Rule 2.2 is not violated."
