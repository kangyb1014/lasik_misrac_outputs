  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified: Spec is already declared as const char * (compliant); va_list Args is not a pointer-to-object type requiring const qualification; the static buffer declaration (static UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t Buf[UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS];) defines an array of structs whose Text member must be mutable because vsnprintf writes into it, so it cannot be const; TextIndex is an integer not a pointer; the typedef for UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t and the macro UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS are not pointer declarations. The only pointer-related occurrences to assess for Rule 8.13 are the function return type (char *) and the actual return expression returning the buffer pointer, which are reported above."
