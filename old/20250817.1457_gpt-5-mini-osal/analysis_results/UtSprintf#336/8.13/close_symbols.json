  "explanation": "1) UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t \u2014 the full struct/type definition is required so the analyzer can see how the buffer is declared (especially whether the Text member is an array of char, a pointer, or declared const). If Text is a non-const array of char then the returned pointer necessarily points to mutable storage and returning char * may be justified; if Text were declared const char[] or const char *, that would indicate a mismatch with the function return type.\n\n2) UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t::Text \u2014 the exact declaration of the Text member (its type and dimensions) is the key symbol to decide const-qualification. The sizeof() in the function depends on Text being an array; whether Text is char Text[] or const char Text[] or char *Text matters for whether the returned pointer could/should be const.\n\n3) UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS \u2014 the macro that sizes the static Buf[] array. The analyzer needs this to understand the lifetime/structure of the static storage and to confirm Buf is indeed a fixed-size array of UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (and not some other type or zero-sized), which affects whether returning an address into it is safe and whether const-qualification could be applied.\n\n4) vsnprintf (prototype) \u2014 the standard prototype (int vsnprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, va_list ap)) is required because it documents that vsnprintf writes into the buffer (first parameter is char *). That forces the Text member to be modifiable (non-const); thus returning a non-const char * may be necessary and not a MISRA violation. The analyzer must confirm the call requires a writable buffer."
