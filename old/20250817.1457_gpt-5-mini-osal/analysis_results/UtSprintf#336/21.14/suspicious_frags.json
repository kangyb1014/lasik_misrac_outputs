  "explanation": "I examined the provided UtSprintf implementation and the related definitions. The MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 concerns using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. There is no use of memcmp (directly or via macro) anywhere in the shown code fragments. The only string-related function called is vsnprintf, which formats data into a buffer and does not perform string comparisons. The UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t definition and the UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS macro likewise contain no memcmp usage. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that should be investigated for Rule 21.14. (If memcmp is used elsewhere in other translation units, those files would need to be inspected, but they were not provided.)"
