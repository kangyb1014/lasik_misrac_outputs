  "explanation": "- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t: You must see the full struct/type definition to know what Buf[].Text actually is (char array, pointer, size) and whether any accessor/metadata or helper functions tied to that type might call memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS: The macro value is needed to understand buffer indexing/wrapping behaviour (e.g., corner cases when it is 0 or 1) and to locate all possible Buf[] elements that could carry string data that might be compared elsewhere.\n- Buf[].Text (the Text member declaration/size): The exact declaration (type and size) of the Text member is required to determine whether vsnprintf is guaranteed to produce a NUL-terminated string here and to check whether any subsequent comparisons of that buffer could be using memcmp incorrectly.\n- vsnprintf (project/CRT implementation or any project wrapper/macro): The symbol may be a macro or project wrapper. You need the implementation/mapping to confirm it does not internally call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, or that the build does not replace it with a custom routine that does.\n- memcmp (standard library or any project replacement/alias): To verify the MISRA rule you must find all uses/aliases of memcmp reachable from this code (including project replacements) and check whether they are used to compare null-terminated strings that originate from Buf[].Text.\n- uint32 typedef (definition): The typedef for uint32 is needed only to confirm the type/width/overflow behaviour of TextIndex for wrap-around reasoning; this can affect which buffer indices are reachable and therefore which buffers/strings might be later compared using memcmp."
