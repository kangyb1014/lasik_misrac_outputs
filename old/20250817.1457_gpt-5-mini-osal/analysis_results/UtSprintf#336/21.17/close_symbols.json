  "explanation": "UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t \u2014 The full type definition of the buffer element is required to know the storage layout and to determine whether .Text is an array embedded in the struct or a pointer to externally allocated memory; that changes whether sizeof(Buf[TextIndex].Text) yields the actual buffer capacity or just a pointer size.\n\nUT_Snprintf_Buffer_t::Text \u2014 The exact declaration of the Text member (char Text[N]; vs char *Text;) and, if an array, the compile\u2011time element count N. This is the direct buffer whose bounds must not be exceeded by vsnprintf; its size is required to check if the call can write past the end.\n\nUT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS \u2014 The value used to dimension the Buf array. If this value is zero or otherwise unexpected, indexing (TextIndex) could become invalid. Knowing this constant verifies that Buf[TextIndex] accesses are within the array bounds for all possible TextIndex values used by the function.\n\nvsnprintf \u2014 The exact prototype/standard semantics for the platform (return value behavior and guarantee of null termination when size>0). Although MISRA C rule in question names functions from <string.h>, vsnprintf writes into a provided buffer and its documented behavior (how it truncates, whether it always null-terminates, and the meaning of the size parameter) is essential to determine if the call can produce out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes.\n\nvsnprintf macro/redirect (platform-specific) \u2014 On some platforms/projects, vsnprintf may be #defined or aliased to a nonstandard implementation (e.g., _vsnprintf) with different semantics (no null termination, different return value). Any such mapping must be known because nonstandard behavior can change whether the buffer write is safe.\n\nuint32 typedef \u2014 The definition/width of uint32 is needed to confirm TextIndex\u2019s range and wrap behavior and to ensure there are no integer overflow/indexing issues that could make TextIndex refer outside Buf (for example if types/sizes differ from assumptions)."
