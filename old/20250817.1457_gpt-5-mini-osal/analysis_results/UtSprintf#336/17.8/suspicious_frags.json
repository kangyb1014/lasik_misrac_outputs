  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function modifies the parameter Spec (the pointer itself). Spec is declared as const char * and is never assigned to, incremented/decremented, or cast to a non-const pointer. The uses of Spec are: as the last named parameter to va_start (which does not modify the parameter) and as the format argument to vsnprintf (which takes a const char * and does not modify the pointer). The function does modify only static objects (Buf and TextIndex) and returns a pointer into a static buffer; these are not modifications of a function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
