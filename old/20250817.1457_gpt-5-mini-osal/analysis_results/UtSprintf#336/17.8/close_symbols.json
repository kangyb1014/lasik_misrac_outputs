  "explanation": "UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t: The function writes into Buf[TextIndex].Text. You must know the definition of UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (in particular the type of its Text member \u2014 e.g. char[] vs char * or some alias) to determine whether any write could alias or modify the pointer parameter Spec (or otherwise imply indirect modification of the parameter). UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS: The maximum buffer count affects indexing/wrap logic; knowing its value and semantics helps reason about possible aliasing/overlap of buffers and whether Buf[...] could ever refer to memory that aliases Spec. vsnprintf: The prototype (signature) shows whether the format parameter is declared const char * (i.e. not modified) and whether the function could modify its pointer argument; you need its declaration to establish that passing Spec to vsnprintf does not modify the Spec variable itself. va_list, va_start, va_end: These stdarg symbols/macros are used with Spec as the last fixed parameter. You need their definitions/semantics to confirm that using va_start(Args, Spec) and va_end(Args) does not modify the Spec parameter (the macros expand into code that manipulates the va_list but must not assign to the named parameter). uint32: The typedef for uint32 (underlying integer type) is required to confirm that incrementing TextIndex (TextIndex++ and the compare) is a normal integer operation with no hidden aliasing/side-effects that could affect Spec. Together these symbols let an analyst determine whether any operation in UtSprintf assigns to or otherwise modifies the parameter Spec (the MISRA rule concern) or could cause indirect modification via aliasing."
