The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol (concise):\n\n1) UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS\n   - This macro controls the wrap-around logic (TextIndex bound). Although the function contains no explicit for statement, the MISRA for-loop rule requires checking that no for-loops are introduced by macro expansions or that loop control variables are not hidden by macros. Inspecting this macro confirms it does not expand to any for-statement or alter loop semantics.\n\n2) UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t\n   - The struct/type definition is required to know the exact type and size of the .Text member (array vs pointer). Macro or type definitions could contain embedded macros or inline functions that introduce for-loops when accessed (e.g. if .Text is actually a macro that expands to an expression containing a for). Also sizeof(Buf[...].Text) depends on the member type.\n\n3) Buf (static variable type/definition)\n   - Even though Buf is declared in the function, the full definition of its element type (see UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t) is required to ensure that accessing Buf[TextIndex].Text does not invoke any hidden side-effects or macro expansions that could include a for statement. This confirms there are no for-loops induced by object access.\n\n4) uint32 (typedef)\n   - The type of TextIndex affects integer width and wrap-around behaviour. While the MISRA for-loop rule is about for statements, integer type definitions could be implemented via macros or typedefs that expand oddly in some build environments; confirm it is a plain unsigned integer type and that ++TextIndex cannot be a macro that expands into a for-loop or other control structure.\n\n5) vsnprintf (declaration and implementation/source if available)\n   - The rule states that the behaviour of a for-loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. If there were a for-loop in UtSprintf whose body called vsnprintf, you would need to inspect vsnprintf for compliance. Here, UtSprintf calls vsnprintf outside any for; still, to be exhaustive you must verify that the call to vsnprintf is not introduced inside a for-loop by macro expansions and that vsnprintf's prototype/macros do not expand to for-loops.\n\n6) va_list / va_start / va_end (stdarg macros/definitions)\n   - va_start/va_end are macros on some implementations. Confirming their definitions ensures they do not expand to control-flow constructs (for-loops) which could create for-statements in this function via macro expansion. Also check that they have no persistent side effects relevant to loop control.\n\n7) Any macros that expand ++TextIndex or the if (TextIndex >= UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS) wrap\n   - On some platforms projects use macros to redefine operators or control-flow. Verify there are no macros in scope that replace ++, >=, or the TextIndex identifier with more complex code that could introduce for-loops or modify loop-control semantics.\n\nSummary: The function source contains no explicit for loops, so there is no direct violation of the MISRA for-loop rule in this function. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to confirm that no for-loops are introduced indirectly (via macro expansion, type definitions, or called-function bodies) and to verify the absence of hidden loop constructs or nonconforming macro behaviour."
