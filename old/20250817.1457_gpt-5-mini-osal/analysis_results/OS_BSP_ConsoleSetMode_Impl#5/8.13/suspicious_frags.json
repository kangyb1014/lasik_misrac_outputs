  "explanation": "The rest of the code does not present pointers that could/should be const-qualified: OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl has no pointer parameters; the local buffer 'param' is a mutable char array used as snprintf destination (so cannot be const); calls to OS_BSP_ExecTput supply string literals or the mutable buffer (string literals are compatible with const char * and the function parameters are already const-qualified). Other system calls (fork, waitpid, exit) do not introduce pointer targets that could be made const. The only area requiring investigation is the call to execlp, which may have a differing expected type for its varargs (potentially non-const char *), and the surrounding OS_BSP_ExecTput prototype in context of that call."
