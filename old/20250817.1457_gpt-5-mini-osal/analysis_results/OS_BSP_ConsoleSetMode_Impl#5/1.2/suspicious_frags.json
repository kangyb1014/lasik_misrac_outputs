  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragments present are standard C language constructs and standard/POSIX library interfaces, not compiler-specific extensions: - Control structures (if/else, return), function definitions, static storage class, char arrays, snprintf and macros are standard C (snprintf is C99). - Bitwise operations and macro-based constants (OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_*, OS_BSP_CONSOLEMODE_TO_ANSICOLOR) are preprocessor features and standard C expressions. - pid_t, fork(), execlp(), waitpid(), exit(), and related headers are POSIX APIs, not compiler language extensions (they are platform/library calls). - No use of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({:}), nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords or builtins is present. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
