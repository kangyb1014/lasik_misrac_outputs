  "explanation": "I inspected all pointer usages in the provided code and related definitions. The following items do NOT require investigation for Rule 8.13: - The parameter devname in OS_rmfs is declared const char * (already const-qualified). - OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl accepts a const OS_object_token_t * (already const-qualified). - The token parameter in OS_ObjectIdGetByName is an output/transfer token and is written to by the called functions, so it must be non-const. - OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete (included above as suspicious to check if constness is appropriate) is observed to modify or use token in a way that requires a non-const pointer (it calls OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish and uses token->obj_id), so other uses of token in the code are appropriate as non-const. - The NULL passed to OS_NotifyEvent is an explicit null pointer constant and not relevant to const qualification. The only clear potential const-qualification issue is where a const char * (name) is cast to (void *) and passed to OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch; this discards constness and should be investigated. Other pointer parameters in the shown code are either already const or are legitimately non-const because they are modified."
