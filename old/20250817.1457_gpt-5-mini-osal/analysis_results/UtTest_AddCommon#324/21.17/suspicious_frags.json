  "explanation": "Only calls to functions from <string.h> in this function are the memset and strncpy lines above; those calls should be investigated for potential out-of-bounds accesses per MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. All other statements in the function (assignments to Test/Setup/Teardown/TestName buffer usage aside from the strncpy call, the if (TestName != NULL) condition, UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock, and the UtList_Add invocation) do not call <string.h> routines and therefore are not subject to this specific rule and do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.17."
