  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter (queue_id) and there are no assignments to or modifications of that parameter in the body \u2014 it is only passed by value to OS_ObjectIdGetById. The other addresses passed (&token) refer to a local variable (token), not to a function parameter of OS_QueueDelete; passing a pointer to a local object is allowed and does not indicate modification of this function\u2019s parameter. No pointer parameters of OS_QueueDelete itself are altered, and no parameter variables are reassigned, so there are no fragments in this function that appear to violate Rule 17.8."
