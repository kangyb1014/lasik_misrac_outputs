  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I reviewed all of the provided source fragments and found no for statements to assess against MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The rule specifically targets the three clauses of a for statement and the presence/usage of a loop counter; none of the supplied code snippets contain a for loop. The iterative construct present is a while(true) loop in OS_ObjectIdConvertToken, which is not governed by Rule 14.2. Other constructs are if/else, function calls, and macros (e.g. OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) shown as invocations but with no visible for-loop expansions in the provided text. If there are for loops inside omitted macros or in other source files not provided here, those were not available for inspection; please supply any code containing for statements (including macro definitions that may expand to for loops) so they can be evaluated for compliance with Rule 14.2."
