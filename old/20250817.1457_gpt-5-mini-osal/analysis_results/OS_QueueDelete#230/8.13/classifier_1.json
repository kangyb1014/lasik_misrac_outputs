  "scenario": "Cannot determine from this call alone. The fragment only shows a pointer being passed (&token); Rule 8.13 is concerned with the declaration of the pointer parameter. A violation would occur if OS_QueueDelete_Impl is declared to take OS_object_token_t * (non-const) but does not modify the object \u2014 in that case the parameter should be declared const OS_object_token_t * and the call should pass &token. If OS_QueueDelete_Impl is declared to take a pointer-to-const or actually modifies the token, then there is no violation."
