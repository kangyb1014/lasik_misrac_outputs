  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. The function uses only standard C constructs: a normal function definition, local variable declarations, typedef-based integer types (int32 mapped to int32_t), macro constants (OS_SUCCESS), and ordinary function calls. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, GCC builtins, or other documented compiler extensions. The custom type names and macros come from typedefs and #defines (not language extensions). The ellipses in the additional code are placeholders and not actual code. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
