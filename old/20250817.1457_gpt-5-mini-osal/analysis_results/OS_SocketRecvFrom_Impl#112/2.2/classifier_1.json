  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, void *buffer, size_t buflen, OS_SockAddr_t *RemoteAddr,\n                             int32 timeout)\n{\n    int32                           return_code;\n    int                             os_result;\n    int                             waitflags;\n    uint32                          operation;\n    struct sockaddr *               sa;\n    socklen_t                       addrlen;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);\n\n    if (RemoteAddr == NULL)\n    {\n        sa      = NULL;\n        addrlen = 0;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        addrlen = OS_SOCKADDR_MAX_LEN;\n        sa      = (struct sockaddr *)&RemoteAddr->AddrData;\n    }\n\n    operation = OS_STREAM_STATE_READABLE;\n    /*\n     * If \"O_NONBLOCK\" flag is set then use select()\n     * Note this is the only way to get a correct timeout\n     */\n    if (impl->selectable)\n    {\n        waitflags   = MSG_DONTWAIT;\n        return_code = OS_SelectSingle_Impl(token, &operation, timeout);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        if (timeout == 0)\n        {\n            waitflags = MSG_DONTWAIT;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /* note timeout will not be honored if >0 */\n            waitflags = 0;\n        }\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        if ((operation & OS_STREAM_STATE_READABLE) == 0)\n        {\n            return_code = OS_ERROR_TIMEOUT;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            os_result = recvfrom(impl->fd, buffer, buflen, waitflags, sa, &addrlen);\n            if (os_result < 0)\n            {\n                if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK)\n                {\n                    return_code = OS_QUEUE_EMPTY;\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    OS_DEBUG(\"recvfrom: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n                    return_code = OS_ERROR;\n                }\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                return_code = os_result;\n\n                if (RemoteAddr != NULL)\n                {\n                    RemoteAddr->ActualLength = addrlen;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl:\nextern OS_impl_file_internal_record_t OS_impl_filehandle_table[OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES]\n...\n#define OS_SOCKADDR_MAX_LEN 28\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (RemoteAddr == NULL)\n    {\n        sa      = NULL;\n        addrlen = 0;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not a violation. The assignments sa = NULL and addrlen = 0 are executed when RemoteAddr == NULL so that later use (pass of sa and &addrlen to recvfrom and the conditional update of RemoteAddr->ActualLength) operate on defined values. Removing these statements could lead to use of uninitialized variables or change runtime behavior, so they are not dead code."
