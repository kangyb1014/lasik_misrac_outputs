  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they are either non-pointer scalar operations, already use const where appropriate, or involve pointers that are intentionally non-const because they are modified by the called API: - The 'token' parameter is already a pointer to a const-qualified type. - 'buffer' is an output buffer passed to recvfrom and must be writable by that API. - 'sa' and '&addrlen' are passed to recvfrom as destination/length outputs and therefore must be non-const. - Local scalar variables (return_code, os_result, waitflags, operation, addrlen, impl when used only for access) are not pointer types and are out of scope for Rule 8.13. - The use of errno and related error-handling expressions do not introduce pointer const-qualification issues relevant to Rule 8.13. Other lines only perform control flow or arithmetic and do not involve pointer const qualification."
