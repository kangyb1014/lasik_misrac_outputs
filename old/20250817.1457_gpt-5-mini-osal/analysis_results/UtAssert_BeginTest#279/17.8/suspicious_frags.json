  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. In UtAssert_BeginTest the parameter is declared as const char *SegmentName and is only used for reading (passed to strncpy and to UT_BSP_StartTestSegment). There is no assignment to SegmentName, no pointer arithmetic on it, and no redefinition that would modify the pointer itself. strncpy writes into CurrentSegment (a separate global array), which is allowed (the object referred to by the parameter may be accessed but the pointer variable is not modified). UT_BSP_StartTestSegment also takes a const char * parameter and only reads it (uses it in snprintf), so it does not modify its parameter either. Other statements in the function (memset, assignment to TestSegmentCount, calls to UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock) do not modify any function parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
