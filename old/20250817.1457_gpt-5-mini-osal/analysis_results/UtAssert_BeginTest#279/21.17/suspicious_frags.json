Other agents can not investigate other fragments that you do not report, so it is very important to find all suspicious fragments without missing any.

  "explanation": "Only uses of the <string.h> functions and related buffer-indexing expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The other lines in the function do not invoke string.h routines or perform indexed memory writes that could be caused by those routines, and therefore do not need investigation for this rule: the local declaration of TestSegmentCount, the arithmetic assignment to TestSegmentCount, the calls to UT_BSP_Lock(), UT_BSP_Unlock(), and UT_BSP_StartTestSegment(...) are not string.h calls and do not themselves cause accesses beyond object bounds under this rule."
