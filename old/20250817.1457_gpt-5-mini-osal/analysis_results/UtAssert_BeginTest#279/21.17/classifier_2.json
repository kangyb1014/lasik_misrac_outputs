  "scenario": "If CurrentSegment is not an array with at least sizeof(CurrentSegment) bytes (for example if it is declared as a pointer: char *CurrentSegment), then sizeof(CurrentSegment) yields the pointer size (e.g. 8 on 64-bit). strncpy(CurrentSegment, SegmentName, sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1) would copy up to that many bytes into a buffer that is smaller, and the subsequent explicit write CurrentSegment[sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1] = 0 will write beyond the actual buffer bounds. This out\u2011of\u2011bounds access violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
