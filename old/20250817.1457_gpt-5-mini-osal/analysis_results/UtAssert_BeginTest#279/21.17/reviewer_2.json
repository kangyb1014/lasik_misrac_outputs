  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following UtAssert_BeginTest code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of UtAssert_BeginTest.\n```c\nvoid UtAssert_BeginTest(const char *SegmentName)\n{\n    uint32 TestSegmentCount;\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n\n    memset(&UT_SegmentCounters, 0, sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters));\n    strncpy(CurrentSegment, SegmentName, sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1);\n    CurrentSegment[sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1] = 0;\n    TestSegmentCount                           = 1 + UT_TotalCounters.TestSegmentCount;\n\n    UT_BSP_Unlock();\n\n    UT_BSP_StartTestSegment(TestSegmentCount, SegmentName);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:If CurrentSegment is not an array with at least sizeof(CurrentSegment) bytes (for example if it is declared as a pointer: char *CurrentSegment), then sizeof(CurrentSegment) yields the pointer size (e.g. 8 on 64-bit). strncpy(CurrentSegment, SegmentName, sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1) would copy up to that many bytes into a buffer that is smaller, and the subsequent explicit write CurrentSegment[sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1] = 0 will write beyond the actual buffer bounds. This out\u2011of\u2011bounds access violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void UtAssert_LogProbe(const char *phase, const char *SegmentName)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2239.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"Phase: %s\\n\", phase);\n    fprintf(f, \"  SegmentName ptr=%p\\n\", (const void *)SegmentName);\n    if (SegmentName != NULL) {\n        /* compute length without using library string functions to avoid extra dependencies */\n        size_t seglen = 0;\n        const char *p = SegmentName;\n        while (*p != '\\0') { seglen++; p++; }\n        fprintf(f, \"  SegmentName length=%zu\\n\", seglen);\n    } else {\n        fprintf(f, \"  SegmentName is NULL\\n\");\n    }\n\n    /* Log metadata about CurrentSegment (address and compile-time sizeof) without dereferencing */\n    fprintf(f, \"  CurrentSegment addr=%p\\n\", (const void *)CurrentSegment);\n    fprintf(f, \"  sizeof(CurrentSegment)=%zu\\n\", (size_t)sizeof(CurrentSegment));\n    fprintf(f, \"  sizeof(void*)=%zu\\n\", (size_t)sizeof(void *));\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nvoid UtAssert_BeginTest(const char *SegmentName)\n{\n    uint32 TestSegmentCount;\n\n    UT_BSP_Lock();\n    UtAssert_LogProbe(\"after UT_BSP_Lock\", SegmentName);\n\n    memset(&UT_SegmentCounters, 0, sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters));\n    UtAssert_LogProbe(\"after memset\", SegmentName);\n\n    /* Log the planned copy size and pointers just before strncpy */\n    {\n        size_t planned_copy = (sizeof(CurrentSegment) > 0) ?

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 prohibits string.h calls that can access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. Agent A\u2019s scenario depends on CurrentSegment being a pointer so that sizeof(CurrentSegment) would be the pointer size and thus produce an incorrect copy length. The provided test log, however, shows sizeof(CurrentSegment)=64 in every run, a planned strncpy copy size of 63, and SegmentName lengths well below 63. The strncpy call therefore copies at most the buffer capacity minus one and the code explicitly writes the terminating NUL at index 63. The runtime evidence shows no out\u2011of\u2011bounds copy or write occurred. Therefore, based on the exhaustive test outputs given, the reported violation is not present in this compiled/configured code."
