  "scenario": "No violation: memset(&UT_SegmentCounters, 0, sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters)) passes the address of the object and its sizeof in bytes, so it does not access beyond the bounds of that object. This is the correct idiom to zero an object. Potential violation scenario (not present here): if UT_SegmentCounters were actually a pointer to dynamically allocated memory and the code mistakenly used sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters) (which yields the size of the pointer) or otherwise supplied a byte count larger than the actual allocation, then the call could access beyond the allocated object and violate Rule 21.17."
