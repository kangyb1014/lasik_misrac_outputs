  "scenario": "strncpy(CurrentSegment, SegmentName, sizeof(CurrentSegment) - 1) will read up to sizeof(CurrentSegment)-1 bytes from SegmentName. If SegmentName does not point to a NUL-terminated array within that many bytes (or points to an object smaller than that length), strncpy will read beyond the bounds of the object referenced by SegmentName. Also, if SegmentName is NULL or overlaps CurrentSegment, undefined/unsafe behaviour can occur."
