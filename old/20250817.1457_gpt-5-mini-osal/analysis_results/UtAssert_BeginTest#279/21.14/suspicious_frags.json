  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided code fragment. The code calls memset and strncpy and explicitly null-terminates CurrentSegment, but does not perform any memcmp-based comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no locations in this snippet that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings)."
