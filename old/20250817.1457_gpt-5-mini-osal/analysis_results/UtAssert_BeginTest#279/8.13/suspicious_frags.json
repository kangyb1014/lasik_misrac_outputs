  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they already use const-qualified pointer types or do not involve pointer parameters that could/should be const: - The function parameter in UtAssert_BeginTest is declared as const char *SegmentName, so it already meets Rule 8.13. - UT_BSP_StartTestSegment is declared with const char *SegmentName, so its pointer parameter is already const-qualified. - strncpy is used with SegmentName as the source (a const char *), which is correct; the destination (CurrentSegment) must be modifiable, so making it const would be incorrect. - snprintf is passed SegmentName (const) and ReportBuffer (a modifiable buffer used to build the string); ReportBuffer must be non-const to allow modification by snprintf. - The counter objects and scalar variables (UT_SegmentCounters, UT_TotalCounters, TestSegmentCount) are not pointer parameters and are irrelevant to Rule 8.13. The selected fragments are those involving char buffers or pointers passed to other functions (CurrentSegment and ReportBuffer usage, and the call to UT_BSP_DoText) and therefore warrant investigation to confirm whether the receiving APIs could/should accept const-qualified pointers."
