  "scenario": "No violation. CurrentSegment is a mutable array (static char CurrentSegment[64]) used as the destination of strncpy (it is written into), so it must be a non-const object. MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should point to const-qualified types when possible; this array is not a pointer and is intentionally modifiable. A concrete violation would be declaring a pointer to data that is never modified as char * instead of const char *, e.g. 'char *p = get_readonly_string();' instead of 'const char *p'."
