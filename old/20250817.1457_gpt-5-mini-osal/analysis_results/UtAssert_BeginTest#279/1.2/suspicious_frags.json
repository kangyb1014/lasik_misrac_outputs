  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and related symbols for compiler-specific or nonstandard language extensions (e.g. keywords or constructs explicitly documented as extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __inline__ (compiler-specific forms), __builtin_*, typeof (gcc extension), named sections, pragma with compiler-specific arguments, inline assembly, or other vendor-specific tokens). None are present. The code uses standard C constructs: function calls, local variable declaration, memset/strncpy/snprintf (standard library functions), a plain cast (unsigned int), static array definition, and brace initialization for globals. The identifier uint32 appears to be a typedef name (not a compiler extension token). Wrappers like UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock simply call implementation functions and do not use extension syntax. Therefore there are no code fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no explicit compiler language extensions found)."
