  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (A function parameter should not be modified). Reasons:\n\n- The pointer parameter is declared as const: const OS_object_token_t *token. This enforces that the pointed-to object cannot be modified through this parameter within the function.\n- There are no assignments to the parameter identifiers (token, offset, or whence) anywhere in the function body. The parameters are only read/used.\n- The macro invocation impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token); only dereferences token to pass the token object to the macro. The macro definition (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) takes the address of (tok) where tok is *token; for an lvalue expression *token this yields back the original pointer value and does not modify the pointer or the object. OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const OS_object_token_t * and only reads token->obj_idx, so no modification occurs.\n- offset and whence are passed by value and only inspected (whence used in a switch, offset cast to off_t for lseek). There are no statements that modify these parameters.\n\nTherefore, there are no instances in this function where a function parameter or the pointer parameter itself is modified; no fragments require further investigation under Rule 17.8."
