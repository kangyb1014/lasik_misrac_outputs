  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_GenericSeek_Impl the local variable impl is declared as a non-const pointer (OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) but it is only dereferenced for read access (impl->fd) and never used to modify the pointed-to record. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Declaring impl as const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl would express the intent and satisfy the rule; assigning the address of a non-const table element to a pointer-to-const is permitted in C. The only caveats would be if impl were later used for writes or passed to interfaces requiring a non-const pointer, which is not the case in the provided code. The failing test-harness compilation does not affect the correctness of the rule assessment."
