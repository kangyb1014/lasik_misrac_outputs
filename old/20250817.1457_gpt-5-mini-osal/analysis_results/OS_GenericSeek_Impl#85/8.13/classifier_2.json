  "scenario": "The local variable 'impl' is declared as a mutable pointer (OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) but in OS_GenericSeek_Impl it is only used for read-only access (impl->fd is read). According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible \u2014 e.g. declare as 'const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl'. Thus the code fragment 'impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);' contributes to a rule violation because the pointer is not const-qualified even though it could be."
