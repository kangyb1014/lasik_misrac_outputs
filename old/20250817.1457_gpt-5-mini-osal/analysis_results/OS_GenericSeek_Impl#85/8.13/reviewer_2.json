According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible \u2014 e.g. declare as 'const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl'. Thus the code fragment 'impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);' contributes to a rule violation because the pointer is not const-qualified even though it could be.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void os_probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/683.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging fails, do not alter program behavior; simply return. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_GenericSeek_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, int32 offset, uint32 whence)\n{\n    int                             where;\n    off_t                           os_result;\n    int32                           retval;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    os_probe_log(\"ENTER: OS_GenericSeek_Impl token_ptr=%p\", (const void *)token);\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);\n\n    /* Log the impl pointer immediately after retrieval to show how it's used. */\n    if (impl != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Attempt to log the file descriptor field which is later read-only in this function. */\n        os_probe_log(\"impl retrieved: impl_ptr=%p, impl->fd=%d\", (const void *)impl, impl->fd);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        os_probe_log(\"impl retrieved: impl_ptr=NULL\");\n    }\n\n    switch (whence)\n    {\n        case OS_SEEK_SET:\n            where = SEEK_SET;\n            break;\n        case OS_SEEK_CUR:\n            where = SEEK_CUR;\n            break;\n        case OS_SEEK_END:\n            where = SEEK_END;\n            break;\n        default:\n            os_probe_log(\"invalid whence: %u -> returning OS_ERROR\", (unsigned)whence);\n            return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    os_probe_log(\"whence=%u mapped where=%d offset=%d\", (unsigned)whence, where, (int)offset);\n\n    os_result = lseek(impl->fd, (off_t)offset, where);\n\n    os_probe_log(\"lseek called: fd=%d offset=%d where=%d -> os_result=%jd errno=%d (%s)\",\n                 impl->fd, (int)offset, where, (intmax_t)os_result, errno, strerror(errno));\n\n    if (os_result == (off_t)-1)\n    {\n        if (errno == ESPIPE)\n        {\n            /*\n             * this means the user tried to seek on a pipe, socket,\n             * or other fifo-like handle that doesn't support seeking.\n             *\n             * Use a different error code to differentiate from an\n             * error involving a bad whence/offset\n             */\n            retval = OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED;\n            os_probe_log(\"result: ESPIPE -> retval=%d\", retval);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /*\n             * Most likely the \"whence\" and/or \"offset\" combo was not valid.\n             */\n            OS_DEBUG(\"lseek: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n            retval = OS_ERROR;\n            os_probe_log(\"result: lseek error (%d: %s) -> retval=%d\", errno, strerror(errno), retval);\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * convert value to int32 type for returning to caller.\n         * Note that this could potentially overflow an int32\n         * for a large file seek.\n         */\n        retval = (int32)os_result;\n        os_probe_log(\"success: os_result=%jd -> retval=%d\", (intmax_t)os_result, retval);\n    }\n\n    os_probe_log(\"EXIT: OS_GenericSeek_Impl returning retval=%d\", retval);\n\n    return retval;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_GenericSeek_Impl.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_GenericSeek_Impl the local pointer impl is only used for read-only access (impl->fd is read and passed to lseek); the function never modifies the object through impl. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires a pointer to be const-qualified wherever possible, so declaring impl as const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl would satisfy the rule. Assigning the (non-const) result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET to a pointer-to-const is allowed (adding const), so changing the declaration is safe here. The empty test log is unrelated to the static-quality issue. (As always, verify there are no later modifications through impl or API expectations that require a non-const pointer before making the change.)"
