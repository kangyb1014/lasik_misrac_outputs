  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not involve pointers that could reasonably be const-qualified for Rule 8.13: the function parameter token is already a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token); local scalar variables (where, os_result, retval, offset, whence) are non-pointer types; the call to lseek uses primitive types (impl->fd, offset, where) and does not pass pointers that could be const-qualified; OS_ObjectIndexFromToken is declared to take a const OS_object_token_t * so its prototype already enforces const-correctness. The listed fragments are the only points where a pointer to a non-const object is obtained/used while the data appears to be only read (so a const-qualified pointer may be appropriate), and strerror(errno) returns a non-const char * that is used only for printing (so treating it as const char * could be considered). Other code in the snippet does not present additional candidate locations for applying Rule 8.13."
