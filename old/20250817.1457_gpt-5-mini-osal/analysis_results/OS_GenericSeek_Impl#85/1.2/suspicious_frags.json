  "explanation": "I examined the entire function and the related symbol definitions for constructs that are explicit compiler language extensions (e.g. GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, __builtin_*, __extension__, or other vendor-specific keywords). None are present in the shown code.\n\nNotes supporting this conclusion:\n- No vendor-specific identifiers (double-underscore keywords like __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __extension__, etc.) are used.\n- The variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) is a standard C99 feature (variadic macros), not a compiler extension.\n- All casts, function calls (lseek, strerror), errno usage, and type names (off_t, int32_t/uint32_t aliases) are standard C/POSIX/library constructs rather than language extensions.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to an address-of-index expression; this uses ordinary C operators and does not rely on any extension.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in the provided code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
