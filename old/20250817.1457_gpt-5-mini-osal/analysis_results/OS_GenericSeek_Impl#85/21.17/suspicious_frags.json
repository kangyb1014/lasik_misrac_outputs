  "explanation": "I found no uses of the string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) in the provided OS_GenericSeek_Impl implementation. The only function related to string handling present is strerror(errno) inside the OS_DEBUG call; strerror does not take a caller-supplied buffer pointer (it returns a pointer to an internal/static string) and thus does not risk accessing beyond the bounds of objects referenced by caller pointer parameters. The OS_DEBUG macro is defined empty in the supplied additional code, so there is no hidden string operation there; even if OS_DEBUG were defined differently, the visible use only passes the strerror result to a formatted output and does not itself pass any caller buffer pointer to a string.h function. All other operations (lseek, token indexing, errno checks, casts) are unrelated to <string.h> string-handling routines. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under Rule 21.17."
