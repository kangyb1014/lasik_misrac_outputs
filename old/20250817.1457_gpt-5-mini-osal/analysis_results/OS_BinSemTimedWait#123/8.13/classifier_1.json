  "scenario": "The declaration 'OS_object_token_t token;' does not violate Rule 8.13 as written because it is not a pointer type (token is an object, not a pointer). Rule 8.13 applies only to pointer types. However, if OS_object_token_t were typedef'ed as a pointer type (for example 'typedef SomeType * OS_object_token_t;'), then this declaration would violate Rule 8.13 because the pointer would not point to a const-qualified type. In that hypothetical case it should be declared as a pointer to const (e.g. 'const SomeType *token') when the pointed-to object does not need to be modified."
