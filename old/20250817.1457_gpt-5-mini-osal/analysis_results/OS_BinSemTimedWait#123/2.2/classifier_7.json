The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BinSemTimedWait:\n```c\nint32 OS_BinSemTimedWait(osal_id_t sem_id, uint32 msecs)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n    int32             return_code;\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sem_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl(&token, msecs);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BinSemTimedWait:\nint32 OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, osal_id_t id, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit(lock_mode, idtype, token);\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return return_code;\n    }\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex(idtype, id, &token->obj_idx);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        token->obj_id = id;\n\n        /*\n         * The \"ConvertToken\" routine will return with the global lock\n         * in a state appropriate for returning to the caller, as indicated\n         * by the \"check_mode\" parameter.\n         *\n         * Note If this operation fails, then it always unlocks the global for\n         * all check_mode's other than NONE.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdConvertToken(token);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit(OS_lock_mode_t lock_mode, osal_objtype_t idtype, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    memset(token, 0, sizeof(*token));\n\n    /*\n     * Confirm that OSAL has been fully initialized before allowing any transactions\n     */\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER &&\n        OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * only \"exclusive\" locks allowed after shutdown request (this is mode used for delete).\n     * All regular ops will be blocked.\n     */\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState == OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER && lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE)\n    {\n        return OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * Transactions cannot be started on an object type for which\n     * there are no actual objects\n     */\n    if (OS_GetMaxForObjectType(idtype) == 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERR_INVALID_ID;\n    }\n\n    token->lock_mode = lock_mode;\n    token->obj_type  = idtype;\n    token->obj_idx   = OSAL_INDEX_C(-1);\n\n    if (lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)\n    {\n        OS_Lock_Global(token);\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex(osal_objtype_t idtype, osal_id_t object_id, osal_index_t *ArrayIndex)\n{\n    uint32         max_id;\n    uint32         obj_index;\n    osal_objtype_t actual_type;\n    int32          return_code;\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(ArrayIndex);\n\n    obj_index   = OS_ObjectIdToSerialNumber_Impl(object_id);\n    actual_type = OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl(object_id);\n\n    /*\n     * If requested by the caller, enforce that the ID is of the correct type.\n     * If the caller passed OS_OBJECT_TYPE_UNDEFINED, then anything is allowed.\n     */\n    if (idtype != OS_OBJECT_TYPE_UNDEFINED && actual_type != idtype)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERR_INVALID_ID;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        max_id = OS_GetMaxForObjectType(actual_type);\n        if (max_id == 0)\n        {\n            return_code = OS_ERR_INVALID_ID;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            *ArrayIndex = OSAL_INDEX_C(obj_index % max_id);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdConvertToken(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32               return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    uint32              attempts    = 0;\n    OS_common_record_t *obj;\n    osal_id_t           expected_id;\n\n    obj         = OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken(token);\n    expected_id = OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token);\n\n    /*\n     * Upon entry the ID from the token must be valid\n     */\n    if (!OS_ObjectIdIsValid(expected_id))\n    {\n        return OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If lock mode is RESERVED, then the ID in the record should\n     * already be set to OS_OBJECT_ID_RESERVED.
