  "explanation": "The function OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init has no formal parameters (signature: int32 OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init(void)), so MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) cannot be violated here. The only assignments in the body modify: (1) a local variable (local_id) used as the loop index, (2) global array elements OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd, and (3) global objects OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID. None of these are function parameters or pointer parameters, so they are outside the scope of Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided function that need investigation for this rule."
