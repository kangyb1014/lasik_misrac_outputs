  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and uses (that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible). In the target function and the provided related symbols there are no pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions to inspect: - OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init uses an integer index (osal_index_t) and assigns to the integer field fd of an array element; the array OS_impl_filehandle_table is a plain global array, not a pointer variable. - The calls to geteuid() and getegid() return scalar uid_t/gid_t values assigned to scalar globals; these are not pointers. - There are no function parameters that are pointers, no pointer arithmetic, and no pointer casts in the provided fragments. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not applicable to any fragment shown and nothing needs to be investigated for this rule."
