  "explanation": "- OS_impl_filehandle_table: The declaration (is it an array object or a pointer variable, and what qualifiers are on that pointer/type?) is required to determine whether a pointer is involved and whether it should/should not be const-qualified.\n- (type of) OS_impl_filehandle_table[] element structure (definition): The element struct definition (the type of OS_impl_filehandle_table[i]) is needed to see whether any members accessed or assigned (e.g. .fd) are pointer types; if a member is a pointer it may need const qualification per MISRA.\n- osal_index_t: The index type typedef is required to confirm that no pointer arithmetic or pointer-indexed aliasing is hidden by an unusual typedef that might be a pointer type rather than an integer.\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: The limit macro is needed to understand array bounds and the indexing pattern; if OS_impl_filehandle_table is actually a pointer-derived object, the loop usage may affect whether pointer-to-const would be appropriate.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: Declarations and types are needed to confirm these are scalar objects (not pointers) so they do not trigger the pointer-to-const rule.\n- geteuid (prototype) and getegid (prototype): Their prototypes confirm they return scalar uid/gid types rather than pointer types; if they returned pointers the MISRA pointer/const rule would apply.\n\nIn short: the primary symbols needed are the declaration/type of OS_impl_filehandle_table and the precise definition of its element type; the other symbols verify whether any other pointers are actually used in the function. This set is sufficient to determine whether any pointer in the function should instead point to a const-qualified type per the MISRA rule."
