  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\n```c\nint32 OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init(void)\n{\n    osal_index_t local_id;\n\n    /*\n     * init all filehandles to -1, which is always invalid.\n     * this isn't strictly necessary but helps when debugging.\n     */\n    for (local_id = 0; local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES; ++local_id)\n    {\n        OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd = -1;\n    }\n\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID = geteuid();\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid();\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init:\nOS_impl_file_internal_record_t OS_impl_filehandle_table[OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES]\n...\n#define OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES 50\n...\ntypedef uint32 osal_index_t\n...\nuid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID = 0\n...\ngid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = 0\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\nint32 OS_API_Impl_Init(osal_objtype_t idtype)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_Posix_TableMutex_Init(idtype);\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return return_code;\n    }\n\n    switch (idtype)\n    {\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_QUEUE:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_QueueAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_BINSEM:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_BinSemAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_COUNTSEM:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_CountSemAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MUTEX:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_MutexAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_ModuleAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_TimeBaseAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_STREAM:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_DIR:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_DirAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_FILESYS:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_FileSysAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR:\n            return_code = OS_Posix_CondVarAPI_Impl_Init();\n            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_IMPL_SELF_EUID = geteuid();\n    OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID = getegid();\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: these two statements obtain the process effective UID/GID (geteuid/getegid) and store them in the global variables OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID. Removing them could change program behaviour if those globals are read later (e.g. for privilege checks or file ownership operations), so they are not provably dead from the provided code. (Note: if a whole-project analysis proves that OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID are never read anywhere, then these assignments would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.)"
