  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in OS_Posix_StreamAPI_Impl_Init or in the provided related symbols. The for-loop indexes OS_impl_filehandle_table from 0 to OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES-1; OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES is defined as 50 and the array is declared with that size, so there is no out-of-bounds indexing. Assigning fd = -1 does not involve any string handling. The assignments to OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID use geteuid()/getegid() (no string operations) and store into uid_t/gid_t variables. Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, and no further investigation of string-handling violations is needed."
