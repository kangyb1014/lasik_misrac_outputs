  "explanation": "- OS_impl_filehandle_table: Need the declaration (is it an array, pointer, or dynamically allocated buffer) and its compile-time or run-time length to determine whether indexing with local_id can access beyond the table bounds. This is the primary memory object being indexed in the loop.  \n- (type) definition of elements stored in OS_impl_filehandle_table (struct containing member \"fd\"): Need the element type to confirm the presence and offset of the member \"fd\" and ensure the indexing into the element accesses a valid field (not relying on e.g. bitfields or overlays that could cause out-of-bounds access).  \n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: Required to know how many iterations the loop performs and whether that matches the actual number of entries in OS_impl_filehandle_table; central to any bounds-check analysis.  \n- osal_index_t: The typedef (signed/unsigned and width) is needed to reason about the range of local_id, integer promotions, and potential overflow/underflow that could lead to out-of-bounds indexing.  \n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: Declarations/types are needed to check the assignments from geteuid/getegid for side effects or macros that might expand to other code (e.g. wrappers) that could call string functions or perform memory accesses.  \n- geteuid (prototype) and getegid (prototype): Include prototypes to confirm they are simple system calls returning uid_t and do not expand (via macros) into other code that might use string.h functions or perform unexpected memory operations.  \n- OS_SUCCESS: The return constant/type to confirm there are no hidden expressions/macros involved that could expand into other calls.  \n\nRationale: The MISRA rule concerns use of string.h functions and out-of-bounds accesses. The target function itself contains no direct string.h calls; therefore the only relevant potential for out-of-bounds is the array indexing OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id]. To prove compliance you must know the table shape, element layout, loop bound (OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES), and index type (osal_index_t). The other symbols (geteuid/getegid, OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID/EGID, OS_SUCCESS) are included to ensure those identifiers are simple and not macros/wrappers that could introduce hidden string.h calls or memory accesses."
