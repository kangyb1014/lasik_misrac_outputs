  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses standard C syntax (for loop, assignment, return) and calls POSIX library functions (geteuid, getegid) which are not compiler language extensions but standard POSIX APIs. The typedefs and macros shown (osal_index_t, OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES, OS_SUCCESS, uid_t, gid_t) are regular typedefs/macros, not compiler-specific keywords or extensions. There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), __builtin_..., __extension__, Microsoft-specific keywords, or other vendor-specific syntax. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
