  "explanation": "For each symbol: \n- osal_index_t: needed to inspect its typedef/definition to ensure it is not defined using a compiler-specific extension (e.g., __int128, typeof, or other non-standard typedef constructs).\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: the macro definition must be checked for use of compiler extensions (statement expressions, typeof, __extension__, or other non-standard constructs).\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table: the array declaration may carry compiler-specific attributes (section, aligned, __attribute__, __declspec) or be declared via an extension; its storage-class/placement could be an extension.\n- (type of OS_impl_filehandle_table) struct definition and declaration of its member 'fd': the element type and the 'fd' member type must be inspected to ensure they do not use extensions (bit-field types, non-standard integer types, attribute annotations, or compiler-specific storage qualifiers).\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: these identifiers may be macros or variables; their definitions must be checked for expansion to compiler-specific constructs or attributes.\n- geteuid (declaration/definition) and getegid (declaration/definition): verify that any local wrapper macros or prototypes do not use language extensions (e.g., wrappers using GCC statement expressions or inline assembly). The POSIX prototypes themselves are not language extensions, but local definitions might be.\n- OS_SUCCESS: the macro/enum value should be checked for any non-standard definition mechanism (macros using extensions).\n\nCollectively, these symbols cover all typedefs, macros, variables, array/struct declarations and external function definitions used by the target function; examining their definitions is necessary to determine whether any compiler/language extensions are employed that would violate the MISRA rule about language extensions."
