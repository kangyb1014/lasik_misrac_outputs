The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine compliance with the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rules you must know: \n\n- osal_index_t: The loop counter's type must be an integer type and its semantics (signed/unsigned, width) affect whether the init clause \"local_id = 0\" and the increment \"++local_id\" are valid and whether the counter may be modified elsewhere. This verifies clause 1 and clause 3 requirements (that the first clause initializes the loop counter and the third clause modifies only the loop counter).\n\n- OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES: The second-clause expression is \"local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES\". You must confirm this symbol is a compile-time constant or an object/constant with no persistent side effects and that it is not modified in the loop body. If this symbol were a function-like macro or an lvalue that can change, it could violate clause 2.\n\n- OS_impl_filehandle_table: The loop body writes to OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd. You must inspect the definition (whether it is a plain array/object or a macro/function) to ensure indexing has no hidden side effects, and that modifying the table element cannot alias or modify the loop counter or any object used in the loop clauses. This checks clause 2 and clause 4 (that no other object used in the clauses is modified in the loop body).\n\n- type of OS_impl_filehandle_table[] elements and its member 'fd': Knowing the element type and the 'fd' member is required to ensure the assignment in the body only affects that member and does not indirectly alter the loop counter or any object used in the loop clauses (e.g., via side-effecting accessor macros, overloaded semantics, or volatile/atomic behavior)."
