First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. The single for loop is well-formed: the first clause assigns the loop counter (local_id = 0), the second clause (local_id < OS_MAX_NUM_OPEN_FILES) uses only the loop counter and a compile-time constant and has no persistent side effects, and the third clause (++local_id) modifies only the loop counter. There is exactly one loop counter (local_id) and it is not modified in the loop body. The loop body writes to OS_impl_filehandle_table[local_id].fd, but that object is not used in the loop condition or increment expressions, so it does not violate the rule. The other statements (geteuid(), getegid(), return) are outside the loop and do not affect the for-statement well-formedness. Therefore no fragments need further investigation under Rule 14.2."
