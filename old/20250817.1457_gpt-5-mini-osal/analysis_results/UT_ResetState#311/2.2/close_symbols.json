  "explanation": "For deciding if UT_ResetState (the entire function or parts of it) is dead code you must know more than its body: 1) UT_ClearStubEntry \u2014 the callee\u2019s semantics and observable side-effects. If UT_ClearStubEntry performs I/O, updates global state, or has externally visible behavior then the calls inside the loop are not dead; if it is a no-op then those calls may be dead. 2) UT_StubTable \u2014 the array/pointer being iterated. You need to know its allocation, lifetime, and contents to determine whether the loop ever processes meaningful entries. If the table is never populated or its pointer is NULL, the loop body may be ineffective. 3) UT_StubTableEntry_t \u2014 the structure layout and the meaning of the FuncKey field. You must know which field is tested (FuncKey) and whether reading it has side-effects or is meaningful. 4) UT_EntryKey_t \u2014 the typedef/enum underlying type and semantic meaning of the value 0. The code treats 0 as a special case (reset-all); to judge usefulness you must know whether 0 is a valid sentinel or impossible/unused value. 5) UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS \u2014 the loop bound. If this constant is zero the loop never executes and the calls are dead; its compile-time or runtime value affects reachability of the loop body. 6) UT_MaxStubSearchLen \u2014 the global that is assigned when FuncKey==0. You must know where else this variable is read/used to determine whether writing 0 has any externally observable effect (i.e., whether that write is dead). 7) references to UT_ResetState (call sites / function-pointer tables / exported API) \u2014 static call graph shows no callers; to decide if the whole function is dead you must search for non-obvious invocations: address-taken uses, registrations in function-pointer tables, ISR/vtable entries, exported symbols used by other translation units or tests. If no references exist (including indirect ones), the entire function is dead.\\n\\nCollecting these symbols/definitions (and the implementation of UT_ClearStubEntry) is sufficient to determine whether the loop iterations, the conditional call, and the final assignment are observable or can be removed without changing program behaviour (i.e., whether they constitute dead code under the MISRA rule)."
