  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were reviewed and are not considered suspicious for dead code under Rule 2.2 for the following reasons:\n\n- Function header and local variable declarations (void UT_ResetState(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey), UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr; int32 i;) are necessary definitions and cannot be dead code.\n- The for-loop control (for (i = 0; i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS; ++i)) and the pointer increment (++StubPtr;) are active control-flow constructs required to iterate the table; they are executed and affect behavior, so not dead.\n- The call target UT_ClearStubEntry is included indirectly via the flagged if; other internal parts of that function beyond the free/memset lines above (e.g., the comment) are not executable code or are straightforward operations covered by the selected fragments.\n- Type and macro definitions (typedef cpuaddr UT_EntryKey_t, #define UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS 200, static uint32 UT_MaxStubSearchLen = 0, typedef struct UT_StubTableEntry_t { ... }) are declarations/definitions that cannot be classified as dead code per the rule (they do not represent executable operations whose removal would not affect runtime behavior in the same way).\n- The comment in UT_ClearStubEntry is non-executable and therefore not relevant.\n\nThe listed suspicious fragments were chosen because they contain conditional executions or resource-management operations whose removal or unconditional omission might not change observable behavior depending on how the rest of the program uses the table, allocations, the FuncKey parameter, and UT_MaxStubSearchLen. These should be investigated to confirm whether they are actually exercised and required, or whether they constitute dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
