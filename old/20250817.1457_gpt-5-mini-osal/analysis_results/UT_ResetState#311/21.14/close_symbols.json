  "explanation": "- UT_ClearStubEntry (function definition): UT_ResetState calls this function for each matching table entry. Any use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings could occur inside UT_ClearStubEntry, so its body must be inspected to detect a MISRA memcmp violation.\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t (struct/type definition): The struct defines the fields of each StubPtr entry (including the field named FuncKey used in the comparison). You must know the types of these fields (for example, whether any are char* or char arrays) to decide if memcmp would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n- UT_EntryKey_t (typedef/type): The parameter FuncKey is of this type. To determine whether comparisons or operations involving FuncKey relate to C strings (and therefore whether memcmp use would be comparing null-terminated strings), the underlying type of UT_EntryKey_t must be known (integer, pointer, char*, etc.).\n- UT_StubTable (global array/object): The loop walks this table; its element type is UT_StubTableEntry_t. Inspecting the actual table definition and initial contents can reveal whether string fields exist or are used in ways that would involve memcmp.\n- UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS (macro/constant): The loop upper bound; while not directly about memcmp, its value and definition help understand array bounds and whether any string comparisons might be performed across entries (off-by-one or length-related issues can affect string handling analysis).\n- UT_MaxStubSearchLen (global variable): UT_ResetState assigns to this variable when FuncKey == 0. Its purpose and later use elsewhere could influence whether subsequent code calls memcmp with lengths derived from this value (possible indirect memcmp usages), so its definition/use sites should be checked.\n- memcmp (standard library function): To detect a MISRA violation you must find any uses of memcmp (in UT_ClearStubEntry or any functions/data reachable from this code) and determine whether it is being applied to null-terminated strings. Including the memcmp symbol ensures the analyzer will search for and inspect actual memcmp calls and their arguments.\n\nThese symbols together let the next analyzer determine whether any code executed directly by UT_ResetState (or immediately invoked/affected functions and data) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, which would violate the stated MISRA rule."
