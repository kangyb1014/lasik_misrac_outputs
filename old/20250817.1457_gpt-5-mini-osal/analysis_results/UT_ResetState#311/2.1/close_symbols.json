  "explanation": "To determine whether any lines in UT_ResetState are statically unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) the analyzer needs the following symbols and why each matters:\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t: The type and value domain of FuncKey. You must know whether the type can take the value 0 (or has constrained/guarded values), signed/unsigned range, or special reserved values \u2014 this decides if the branches testing (FuncKey == 0) can ever be true or are impossible.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t: The structure definition (in particular the type and semantics of the member FuncKey). The loop condition uses StubPtr->FuncKey == FuncKey; knowing the member type and possible values is required to judge whether that comparison can ever be true and thus whether the call to UT_ClearStubEntry inside the loop can be reached for non-zero FuncKey.\n\n- UT_StubTable: The declaration/definition (pointer or array) and its initialization. If UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS > 0 but UT_StubTable is NULL or has zero storage, the loop body might be undefined/never effectively executed. The concrete definition/initializer and storage size are required to reason about reachability of the loop body and the StubPtr dereference.\n\n- UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS: The compile-time value (macro/constant) that bounds the loop. If this is zero or otherwise guaranteed to be zero at compile time, the for-loop body is never executed and is therefore unreachable. You must know this constant to decide loop reachability.\n\n- int32 (typedef): The integer type used for the loop index i (range and signedness). If int32 cannot represent UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS or has constraints that affect the loop (e.g., negative UB constants), this can affect whether the loop executes; include its definition to reason about loop iteration behavior.\n\n- UT_MaxStubSearchLen: The global variable assigned when FuncKey == 0. To determine if that assignment is dead/unreachable you must know whether there exists any valid call where FuncKey == 0; also its declaration helps decide whether the assignment is redundant versus having been set elsewhere.\n\n- UT_ClearStubEntry (prototype/definition): Although the call itself is visible, the implementation/prototype is required if that function can modify state used by UT_ResetState (for example entries in UT_StubTable or UT_MaxStubSearchLen). Such side-effects could influence reachability of subsequent iterations or make part of this function effectively redundant/unreachable.\n\n- All callers / call sites of UT_ResetState (if any): Reachability of the (FuncKey == 0) branch and the loop body depends on what actual values are ever passed to UT_ResetState in the project. If there are no callers in the project or all call sites never pass 0 (or never call it at all), then some branches may be unreachable \u2014 you must inspect all call sites to conclude that.\n\n- Definition/initialization of the UT_StubTable contents: The runtime contents (initial FuncKey values present in the table) determine whether the per-entry comparison StubPtr->FuncKey == FuncKey can be true for non-zero FuncKey. Knowing the initial/possible contents is necessary to conclude whether the conditional call to UT_ClearStubEntry can ever be reached for particular FuncKey values.\n\nThese symbols together provide the type and value domains, compile-time bounds, table storage/contents, side-effects of called routines, and call-site usage needed to conclude whether any part of UT_ResetState is statically or effectively unreachable under the project's usage (MISRA requirement)."
