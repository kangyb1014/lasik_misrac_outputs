  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. Reasoning: \n\n- First clause: \"i = 0\" is an initialization that sets the loop counter (i is declared as int32). This satisfies clause 1 (the clause either empty or an expression that sets or defines/initializes the loop counter).\n- Second clause: \"i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS\" uses only the loop counter and a compile-time constant. It has no persistent side effects and does not reference any object that is modified in the loop body, satisfying clause 2.\n- Third clause: \"++i\" modifies only the loop counter and does not use any object that is modified in the loop body, satisfying clause 3.\n- Single loop counter: There is only one loop counter (i) and it is not modified inside the loop body (only ++i in the for\u2019s third clause modifies it), satisfying the single-counter requirement.\n- Body effects: The body calls UT_ClearStubEntry(StubPtr) and increments StubPtr (++StubPtr). Although these modify objects, the second and third clauses do not reference those objects, and the rule permits the loop body (and called functions) to have behavior so long as the clauses meet their constraints.\n\nGiven the above, the for loop in UT_ResetState conforms to the stated requirements of Rule 14.2 and no code fragments need further investigation under this rule."
