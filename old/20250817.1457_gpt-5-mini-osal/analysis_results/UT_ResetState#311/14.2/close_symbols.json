The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "UT_ClearStubEntry: The body calls this function. MISRA requires the behaviour of any called functions to be considered as part of the loop body; you must inspect its prototype and implementation to ensure it does not modify the loop counter (i), UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS, or any object used in the for-clause (or otherwise introduce side-effects that would make the second/third clauses invalid).\n\nUT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS: Appears in the loop's second clause (i < UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS). You must know whether this symbol is a compile-time constant or a modifiable object (and if modifiable, whether it can be modified inside the loop body or by UT_ClearStubEntry). The rule forbids using objects in the second clause that are modified in the loop body.\n\nUT_StubTable: Assigned to StubPtr before the loop and iterated via ++StubPtr in the loop body. Its type/definition is needed to confirm that the pointer arithmetic in the body does not affect the loop counter and that it is not the loop counter itself (the rule permits only one loop counter).\n\nUT_StubTableEntry_t: The element type of UT_StubTable and the parameter type passed to UT_ClearStubEntry. Knowing this type helps determine whether UT_ClearStubEntry could have aliasing/side-effects that affect objects used in the for-clause.\n\nUT_EntryKey_t: The function parameter type; include to confirm it is not an integer alias that might be treated as a loop control flag or otherwise involved in the for-clause semantics.\n\nint32: The declared type of the loop counter variable i. MISRA requires the loop counter to be an integer type; include the typedef/definition to confirm i is an integer and to check for any unusual semantics (volatile, signed/unsigned rules, etc.).\n\nUT_MaxStubSearchLen: Written after the loop when FuncKey == 0; include to check whether UT_ClearStubEntry or other called code modifies this global during the loop (which could indicate wider side-effects). While not directly in the for-clause, its presence helps assess side-effects of functions called in the loop body.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether the for loop\u2019s three clauses and the called-function side-effects comply with the MISRA rule about well-formed for loops (single loop counter, no modification of objects used in the second clause, and called functions not modifying the loop counter or clause objects)."
