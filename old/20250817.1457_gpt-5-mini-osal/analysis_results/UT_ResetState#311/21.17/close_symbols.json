  "explanation": "UT_StubTableEntry_t: The structure layout (fields and any embedded buffers/arrays) is required to understand what UT_ClearStubEntry will operate on and whether any string.h functions inside UT_ClearStubEntry could access past bounds of fields referenced via the pointer passed from UT_ResetState.\n\nUT_EntryKey_t: The exact type (integer width and signedness) and possible reserved values (e.g. 0 meaning special-case) are needed to verify comparisons (FuncKey == 0) and to reason about which entries are processed \u2014 affects which buffers may be touched by ClearStubEntry.\n\nUT_StubTable: Declaration/definition (array vs pointer, allocated length) is required to confirm that incrementing StubPtr UT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS times does not walk beyond the actual allocated/defined table and to ensure ClearStubEntry is only called on valid entries.\n\nUT_MAX_FUNC_STUBS: The loop bound used by UT_ResetState; the concrete value (and whether it matches the actual UT_StubTable capacity) is necessary to determine whether the for-loop can cause out-of-bounds access when advancing StubPtr.\n\nUT_ClearStubEntry (definition/implementation): UT_ResetState itself does not call string.h functions, but it calls UT_ClearStubEntry for each entry. To determine MISRA string.h violations you must inspect UT_ClearStubEntry implementation to see if it calls memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc., and whether its arguments/lengths could be out-of-bounds for the passed StubPtr or its fields.\n\nUT_MaxStubSearchLen: The global modified when FuncKey == 0 \u2014 its type and use are required to ensure that changing it does not interact with other code that uses string.h functions on related buffers (and to check for any invariants/limits affecting buffer lengths elsewhere).\n\nint32 (typedef): Knowing the exact typedef (width and signedness) helps ensure the loop index 'i' and the loop bound comparison behave as intended (no unexpected wrap/overflow) which could lead to iterating past UT_StubTable and thereby expose buffers to out-of-bounds string.h calls.\n\nThese symbols together let an auditor verify (1) the pointer arithmetic over UT_StubTable is within allocated bounds, and (2) any string.h usage in UT_ClearStubEntry (or related code dependent on the struct fields/globals) does not access beyond the objects referenced by their pointer parameters."
