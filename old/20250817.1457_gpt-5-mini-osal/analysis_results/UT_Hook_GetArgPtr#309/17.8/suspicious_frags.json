  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to the parameters ContextPtr, Name, or ExpectedTypeSize (no statements like ContextPtr = ..., Name = ..., ExpectedTypeSize = ...).\n- Pointer parameters are only dereferenced or read (e.g., ContextPtr->ArgCount, ContextPtr->Meta[i], strcmp(..., Name)), which is allowed (the object referred to may be accessed or modified, but the pointer variable itself is not changed).\n- Taking the address of an element (&ContextPtr->ArgPtr[i]) or assigning a value from ContextPtr->ArgPtr[i] copies/produces a pointer/value but does not modify the parameter variable.\n- The fallback uses a static const union whose address is returned; this does not alter any parameter.\n- Calls to UtAssert_Failed and UtAssert_Abort pass parameters but do not constitute modification of the function\u2019s parameters within this function.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
