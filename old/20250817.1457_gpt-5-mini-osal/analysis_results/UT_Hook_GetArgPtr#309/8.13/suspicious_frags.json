  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they already use const-qualified pointee types or do not involve pointer target qualifications. The function return type is const void * (the pointer points to a const-qualified type). The parameter Name is declared as const char * (the pointee is const-qualified). ContextPtr is a pointer to const UT_StubContext_t and MetaPtr is declared as pointer to const UT_StubArgMetaData_t, so accesses via MetaPtr (other than the Name member usage already listed) do not indicate missing const qualification of the pointed-to type. Non-pointer objects (i, AsInt, AsFloat) and logical/size comparisons do not pertain to Rule 8.13. The UtAssert_* calls and the control-flow (loop, break, return) are not relevant to pointer pointee const-qualification. Therefore only the listed fragments (uses/definitions involving non-const pointer targets or pointer members that may be better const-qualified) need further investigation."
