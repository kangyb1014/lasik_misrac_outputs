  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_Hook_GetArgPtr:\n```c\nconst void *UT_Hook_GetArgPtr(const UT_StubContext_t *ContextPtr, const char *Name, size_t ExpectedTypeSize)\n{\n    uint32                      i;\n    const void *                Result;\n    const UT_StubArgMetaData_t *MetaPtr;\n\n    static const union\n    {\n        unsigned long AsInt;\n        void *        AsPtr;\n        double        AsFloat;\n    } ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE = {0};\n\n    Result = NULL;\n    for (i = 0; i < ContextPtr->ArgCount; ++i)\n    {\n        MetaPtr = &ContextPtr->Meta[i];\n        if (MetaPtr->Name != NULL)\n        {\n            if (strcmp(MetaPtr->Name, Name) == 0 && (MetaPtr->Size == 0 || MetaPtr->Size == ExpectedTypeSize))\n            {\n                if (MetaPtr->Type == UT_STUBCONTEXT_ARG_TYPE_DIRECT)\n                {\n                    Result = &ContextPtr->ArgPtr[i];\n                }\n                else if (MetaPtr->Type == UT_STUBCONTEXT_ARG_TYPE_INDIRECT)\n                {\n                    Result = ContextPtr->ArgPtr[i];\n                }\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If no suitable result pointer was found, this means a mismatch\n     * between the stub and test case, such as a change in argument/parameter names.\n     * This is an error that should be corrected, so report it as a failure.\n     */\n    if (Result == NULL)\n    {\n        UtAssert_Failed(\"Requested parameter %s of size %lu which was not provided by the stub\", Name,\n                        (unsigned long)ExpectedTypeSize);\n\n        if (ExpectedTypeSize <= sizeof(ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE))\n        {\n            Result = &ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /*\n             * As the caller will likely dereference the returned pointer, should\n             * never return NULL.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The for loop uses a single loop counter 'i' which is initialized in the first clause (i = 0), the condition uses the loop counter and ContextPtr->ArgCount (which is not modified in the loop body), and the third clause (++i) modifies only the loop counter. The statement MetaPtr = &ContextPtr->Meta[i]; merely reads the array element and does not modify the loop counter or ArgCount. Rule 14.2 is therefore satisfied. (A violation would occur if ArgCount or other objects used in the condition were modified inside the loop body, or if the loop counter were modified in the body.)"
