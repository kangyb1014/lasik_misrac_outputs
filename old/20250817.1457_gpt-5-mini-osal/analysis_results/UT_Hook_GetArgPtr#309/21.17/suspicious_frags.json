  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h>. The only such function call in this function is strcmp. Although MetaPtr->Name is checked for NULL immediately before this call, the parameter Name is not validated for NULL before being passed to strcmp; if Name is NULL, strcmp would dereference it and potentially access beyond the bounds of the object. No other calls to <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code, so there are no additional fragments relevant to Rule 21.17 to report. (Note: UtAssert_Failed uses a %s format specifier with Name, which could be a separate null-pointer/format issue, but it is not a use of any <string.h> function and therefore not directly in scope of Rule 21.17.)"
