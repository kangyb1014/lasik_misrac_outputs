  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in the given context. The check if (MetaPtr->Name != NULL) is necessary to avoid calling strcmp on a NULL pointer and to allow metadata entries with no name to be skipped. It is not dead code unless there is a program-wide invariant that MetaPtr->Name is guaranteed non-NULL for every Meta entry. In that specific hypothetical scenario \u2014 for example, if all UT_StubContext_t.Meta[] entries are always initialized at compile time to non-NULL string literals or otherwise enforced by construction \u2014 the condition would always be true and thus the test would be removable without changing behaviour (making it dead). Absent such a proven invariant, the check is required and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
