  "explanation": "I did not find any use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The following constructs were inspected and are standard C (not compiler extensions):\n\n- The static const union ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE with initializer = {0} is a standard anonymous (unnamed) union type definition with a variable initialization \u2014 this is allowed by standard C.\n- Implicit conversion between object pointers and void * (e.g., assigning &ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE to a const void *) is standard C pointer behavior.\n- Use of size_t and casting to unsigned long for printf-style formatting is standard C (not an extension); the code uses an explicit cast to match %lu.\n- The for-loop and increment ++i are standard C.\n- The strcmp, NULL pointer tests, pointer dereferences, and structure members usage are standard.\n- The UtAssert_Failed macro uses the standard C99 variadic macro __VA_ARGS__ form; variadic macros are part of the C99 standard (not a compiler extension when compiling in a C99-or-later mode).\n- Use of fixed-width integer typedefs (uint32_t) and typedef alias uint32 is standard (stdint.h is part of C99).\n\nNo occurrences were found of known compiler extensions such as GCC/Clang attributes (__attribute__), typeof, __extension__, inline assembly (asm), builtins (__builtin_*), Microsoft-specific extensions (like __declspec), or other vendor-specific language constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments that need to be flagged for investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
