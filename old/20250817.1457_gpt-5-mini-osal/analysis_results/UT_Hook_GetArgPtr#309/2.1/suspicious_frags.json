  "explanation": "Most of the function's control flow is clearly dependent on runtime inputs (ContextPtr->ArgCount, MetaPtr->Name, strcmp result, MetaPtr->Size, MetaPtr->Type) and thus is not statically unreachable. The loop and its branches that set Result for DIRECT/INDIRECT argument types are reachable for appropriate inputs and should not be flagged. The static union ARG_DEFAULT_ZERO_VALUE declaration is a valid static local and is used in the fallback path. The only code that may be genuinely unreachable (or conversely may cause later code to be unreachable) depends on whether the assertion helpers are implemented as noreturn: UtAssert_Failed and especially UtAssert_Abort are intended to report errors/abort \u2014 if either is implemented as a non-returning function in some build configurations then subsequent statements (notably the assignment to Result for the default zero value or the final return) could be unreachable. Because the implementation/behavior of those assertion helpers can vary by configuration, the if (Result == NULL) block (including the UtAssert_Failed call, the UtAssert_Abort call, and the final return) should be investigated. All other fragments in the function are data-dependent and thus not inherently unreachable, so they do not require investigation for Rule 2.1."
