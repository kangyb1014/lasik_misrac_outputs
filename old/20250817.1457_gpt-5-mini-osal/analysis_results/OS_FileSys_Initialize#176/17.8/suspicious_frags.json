  "explanation": "I found no statements that modify any of the function parameters themselves. Specifically:\n\n- address (char *): only read and assigned to filesys->address (filesys->address = address;). This copies the pointer value into the internal record; it does not change the parameter variable.\n- fsdevname (const char *): only used as an input (checked by OS_CHECK_STRING, indexed for emptiness fsdevname[0], passed to OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew and OS_OBJECT_INIT). There is no assignment to fsdevname itself. The uses copy or read the pointed-to characters; they do not modify the parameter variable.\n- fsvolname (const char *): only used as an input (OS_CHECK_STRING, strncpy reads from fsvolname to copy into filesys->volume_name). The source pointer (fsvolname) is not modified.\n- blocksize, numblocks, should_format: value parameters and are only read (assigned into fields of filesys or used in conditionals); none are assigned to.\n\nAll function calls/macros in this snippet pass the parameters by value (or pass the pointer as a read-only input). No code takes the address of any parameter (e.g., &address) or assigns to the parameter variable itself. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function body."
