  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The test logs you provided show that OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew always fails (return -35) in the exhaustive test runs, so the entire inner block (including the conditional call to OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl) is never executed. Code that cannot be executed is unreachable, and MISRA Note 2 explicitly distinguishes unreachable code from dead code \u2014 unreachable code is not classified as dead code under Rule 2.2. Separately, even if OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl is currently a no-op in one implementation, Agent A did not demonstrate that the call is executed in the project and that its removal would not change behaviour in all configurations. Given the provided (exhaustive) test results, the format call is not executed and thus the situation described by Agent A does not meet the definition of dead code in Rule 2.2."
