  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided fragments: OS_CountSemTake_Impl, the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, the OS_impl_count_sem_table declaration, the OS_object_token_t typedef usage, and the OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t definition. None of these use or invoke the C standard library function memcmp, nor do they perform any string operations or manipulate char* or null-terminated strings. The token is accessed via a numeric obj_idx field (no byte-wise comparison), and the function only calls sem_wait and returns status codes. Therefore there are no occurrences of memcmp or suspicious string comparisons in the provided code to investigate."
