  "explanation": "I marked the assignment using OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the macro itself because the macro takes its token argument in an unusual way (it takes the address of the macro parameter expression) which can hide double-evaluation or unexpected evaluation semantics depending on how the macro is used; this can lead to operations that are effectively no-ops or could be optimized away, so it should be inspected for potential dead operations. The sem_wait check and its branches are flagged because the error branch (returning OS_SEM_FAILURE) might never be reached in some build/configurations or wrappers, making the failure-return path potentially dead; likewise the unconditional return OS_SUCCESS on the success path could be redundant in some contexts and should be checked in the full program context. I included the semaphore record type, the global table declaration, the inline index extractor, and the OS_SUCCESS/OS_SEM_FAILURE macros because these symbols participate in the accessed operations and could contain or enable dead code (for example, unused table entries, trivial inline functions that are always optimized away, or macros/constants that are never used).\n\nWhy other fragments need not be investigated here: the remaining lines in the provided snippets are straightforward single-purpose operations (function header, sem_wait call itself, and simple returns) that are actually executed and affect observable behavior in the shown context. There is no evidence in the provided code of unreachable code (which is excluded by the rule note) nor of initialization masquerading as dead assignments. Without additional project-wide context (other translation units, linker scripts, or platform-specific wrappers) there are no other obvious operations in the shown fragments that meet the MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 definition of dead code; therefore I limited suspicious fragments to the items above that could plausibly hide dead operations or cause removal without effect in broader builds and so warrant further investigation."
