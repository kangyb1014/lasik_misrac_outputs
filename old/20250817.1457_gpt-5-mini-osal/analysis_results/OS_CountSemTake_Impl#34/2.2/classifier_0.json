  "scenario": "The macro '#define OS_SUCCESS (0)' is a preprocessor definition (compile-time token), not a runtime operation. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. A macro definition is not executed; if it is referenced it expands to a literal (0) and removal would either cause a compile error or require replacing it with an equivalent literal \u2014 the macro itself is not runtime dead code. Therefore this fragment does not violate Rule 2.2."
