  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the target function or the related definitions. The function only calls sem_wait and uses the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro to index into an array; OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx and does not perform any string handling. There are no uses of pointer arithmetic or string library functions that could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses of objects via string.h functions, so no code fragments need investigation under Rule 21.17."
