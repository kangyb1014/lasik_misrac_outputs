  "explanation": "I examined all pointer usages in the provided code and related definitions with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). None of the pointers present are missing a const qualification that could be applied without breaking required semantics:\n\n- Function parameter: const OS_object_token_t *token is already const-qualified, so no issue.\n\n- Local variable: OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl must be a non-const pointer because the code passes &impl->id to sem_wait(sem_t *), and sem_wait modifies the semaphore object. Making impl or its pointee const would prevent the required modification and is therefore not possible.\n\n- Macro usage: impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token); The macro returns &tbl[...], a pointer to the table element. The underlying table (OS_impl_count_sem_table) holds semaphores whose state is modified by semaphore operations; therefore the returned pointer must be non-const in contexts (like this one) that perform modifications. The index helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already accepts a const pointer (const OS_object_token_t *), so no const is being discarded in the call chain.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken signature: static inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token) is correctly const-qualified.\n\n- Global table: OS_impl_count_sem_table is an array of mutable semaphore records; making it const would be incorrect because semaphore operations change its contents.\n\nGiven these points, there are no code fragments in the provided code that should be flagged for possible missing const qualification under Rule 8.13. If additional code that reads but does not modify table entries exists elsewhere, those call sites could be reviewed to ensure they use pointers to const where applicable, but within the supplied code everything that must be mutable is correctly non-const and everything that can be const is const-qualified."
