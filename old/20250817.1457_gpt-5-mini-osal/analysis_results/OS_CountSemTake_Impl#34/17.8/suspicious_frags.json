  "explanation": "No code fragments modify the function parameter token. The function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token and there are no assignments to token (no statements like token = ...). The macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token) expands to take the address of the dereferenced token (effectively &(*token) which is equivalent to token) and is passed to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken as a const pointer; this does not alter the pointer parameter or the pointed-to object. The local variable impl is assigned from the table lookup, which does not modify the parameter. The subsequent sem_wait(&impl->id) operates on impl->id (an object from the table), not on token. Therefore there are no places in the shown code that violate Rule 17.8."
