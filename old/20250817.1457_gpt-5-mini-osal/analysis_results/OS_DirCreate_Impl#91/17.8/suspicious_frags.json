  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The parameters are:\n- local_path: declared as const char * and only used as an argument to mkdir() and stat(); there are no assignments, pointer arithmetic, or reassignments to local_path in the function. Passing the pointer to these library calls does not modify the parameter itself (and these POSIX interfaces accept const char *). Modifying the object pointed to would be allowed by the rule, but no such modification occurs here.\n- access: a uint32 parameter that is not used or assigned to anywhere in the function.\nBecause there are no assignments to either parameter, no pointer reassignments, and no other operations that alter the parameters, there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and thus nothing to flag for investigation."
