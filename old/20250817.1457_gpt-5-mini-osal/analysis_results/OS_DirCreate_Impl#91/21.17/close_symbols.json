  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about use of <string.h> functions you must confirm that no string-handling function can be invoked with an invalid/oversized pointer or length from this code path. The required symbols and why they are needed: \n\n- local_path (const char *): the pointer passed into mkdir/stat \u2014 need its provenance, expected null-termination and any preconditions to determine whether any string function (directly or inside called routines) could read beyond its bounds.\n- mkdir (prototype and platform/libc implementation): the callsite here is mkdir(local_path, ...). To prove no string function bound violation you must inspect the mkdir declaration and, if necessary, its implementation (or platform wrapper) to see whether it uses string.h functions on the passed pointer and whether it bounds-checks safely.\n- stat (prototype and platform/libc implementation): stat(local_path, &st) is used in the error path. Same reasoning as mkdir \u2014 examine declaration/implementation for any string operations on local_path.\n- errno and EEXIST: needed to understand the error-handling branch taken; knowing exact error constants and errno semantics ensures correct control-flow analysis (i.e., whether stat will be called).\n- struct stat and S_ISDIR: to verify that the code inspects st.st_mode correctly and that no string functions are involved in interpreting the stat result.\n- S_IFDIR, S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, S_IRWXO and mode_t: these are the mode flags and type passed to mkdir; while not directly string-related, include them to fully understand the mkdir call-site and any platform-specific behavior tied to mode handling.\n- int32 and uint32 typedefs, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: needed to understand return semantics and whether any wrapper macros/functions might expand to code that invokes string functions or change control flow relevant to the rule.\n- <sys/stat.h> and <errno.h>: header definitions that supply many of the above macros/types (S_ISDIR, struct stat, errno constants) \u2014 include to ensure correct macro definitions on the target platform.\n- Any platform-specific wrappers (e.g., OS-provided mkdir/stat wrappers): if the build uses OS-specific wrappers instead of libc functions, those implementations must be inspected for string.h usage.\n\nIn short: inspect the pointer (local_path), and every called routine or wrapper that could operate on that pointer (mkdir, stat, or their platform wrappers). Also include errno/constants and struct/macro definitions to understand control flow and data interpretation. These symbols are sufficient to determine whether any string.h functions could be invoked on local_path and whether such calls could access beyond its bounds."
