  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in this function. The code only calls mkdir and stat (and uses errno and macros like S_ISDIR/S_IFDIR), which are not string.h functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for potential out-of-bounds accesses as required by Rule 21.17. (Note: correctness of the path string passed to mkdir/stat \u2014 e.g. null-termination \u2014 is not handled by this rule and would need to be checked elsewhere if relevant.)"
