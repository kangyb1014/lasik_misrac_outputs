The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. The target function contains no for statements, so there are no for-loop clauses to analyze against the MISRA rule. The static call graph also shows OS_DirCreate_Impl has no callees to inspect for being part of a for-loop body. Standard library calls used (mkdir, stat) and macros/identifiers referenced (errno, EEXIST, S_ISDIR, S_IFDIR, S_IRWXU/G/O, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS, int32, uint32, struct stat) are not part of any for statement in this function; the MISRA rule about well-formed for loops would only require additional symbols if the target function contained for loops or had callees that are executed as part of a for-loop body. Since neither is present, no extra symbols are needed."
