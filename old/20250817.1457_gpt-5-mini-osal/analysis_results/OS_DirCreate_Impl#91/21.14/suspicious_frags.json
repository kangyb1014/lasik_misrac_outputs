  "explanation": "The provided function and related symbol definitions contain no calls to memcmp, no macros wrapping or aliasing memcmp, and no uses of memcmp-like byte-wise comparisons on null-terminated strings. The code only calls mkdir, stat and uses errno and S_ISDIR on the path; none of these are violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
