  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could be const-qualified. In the provided function the only pointer occurrences are:\n- the parameter local_path declared as const char * \u2014 already const-qualified, so compliant;\n- the use of &st passed to stat \u2014 stat fills in the struct, so the pointer must be to a non-const struct stat (cannot be const-qualified);\n- calls to mkdir and stat accept a const char * for the path (local_path matches that).\nThere are no other pointer variables or pointer parameters in this fragment that could be made const. Therefore there are no code fragments here that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
