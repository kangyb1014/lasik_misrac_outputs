  "explanation": "- mkdir (prototype): needed to confirm the parameter types (specifically that the path parameter is declared as const char *). This establishes whether passing local_path respects/needs const qualification.\n- stat (prototype): needed to confirm the first parameter is const char * and the second is struct stat * (non-const). This shows whether &st is correctly non-const and whether stat requires/accepts const for the path.\n- struct stat (definition): needed to inspect the fields (e.g., st_mode) and types to ensure the object passed to stat is non-const where required and to understand any const-related implications.\n- S_ISDIR (macro): needed to see how st_mode is used (no pointer const issues expected, but needed to complete analysis of st usage and ensure no implicit pointer-to-non-const conversions).\n- errno (declaration): needed to confirm errno is an lvalue integer (not a pointer) and how it is used in comparisons (to rule out any pointer constness concerns).\n- EEXIST (macro): needed to confirm the error value compared against errno; included for completeness of the errno-related branch analysis.\n\nThese symbols (typically defined in <sys/stat.h> and <errno.h>) provide the function signatures and type definitions required to determine whether any pointer parameters in the function should be const-qualified or violate the MISRA rule."
