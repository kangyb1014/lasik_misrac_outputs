  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The items inspected and reasons they are not flagged:\n- Function declaration/definition (void UT_ClearDeferredRetcode(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)): standard C function prototype/definition; UT_EntryKey_t is a typedef (not a language extension).\n- Pointer declaration (UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr): standard C pointer/typedef usage.\n- while (true): use of the boolean literal true is standard when stdbool.h is used (C99 and later). It is not a compiler extension by itself. If the project provides its own macro named true, that is a project macro, not a compiler language extension; such a case would need review of headers but does not constitute a compiler extension.\n- NULL: standard macro for null pointer constant.\n- Function calls and macro-like identifiers (UT_GetStubEntry, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_DEFERRED, UT_ClearStubEntry): these are project symbols/macros, not compiler language extensions.\n- break statement and control flow: standard C.\n\nThere are no uses of well-known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions, pragmas specific to a compiler, calling-convention keywords (e.g., __stdcall), inline assembler, or other vendor-specific tokens. Therefore no suspicious fragments to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
