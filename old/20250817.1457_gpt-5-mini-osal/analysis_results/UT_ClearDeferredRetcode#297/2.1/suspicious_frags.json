  "explanation": "The rest of the function (the prototype 'void UT_ClearDeferredRetcode(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey)', the local declaration 'UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;', and the call 'StubPtr = UT_GetStubEntry(...)') are not themselves indications of unreachable code: the declaration and prototype are required and do not contain executable paths, and the assignment from UT_GetStubEntry is the loop-driving operation whose return value determines control flow. The only constructs that can create unreachable code in this snippet are the infinite-loop control structure and the internal branch/termination (break) and the subsequent call inside the loop, so those are highlighted for investigation. No other lines in the function present obvious unreachable-code concerns that warrant separate investigation."
