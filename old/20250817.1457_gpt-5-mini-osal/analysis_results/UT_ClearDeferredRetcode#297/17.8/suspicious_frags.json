  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies the parameter FuncKey. The function only uses FuncKey as a value argument in the call UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, ...). There are no assignments to FuncKey, no increments/decrements, no taking of its address (&FuncKey) that could allow another routine to modify the parameter variable, and no pointer parameter is being reassigned. The only local variable modified is StubPtr, which is not a function parameter. Therefore, there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
