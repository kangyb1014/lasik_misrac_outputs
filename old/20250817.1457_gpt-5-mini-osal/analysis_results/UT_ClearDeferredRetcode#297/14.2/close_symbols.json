Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each requested symbol (concise):\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry: The loop condition depends on the return value of this function. To determine whether the loop-control expression has persistent side effects or whether it reads/modifies any loop control objects, the implementation of UT_GetStubEntry must be inspected.\n\n- UT_ClearStubEntry: Called from the loop body. Per the MISRA rule the behaviour of called functions is part of the loop body; UT_ClearStubEntry must be analyzed to ensure it does not modify any loop-control objects or introduce side effects that would make a for-loop malformed (or would affect an enclosing loop counter if the code were converted to a for-loop).\n\n- UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETVAL_CONFIG_DEFERRED: This constant/enum value is passed into UT_GetStubEntry and could influence which internal data structures are read. Its definition may change which global objects are accessed; hence it must be known.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t: The type of FuncKey may indicate whether it is an integer loop counter, an alias to a global, or some object that UT_GetStubEntry or UT_ClearStubEntry can modify. Knowing the type is necessary to check whether the loop condition depends on a modifiable object.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t: The pointer type returned by UT_GetStubEntry and consumed by UT_ClearStubEntry. The structure fields reveal whether the pointer aliases global state (e.g., contains back-pointers, reference counts) that could be modified by called functions and thereby affect loop control.\n\n- true (boolean macro / stdbool.h): The loop uses while(true). Knowing how true is defined (boolean literal, macro, or integer) is necessary to reason about the loop and whether any conversion/side-effects are possible (and to compare to the MISRA notion of loop control flags).\n\n- NULL: The code compares StubPtr to NULL. Definition/semantics of NULL in the codebase (pointer constant) is needed to ensure the comparison is a pure check and not overloaded by macros.\n\n- UT_StubTable (internal stub storage): Any global/static data structures that UT_GetStubEntry reads (e.g., the stub table) must be inspected because the MISRA rule forbids using objects in the loop control that are modified in the loop body. If UT_ClearStubEntry modifies the same global storage, that could make a for-loop non-conforming.\n\n- UT_StubCount (any counters used by the stub subsystem): If UT_GetStubEntry uses counters or indexes (global/static) to find entries, and UT_ClearStubEntry updates them, those are potential loop-control objects. Include representative counters/indices used by the subsystem.\n\n- Any global or static objects read/written by UT_GetStubEntry/UT_ClearStubEntry: A general catch-all to ensure all shared state (flags, counters, tables, indices) accessed by either function is examined for read/write interactions that could violate the MISRA for-loop requirements when those functions are considered part of the loop body.\n\n- Any functions called by UT_GetStubEntry: If UT_GetStubEntry itself calls other functions, those callee behaviours become part of the loop-condition evaluation (they may have side-effects). All such callees must be available for analysis.\n\n- Any functions called by UT_ClearStubEntry: Likewise, callees of UT_ClearStubEntry are part of the loop body; their side-effects could modify loop-control objects and must be analyzed.\n\nSummary: To decide whether the target function violates the MISRA rule about well-formed for loops (in particular whether called functions produce side-effects on loop-control objects), you must examine the implementations and all global/state symbols used by UT_GetStubEntry and UT_ClearStubEntry, plus the type and constants used in the call and the boolean/pointer macros used by the loop."
