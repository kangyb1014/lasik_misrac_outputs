  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree:\n```c\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    uint32              max_id;\n    uint32              base_id;\n    uint32              local_id = 0;\n    uint32              serial;\n    uint32              i;\n    int32               return_code;\n    OS_common_record_t *obj = NULL;\n    OS_objtype_state_t *objtype_state;\n\n    base_id       = OS_GetBaseForObjectType(token->obj_type);\n    max_id        = OS_GetMaxForObjectType(token->obj_type);\n    objtype_state = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type];\n\n    if (max_id == 0)\n    {\n        /* if the max id is zero, then this build of OSAL\n         * does not include any support for that object type.\n         * Return the \"not implemented\" to differentiate between\n         * this case vs. running out of valid slots  */\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED;\n        serial      = 0;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS;\n        serial      = OS_ObjectIdToSerialNumber_Impl(objtype_state->last_id_issued);\n    }\n\n    for (i = 0; i < max_id; ++i)\n    {\n        local_id = (++serial) % max_id;\n        if (serial >= OS_OBJECT_INDEX_MASK)\n        {\n            /* reset to beginning of ID space */\n            serial = local_id;\n        }\n        obj = &OS_common_table[local_id + base_id];\n        if (!OS_ObjectIdDefined(obj->active_id))\n        {\n            return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        token->obj_idx = OSAL_INDEX_C(local_id);\n        OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl(token->obj_type, serial, &token->obj_id);\n\n        /* Ensure any data in the record has been cleared */\n        obj->active_id  = token->obj_id;\n        obj->name_entry = NULL;\n        obj->creator    = OS_TaskGetId();\n        obj->refcount   = 0;\n\n        /* preemptively update the last id issued */\n        objtype_state->last_id_issued = token->obj_id;\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        token->obj_idx = OSAL_INDEX_C(-1);\n        token->obj_id  = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree:\nstatic inline bool OS_ObjectIdDefined(osal_id_t object_id)\n{\n    return (OS_ObjectIdToInteger(object_id) != 0);\n}\n...\nstatic OS_common_record_t OS_common_table[OS_MAX_TOTAL_RECORDS]\n...\ntypedef struct OS_common_record OS_common_record_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_INDEX_MASK 0xFFFF\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nuint32              local_id = 0;\nuint32              serial;\nuint32              i;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The for loop uses a single loop counter i (declared above), initialized in the first clause (i = 0), tested only against max_id (which is not modified in the loop body), and incremented in the third clause (++i). The body modifies other objects (local_id, serial, obj) but does not modify i. Thus the for loop meets the requirements of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2."
