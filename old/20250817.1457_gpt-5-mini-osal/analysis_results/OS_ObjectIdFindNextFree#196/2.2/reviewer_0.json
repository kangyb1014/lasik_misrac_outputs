After this point the for-loop (for (i = 0; i < max_id; ++i)) is skipped because max_id is 0, and the success path that would use 'serial' (OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl and related assignments) is not taken because return_code != OS_SUCCESS. Therefore the assignment serial = 0 has no effect on program behaviour and could be removed without changing the program. This constitutes dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void osal_probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1570.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (fp == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(fp, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n    fprintf(fp, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(fp);\n}\n\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    uint32              max_id;\n    uint32              base_id;\n    uint32              local_id = 0;\n    uint32              serial;\n    uint32              i;\n    int32               return_code;\n    OS_common_record_t *obj = NULL;\n    OS_objtype_state_t *objtype_state;\n\n    /* Log entry and input token state */\n    osal_probe_log(\"ENTRY: OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree token=%p obj_type=%u\", (void *)token, (unsigned)token->obj_type);\n\n    base_id       = OS_GetBaseForObjectType(token->obj_type);\n    max_id        = OS_GetMaxForObjectType(token->obj_type);\n    objtype_state = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type];\n\n    /* Log retrieved base/max and last_id_issued */\n    osal_probe_log(\"LOOKUP: base_id=%u max_id=%u objtype_state=%p last_id_issued=0x%08x\",\n                   (unsigned)base_id, (unsigned)max_id, (void *)objtype_state,\n                   (unsigned)objtype_state->last_id_issued);\n\n    if (max_id == 0)\n    {\n        /* if the max id is zero, then this build of OSAL\n         * does not include any support for that object type.\n         * Return the \"not implemented\" to differentiate between\n         * this case vs. running out of valid slots  */\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED;\n        serial      = 0;\n\n        /* Probe log: record the assignment that is the subject of the reported dead-code */\n        osal_probe_log(\"BRANCH: max_id==0 -> return_code=%d serial_assigned=%u (loop will be skipped)\",\n                       (int)return_code, (unsigned)serial);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS;\n        serial      = OS_ObjectIdToSerialNumber_Impl(objtype_state->last_id_issued);\n\n        osal_probe_log(\"BRANCH: max_id>0 -> return_code=%d initial_serial=%u\",\n                       (int)return_code, (unsigned)serial);\n    }\n\n    /* Log before entering loop (or skipping it) */\n    osal_probe_log(\"LOOP_BEGIN: max_id=%u serial=%u\", (unsigned)max_id, (unsigned)serial);\n\n    for (i = 0; i < max_id; ++i)\n    {\n        local_id = (++serial) % max_id;\n        if (serial >= OS_OBJECT_INDEX_MASK)\n        {\n            /* reset to beginning of ID space */\n            serial = local_id;\n        }\n        obj = &OS_common_table[local_id + base_id];\n\n        /* Log each iteration's indices and active state for reproducibility */\n        osal_probe_log(\"ITER: i=%u serial=%u local_id=%u check_active_id=0x%08x\",\n                       (unsigned)i, (unsigned)serial, (unsigned)local_id, (unsigned)obj->active_id);\n\n        if (!OS_ObjectIdDefined(obj->active_id))\n        {\n            return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            osal_probe_log(\"FOUND_FREE: i=%u local_id=%u serial=%u -> return_code=OS_SUCCESS\",\n                           (unsigned)i, (unsigned)local_id, (unsigned)serial);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        token->obj_idx = OSAL_INDEX_C(local_id);\n        OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl(token->obj_type, serial, &token->obj_id);\n\n        /* Ensure any data in the record has been cleared */\n        obj->active_id  = token->obj_id;\n        obj->name_entry = NULL;\n        obj->creator    = OS_TaskGetId();\n        obj->refcount   = 0;\n\n        /* preemptively update the last id issued */\n        objtype_state->last_id_issued = token->obj_id;\n\n        osal_probe_log(\"SUCCESS_ASSIGN: token->obj_idx=%d token->obj_id=0x%08x obj=%p\",\n                       (int)token->obj_idx, (unsigned)token->obj_id, (void *)obj);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        token->obj_idx = OSAL_INDEX_C(-1);\n        token->obj_id  = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED;\n\n        /* Log failure path and final token state */\n        osal_probe_log(\"FAIL_PATH: return_code=%d token->obj_idx=%d token->obj_id=0x%08x\",\n                       (int)return_code, (int)token->obj_idx, (unsigned)token->obj_id);\n    }\n\n    osal_probe_log(\"EXIT: return_code=%d\", (int)return_code);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree.

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. When max_id == 0 the code takes the if branch setting return_code = OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED and executes serial = 0. Because max_id is zero the for-loop is skipped and return_code != OS_SUCCESS, so none of the later code paths that use serial (e.g. OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl) are taken. The assignment to serial therefore has no effect on observable program behaviour \u2014 removing it would not change the program \u2014 which meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note: if serial were volatile or had other side effects, the conclusion might differ; in this code it does not.)"
