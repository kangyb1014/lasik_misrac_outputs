This assignment is never relied upon: when max_id > 0 the for-loop assigns 'obj' before any use, and when max_id == 0 the loop is skipped and the block that would dereference 'obj' is not executed. Therefore the initialization has no effect on program behavior and can be removed \u2014 it is an executed operation qualifying as dead code.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1570.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list args;\n    va_start(args, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, args);\n    va_end(args);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    uint32              max_id;\n    uint32              base_id;\n    uint32              local_id = 0;\n    uint32              serial;\n    uint32              i;\n    int32               return_code;\n    OS_common_record_t *obj = NULL;\n    OS_objtype_state_t *objtype_state;\n\n    /* Log entry and initial ptr state to demonstrate the initialization value */\n    OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree_log(\"Entry: token=%p, obj_type=%u, initial_obj=%p\", (void *)token, (unsigned)token->obj_type, (void *)obj);\n\n    base_id       = OS_GetBaseForObjectType(token->obj_type);\n    max_id        = OS_GetMaxForObjectType(token->obj_type);\n    objtype_state = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type];\n\n    OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree_log(\"Computed base_id=%u, max_id=%u, objtype_state=%p\", (unsigned)base_id, (unsigned)max_id, (void *)objtype_state);\n\n    if (max_id == 0)\n    {\n        /* if the max id is zero, then this build of OSAL\n         * does not include any support for that object type.\n         * Return the \"not implemented\" to differentiate between\n         * this case vs. running out of valid slots  */\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED;\n        serial      = 0;\n\n        OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree_log(\"Branch: max_id==0 -> return_code=%d, serial=%u\", (int)return_code, (unsigned)serial);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS;\n        serial      = OS_ObjectIdToSerialNumber_Impl(objtype_state->last_id_issued);\n\n        OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree_log(\"Branch: max_id>0 -> initial return_code=%d, initial serial=%u (last_id_issued=0x%08x)\",\n                                   (int)return_code, (unsigned)serial, (unsigned)objtype_state->last_id_issued);\n    }\n\n    for (i = 0;

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead code, but its Note 3 explicitly states that initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and \u201cis therefore not a candidate for dead code.\u201d Although the initializer OS_common_record_t *obj = NULL; is executed and removing it would not change the observed behaviour of this function (the pointer is assigned before any dereference on the success path and not dereferenced on the failure path), MISRA explicitly excludes initializations from being treated as dead code. Therefore the agent\u2019s claim that this specific initialization constitutes a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
