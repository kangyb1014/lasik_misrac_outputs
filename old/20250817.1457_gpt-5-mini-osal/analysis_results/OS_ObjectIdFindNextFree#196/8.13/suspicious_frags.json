  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. Analysis of all pointer usages in OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree: \n\n- Function parameter: OS_object_token_t *token \u2014 the function writes to token->obj_idx and token->obj_id, so the pointer cannot be const.\n- Local pointer: OS_common_record_t *obj \u2014 the function assigns obj = &OS_common_table[...] and later writes obj->active_id, obj->name_entry, obj->creator and obj->refcount, so it must remain non-const.\n- Local pointer: OS_objtype_state_t *objtype_state \u2014 objtype_state is used to read last_id_issued initially and later to update objtype_state->last_id_issued, so it cannot be const.\n- Calls that take pointers: OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl(..., osal_id_t *result) writes via *result, so that parameter must be non-const.\n- Global data: OS_common_table and the objtype state array are modified by this routine, so pointers into them must be non-const.\n\nNo other pointer parameters or local pointers exist that are only used for read-only access and could be const-qualified. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that should be investigated for possible missing const qualification under Rule 8.13."
