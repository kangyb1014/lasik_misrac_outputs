  "explanation": "I found no use of memcmp in this function. There are no string buffers, no char* comparisons, and no calls in this code fragment that perform a direct memory comparison of null-terminated strings. The code only manipulates integers, indices, and a few pointer assignments (e.g., obj->name_entry = NULL), none of which involve memcmp or comparing null-terminated strings. \n\nNote: this function does call other helper functions (OS_GetBaseForObjectType, OS_GetMaxForObjectType, OS_ObjectIdToSerialNumber_Impl, OS_ObjectIdCompose_Impl, OS_TaskGetId). If you need full MISRA Rule 21.14 coverage for the whole module, those called functions should be inspected separately for any use of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings. However, within the provided code fragment itself there are no occurrences that require investigation for Rule 21.14."
