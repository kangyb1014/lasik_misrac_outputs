  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in OS_BinSemDelete_Impl that are statically unreachable (i.e., cannot be executed under any feasible program flow). Reasoning: - The assignment sem = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is reachable at function entry; the macro expands to an array reference using the token index and, with the passed argument *token, the &(tok) expansion becomes &(*token) which yields the original token pointer \u2014 not a compile-time constant that would make that statement unreachable. - The if/else branches are both potentially reachable at runtime depending on the return value of pthread_cond_destroy; the else branch (which contains pthread_mutex_destroy) is therefore not unreachable. - There is no code after the final return statement, and no infinite loops or other control-flow constructs that render subsequent statements unreachable. - Unused struct members (flush_request, current_value) are not unreachable code \u2014 they are simply unused data. - No preprocessor or compile-time constant decisions in the provided fragments produce dead code. Thus there are no fragments that must be flagged under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 in the supplied function. If you want, I can further check for related issues (e.g., potential undefined behavior if token is NULL, or error handling of pthread_* return values) but those are not instances of unreachable code."
