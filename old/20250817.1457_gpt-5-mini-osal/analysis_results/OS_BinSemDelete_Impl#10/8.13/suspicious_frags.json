  "explanation": "I reviewed all pointer uses in OS_BinSemDelete_Impl and the related definitions. The function parameter token is already const-qualified (const OS_object_token_t *token). The local pointer sem points into the global OS_impl_bin_sem_table and is used to call pthread_cond_destroy(&sem->cv) and pthread_mutex_destroy(&sem->id); these POSIX APIs require pointers to modifiable pthread_cond_t / pthread_mutex_t objects, so sem cannot be a pointer-to-const. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro ultimately yields &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))], and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const OS_object_token_t*; passing *token leads to &(*token) which is the original const pointer, so const-correctness is preserved for the index lookup. The global array OS_impl_bin_sem_table and the volatile fields in the record are inherently mutable in this context. Therefore there are no obvious places where a pointer should be changed to point to a const-qualified type; no fragments require investigation for Rule 8.13."
