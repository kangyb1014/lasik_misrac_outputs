  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BinSemDelete_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_BinSemDelete_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem;\n    int32                             return_code;\n\n    sem = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_bin_sem_table, *token);\n\n    if (pthread_cond_destroy(&(sem->cv)) != 0)\n    {\n        /* sem could be busy, i.e. some task is pending on it already.\n         * that means it cannot be deleted at this time. */\n        return_code = OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Now that the CV is destroyed this sem is unusable,\n         * so we must do our best to clean everything else.

  "scenario": "The call to pthread_mutex_destroy(&(sem->id)) has observable side-effects (releases OS/thread-library resources and changes the mutex state). Removing it would alter resource management and potentially synchronization behaviour (e.g. leak resources, leave a mutex initialized for reuse), so the operation is not dead code."
