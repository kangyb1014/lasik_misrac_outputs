  "explanation": "No code fragments modify the function parameter token itself. The parameter is only dereferenced (sem = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token)), which reads the object referred to and does not assign to or change the pointer variable token. There are no assignments to token, no pointer arithmetic on token, and token is not passed to any function that could modify the pointer variable. The subsequent calls (pthread_cond_destroy, pthread_mutex_destroy) operate on the local sem object, not on token. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET use takes *token (the value) rather than token, so the macro cannot alter the token pointer itself. Therefore nothing in this function appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and there are no suspicious fragments to investigate."
