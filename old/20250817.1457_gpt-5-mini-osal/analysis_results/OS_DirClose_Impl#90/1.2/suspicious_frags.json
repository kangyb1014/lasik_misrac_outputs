  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code fragments. Specific notes: \n- The function OS_DirClose_Impl uses only standard C constructs (variable declaration, assignment, function call, pointer nulling, return). There are no __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}) in macros, nested functions, or other known compiler-specific constructs.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))], which uses standard preprocessor substitution, array indexing and the address-of operator. Although it takes the address of the macro parameter expression, this is valid standard C when the expression is an lvalue (e.g., &(*token) in the call), and it does not rely on a compiler extension.\n- Use of closedir and DIR are POSIX library interfaces, not language/compiler extensions; their use does not violate Rule 1.2 (which targets compiler language extensions).\n- The extern array declaration, typedefs, struct definition, and the NULL/OS_SUCCESS constants are all standard C and do not involve compiler-specific extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
