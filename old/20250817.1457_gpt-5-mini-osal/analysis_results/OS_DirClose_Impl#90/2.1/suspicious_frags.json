  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function are syntactically or statically unreachable. The function has a single straight-line control flow: obtain impl via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, call closedir(impl->dp), set impl->dp = NULL, then return OS_SUCCESS. There are no conditional branches, loops, multiple returns, or statements after a return that would create dead/unreachable code. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))], which is equivalent to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token)] in this usage, so it does not introduce unreachable code. Possible runtime issues (e.g. out-of-bounds index, closedir behaving non-returning, or incomplete type definition elsewhere) are not instances of unreachable code per MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 and therefore do not warrant reporting as unreachable-code fragments."
