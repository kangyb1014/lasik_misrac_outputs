  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I found no for statements in the provided function OS_DirClose_Impl, nor in the related inline function or macro fragments you supplied. Specifically:\n- OS_DirClose_Impl contains only a table lookup via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, a call to closedir(), a pointer assignment, and a return; there is no for loop.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an array index expression (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) and contains no for loop.\n- The inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx (no loop).\n- The type and table declarations and the struct definition contain no for loops.\n- The only function call in the function is closedir(), which is an external/library call; any internal loops inside library code are outside the provided source and therefore outside the scope of inspection here.\n\nBecause Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for loops and there are no for loops in the supplied code or related fragments, there are no code fragments to flag for investigation under this rule."
