  "explanation": "The function parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' is already const-qualified and does not need investigation. The OS_impl_dir_table array is declared as a non-const global and the code modifies its contents (impl->dp is assigned NULL and passed to closedir), so non-const pointers to its elements may be required; these modifications justify non-const qualification for the table element in normal use. The DIR * member (impl->dp) is both used by closedir and later cleared (set to NULL), so it cannot be made a pointer-to-const. No other pointer objects appear in the provided function body that could obviously be const-qualified without preventing the observed modifications."
