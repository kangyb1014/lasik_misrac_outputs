  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. impl->dp has type DIR * which is required by closedir(impl->dp) (closedir expects a DIR * and may modify the DIR object), and the statement impl->dp = NULL modifies the pointer itself (not the pointed-to object). Making the pointed-to type const (const DIR *) would be incompatible with closedir, and making the pointer itself const would prevent assigning NULL. Therefore Rule 8.13 does not apply here. (A violation would occur if the pointer allowed modification of an object that should be immutable but was not declared to point to a const-qualified type.)"
