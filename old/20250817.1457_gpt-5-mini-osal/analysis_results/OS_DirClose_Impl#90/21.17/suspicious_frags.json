  "explanation": "The code contains no direct calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The remaining statements (closedir(impl->dp); impl->dp = NULL; return OS_SUCCESS;) do not invoke or imply use of those string-handling functions, so they do not need investigation for this rule. The only statement that could indirectly expand to or call string functions is the macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) \u2014 its expansion may perform table lookups or copies that could use string.h functions, so that line should be investigated further."
