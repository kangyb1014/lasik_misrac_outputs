  "explanation": "Other parts of the function were not selected because they do not introduce non-const pointer usages or are already const-qualified: the function parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token (already const-qualified), the local variable 'status' is not a pointer, and the pthread_cleanup_pop(false) call does not involve pointer types. The comment block and return statements do not affect pointer const-qualification. The listed fragments are the locations where pointers or addresses to non-const objects are obtained/used and therefore merit investigation for compliance with Rule 8.13."
