  "scenario": "The pointer 'impl' is used to modify or pass non-const members (e.g. &impl->mut to pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cond_wait which require a non-const pthread_mutex_t*), so it cannot be const-qualified. Therefore assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET to a non-const OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t * is appropriate and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
