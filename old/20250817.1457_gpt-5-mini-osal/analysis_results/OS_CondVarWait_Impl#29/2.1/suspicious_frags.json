  "explanation": "The following items from the surrounding code are NOT included for investigation because they are not candidates for static unreachable code: the function signature and local declarations (int status; OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl;) are executed when the function is entered; the assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token); expands to a valid table access via OS_ObjectIndexFromToken and is syntactically reachable from the function entry; the macro and inline helper definitions provided (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) and the structure/type definitions are not themselves unreachable code \u2014 they are used by the function at runtime. The helper OS_Posix_CondVarReleaseMutex and the OS_ERROR/OS_SUCCESS macros are referenced and therefore not statically unreachable. The reason to flag the pthread_cleanup_push/cond_wait/cleanup_pop block and the subsequent returns is that pthread_cond_wait is a pthread cancellation point and the cleanup handler interacts with control flow in a way that may cause portions of the function not to execute in certain runtime cancellation scenarios; these areas merit investigation to confirm there is no statically unreachable code or inconsistent use of the push/pop macros. Other single-line statements and declarations outside the listed fragments are straightforward and reachable when the function executes, so they do not require investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1."
