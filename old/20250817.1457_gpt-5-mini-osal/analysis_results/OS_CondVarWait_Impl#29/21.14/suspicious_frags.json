  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_CondVarWait_Impl and the additional related symbols. There are no calls to memcmp or any other string-comparison functions in the shown code. The function only uses pthread APIs (pthread_cleanup_push, pthread_cond_wait, pthread_cleanup_pop) and returns status codes; the helper OS_Posix_CondVarReleaseMutex calls pthread_mutex_unlock, and the inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns a numeric index from the token. No null-terminated string objects are compared, and no string.h functions (memcmp, strcmp, etc.) appear in the fragments you supplied. Therefore there are no code fragments here that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If you want exhaustive verification, provide the definitions of macros/functions not shown (for example OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and any other macros or functions referenced) so they can be checked for any hidden memcmp usage."
