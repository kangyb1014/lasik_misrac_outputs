  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CondVarWait_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CondVarWait_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int                                status;\n    OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n     * note that because pthread_cond_wait is a cancellation point, this needs to\n     * employ the same protection that is in the binsem module.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The array OS_impl_condvar_table is referenced by OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET from OS_CondVarWait_Impl (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);), so it is used at runtime. Removing the definition would change program behaviour (accesses to the table would become invalid). Therefore this is not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
