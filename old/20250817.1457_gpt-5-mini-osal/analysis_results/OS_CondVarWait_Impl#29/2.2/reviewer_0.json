  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. In the original code the macro invocation is used in an assignment: impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...); \u2014 it is not a standalone expression-statement whose result is discarded. The computed address/value stored in impl is subsequently dereferenced (impl->mut, impl->cv) and used in pthread_cond_wait and pthread_cleanup_push; removing the assignment would change program behaviour. Therefore this is not dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If the macro were instead written or used as a standalone expression with no side-effects then that would be a different matter, but that is not the case in the provided code.)"
