  "explanation": "1) osal_priority_t (typedef/definition): Needed to know the underlying type of the InputPri parameter. If osal_priority_t were a pointer type or an aggregate with hidden indirection, modifying the object referred-to vs the parameter itself would be different for MISRA C rule checking. Confirming it is an integral (by-value) type shows whether assignments to the parameter would violate the rule. \n\n2) OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY (macro/constant definition): The function compares and computes with InputPri against this symbol. Its definition/type is required to determine the actual comparison/conversion semantics (integral width/signedness) and to ensure no macro hides side effects that could write to InputPri. \n\n3) POSIX_GlobalVars (global variable) - its declaration/type/definition: The function reads fields from this global. You must confirm this identifier is a plain global object (not a macro/function or alias) and inspect its type to ensure accesses here cannot cause aliasing or hidden modifications to the parameter. This rules out indirect modifications via macros or unusual operator overloads (if any). \n\n4) POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits (struct/type) and fields PriorityMax, PriorityMin (definitions): Needed to verify these fields are ordinary scalar members (no macros or accessors with side effects) and to check their types for the arithmetic performed. This ensures field accesses and arithmetic cannot implicitly modify InputPri and that there are no hidden assignments that would contravene the MISRA rule."
