  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter InputPri. The parameter is only read in comparisons and expressions (if (InputPri == 0), else if (InputPri >= ...), and in the arithmetic expression where it is cast to int: (int)InputPri). There are no assignments to InputPri and no pointer parameters in this function (so the pointer-related part of Rule 17.8 is not applicable). All assignments are to the local variable OutputPri or to/from global read-only fields; thus no violation of \"a function parameter should not be modified\" is present in the provided code."
