  "explanation": "I reviewed the function and the related symbol definitions. There are no compiler-specific language extensions present that would trigger MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2. Specifically:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or builtins are used (e.g. __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, __label__ etc.).\n- No inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used by GCC, or nested functions are present.\n- The typedef to uint8_t is a standard fixed-width integer type (C99/stdint.h), not a compiler extension.\n- Use of static, extern, casts, integer arithmetic, and preprocessor macros are all standard C constructs.\n- No vendor-specific pragmas or nonstandard initializers are used.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that should be flagged for language-extension violations under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
