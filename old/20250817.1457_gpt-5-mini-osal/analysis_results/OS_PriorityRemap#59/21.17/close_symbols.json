  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (concise):\n\n- osal_priority_t\n  - Required to know the underlying type and range of InputPri so you can determine whether the comparisons (InputPri == 0, InputPri >= OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY) and the cast to (int) can hide any code which might call string functions via macros or produce undefined behaviour leading to memory access. Also needed to verify no implicit conversion causes unexpected behaviour.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY\n  - The function branches and arithmetic depend on this constant (and a runtime divisor uses OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY - 2). You must know its value and type to ensure the divisor is non-zero and to check that the arithmetic cannot overflow or underflow. Also needed to confirm that this macro is not a wrapper that expands to a function call invoking any string.h function.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars\n  - The function reads POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMax and PriorityMin. You must inspect the POSIX_GlobalVars symbol to confirm it is a plain global structure (not a macro that expands to a function call or an accessor that might call string functions) and to get its layout.\n\n- struct type of POSIX_GlobalVars (definition)\n  - Required to see the exact types of the PriLimits member and to ensure accessing PriorityMax/PriorityMin is a simple field access (no hidden function-like macro/operator) and to confirm there are no side-effecting accessor macros that could call string functions.\n\n- PriLimits member definition (type and names PriorityMax, PriorityMin)\n  - Needed to know the exact types, signedness, and ranges of PriorityMax and PriorityMin (e.g. int vs unsigned, limits). The arithmetic (subtraction, multiplication, addition, division) depends on these; you must ensure no integer overflow/underflow or unexpected promotion occurs that could in turn cause undefined behavior or hidden memory operations. Also verify these fields are not implemented as functions or macros.\n\n- declarations / range constraints for PriorityMax and PriorityMin (their valid numeric ranges and signedness)\n  - To evaluate whether expressions like (PriorityMax - PriorityMin) - 2 can be negative or overflow, and whether the final OutputPri stays within expected bounds. This is necessary to rule out any code paths that could indirectly cause out-of-bounds memory accesses elsewhere (even though this function itself does not call string functions).\n\n- underlying integer-width/type of PriorityMax/PriorityMin and of 'int' on target platform (e.g. int32_t)\n  - To reason precisely about integer promotions, overflow behavior, and whether casts (int)InputPri are safe. This is required to show that the function does not perform any operations that could trigger undefined behaviour that might mask or hide string.h usage via side effects.\n\nNotes: The target function contains no calls to any string.h functions itself. The symbols above are the minimal set needed to confirm that none of the referenced names are macros/indirections that expand to string-handling calls and to validate that the arithmetic cannot produce undefined behaviour that could be misinterpreted as a string API out-of-bounds usage. Callers listed in the call graph are not necessary to determine whether this function violates the <string.h> usage rule, unless those callers inject macros/types that change the meanings of the symbols listed above."
