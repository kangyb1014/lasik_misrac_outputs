  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) or any other <string.h> functions are present in the provided code. The function OS_PriorityRemap performs only integer comparisons, casts and arithmetic and returns an int; it does not perform any pointer-based string operations or pass object pointers to string.h functions. The referenced symbols (osal_priority_t as uint8_t, OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY, and POSIX_GlobalVars) are used only in comparisons and arithmetic and do not involve string handling. Therefore there are no fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 to investigate in this code."
