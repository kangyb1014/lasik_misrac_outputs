  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_PriorityRemap:\n```c\nstatic int OS_PriorityRemap(osal_priority_t InputPri)\n{\n    int OutputPri;\n\n    if (InputPri == 0)\n    {\n        /* use the \"MAX\" local priority only for OSAL tasks with priority=0 */\n        OutputPri = POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMax;\n    }\n    else if (InputPri >= OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY)\n    {\n        /* use the \"MIN\" local priority only for OSAL tasks with priority=255 */\n        OutputPri = POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMin;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * Spread the remainder of OSAL priorities over the remainder of local priorities\n         *\n         * Note OSAL priorities use the VxWorks style with zero being the\n         * highest and OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY being the lowest, this inverts it\n         */\n        OutputPri = (OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY - 1) - (int)InputPri;\n\n        OutputPri *= (POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMax - POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMin) - 2;\n        OutputPri += OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY / 2;\n        OutputPri /= (OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY - 2);\n        OutputPri += POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMin + 1;\n    }\n\n    return OutputPri;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nelse if (InputPri >= OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY)\n    {\n        /* use the \"MIN\" local priority only for OSAL tasks with priority=255 */\n        OutputPri = POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMin;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The else-if branch is taken when InputPri >= OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY and assigns OutputPri = POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMin. Removing this branch would change behavior for any InputPri values that are >= OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY, so it is not dead code. (Note: the comment implies the intent was for a single value (e.g. priority==255) while the test uses >=; this is a potential logic/comment mismatch but does not by itself make the code dead.)"
