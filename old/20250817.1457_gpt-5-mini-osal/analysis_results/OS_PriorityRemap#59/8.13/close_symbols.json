  "explanation": "To determine whether MISRA's \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\" is violated, the analyzer must confirm whether any of the identifiers used in OS_PriorityRemap are pointer types (and thus require const qualification). For each symbol:\n\n- osal_priority_t: need the typedef/underlying type to verify whether InputPri is a scalar or a pointer. If it's a pointer type, MISRA may require const qualification; if scalar, the rule does not apply.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: need the declaration of this global (is it an object or a pointer?) to know whether accesses (POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits...) involve dereferencing a pointer. If POSIX_GlobalVars is a pointer, its pointee type should be checked for possible const qualification.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits: need the definition/type of the PriLimits member to see whether it is an object or a pointer to a struct; if a pointer, that is relevant to the const-pointer rule.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMax and PriorityMin: need their declarations/types (are they integer fields or pointers?) to confirm whether they are pointers that would be subject to const qualification. Also used in arithmetic so their signedness/width may matter for casts but primarily we need to know pointer-ness.\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY: need the macro/constant definition to check its type/value (ensures arithmetic and casts are on scalars, not pointer-sized macros). If this were defined in a way that produces a pointer expression (unlikely but possible via macro), it would affect the pointer/const analysis.\n\nIf all of the above resolve to plain scalar/integer types and POSIX_GlobalVars is not a pointer, then no pointer-related MISRA const requirement applies to this function. If any are pointer types, their declarations are required to decide whether they should be const-qualified."
