  "explanation": "No pointer objects, pointer parameters, or pointer dereferences appear in the provided code fragment. The function parameter InputPri is an integral typedef (uint8_t), the extern declaration shown (extern POSIX_GlobalVars_t POSIX_GlobalVars) declares an object, not a pointer, and there are no casts to or from pointer types. The macros and arithmetic use integer types only. Therefore MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 (pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible) is not applicable to any code inside OS_PriorityRemap as presented. If the definition of POSIX_GlobalVars_t (not shown) contains pointer members, those member declarations should be checked in their own translation unit, but they are not present in the target code and thus are outside the scope of this fragment inspection."
