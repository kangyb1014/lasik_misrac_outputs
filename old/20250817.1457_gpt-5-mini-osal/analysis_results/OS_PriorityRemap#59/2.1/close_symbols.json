  "explanation": "- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY: The function branches on comparisons with this constant (InputPri >= OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY) and uses it in several arithmetic expressions (e.g. OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY - 1, / (OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY - 2)). Its compile-time value (and relation to 0,1,2,255, etc.) determines whether the second or else branches can ever be taken (e.g. if OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY <= 1 the else branch may be unreachable). Also needed to detect degenerate denominators that affect reachability of subsequent statements.\n\n- osal_priority_t: The InputPri parameter type (signed/unsigned width and range) determines the set of possible values the function can receive. If the typedef restricts values (for example an unsigned 8-bit range 0..255) some branches (InputPri == 0 or >= OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY) may be statically impossible or always true/false.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global variable instance is read for PriLimits; its declaration is required to find the types and any constness/compile-time values that could affect arithmetic or conditional logic.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits: The nested structure holding PriorityMax and PriorityMin; its definition is required to know types and (if statically initialised) possible values or constraints that might influence reachability (for example if PriorityMax==PriorityMin+1, some arithmetic might be degenerate).\n\n- PriorityMax and PriorityMin: The numeric limits used in the function (assignment in the InputPri==0 and InputPri>=OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY branches and in the else-branch arithmetic). Their values and ranges can affect whether code paths are meaningful or if certain computations collapse to constants, which can render subsequent statements unreachable in practice.\n\n- OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl and OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl (callers): To determine whether any branch is actually reachable in the program you must inspect the call sites: these callers may validate or normalize InputPri before calling OS_PriorityRemap (or only call it with a restricted subset of values), making some branches unreachable. Analyze their code to see what InputPri values they pass and whether they enforce preconditions that remove possibilities.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the constant, the input type, the global struct and its limit fields, and the immediate callers) provides the necessary information about the domain of InputPri and the relevant constant parameters so that a static analysis can decide if any branch (and thus any code) in OS_PriorityRemap is provably unreachable under the project's definitions and call patterns."
