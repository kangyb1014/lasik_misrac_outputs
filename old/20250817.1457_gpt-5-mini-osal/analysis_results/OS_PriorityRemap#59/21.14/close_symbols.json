  "explanation": "The target function contains no function calls (no direct use of memcmp), but to be certain there is no hidden/macro-expanded use of memcmp or other behavior that might relate to the MISRA rule, the following symbols are needed:\n\n- OS_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY: Macro used in the arithmetic/branching of the function. Needed to check whether it is defined in terms of other macros or inline expressions that could invoke or expand to library calls (e.g., via weird macro indirection).\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global variable referenced by the function. Its definition could include macros, inline functions, or initializer expressions that (unlikely but possibly) reference string comparison or memcmp; inspect its type and declaration to be sure.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits: The nested struct/union member type for PriLimits is required to locate the definitions of PriorityMax/Min and ensure they are simple integer members (not computed via functions/macros that could call memcmp).\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.PriLimits.PriorityMax and PriorityMin: The actual members read by the function. Confirm they are plain integers and not accessor macros or functions that might perform string comparisons.\n- osal_priority_t: The typedef/type of InputPri. Needed to confirm it is an integer type (no overloaded semantics or macro that could hide a call to memcmp).\n\nNote: The function has no callees, so there is no direct place where memcmp could be called from inside this function. The above symbols ensure there is no hidden/macroed use of memcmp via macros, accessors, or atypical definitions of the referenced globals/types."
