  "explanation": "1) OS_object_token_t: The MISRA rule being checked concerns whether pointer parameters should point to const-qualified data whenever possible. To assess this you must know the exact definition of OS_object_token_t (is it a struct, an alias to another pointer type, does it already contain const members, etc.). The const in the parameter applies to the referent type, so the real type layout is required.\n\n2) OS_FileSys_Initialize: This function is the caller of OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl. You need the prototype and the call site code to see how the token argument is produced and passed (is a non-const object passed, is there a cast, is the caller expecting modification). A caller that only has a non-const object does not by itself force the callee to remove const, but casts at the call site or reliance on modification would be relevant to determine whether the parameter could/should be const.\n\n3) Any casts or wrapper macros at the call site: Explicit casts (or macros that hide casts) can defeat const qualification or indicate that callers routinely cast away const. Those are necessary to determine whether the const qualifier on the parameter is consistent and safe across usages.\n\n4) int32 typedef: Although not directly about pointer constness, confirming the return type typedef ensures there are no surprising typedefs (e.g. macros expanding to pointer types) that might change the analysis context.\n\n5) OS_SUCCESS: The returned constant's definition confirms the return type correctness and can reveal whether the function is actually an alias/macro that might change the signature; included for completeness to rule out hidden macro substitutions.\n\nThese symbols let the next analyst determine whether the parameter's const qualification is appropriate, whether callers violate or rely on const correctness (casts, modifications), and whether any hidden typedefs/macros affect the interpretation of the function signature."
