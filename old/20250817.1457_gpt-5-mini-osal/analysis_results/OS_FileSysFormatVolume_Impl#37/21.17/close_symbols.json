  "explanation": "OS_SUCCESS \u2014 Confirm this is a simple integer constant (enum or macro) and not a macro or function that expands to or calls any string.h functions (e.g. indirectly invoking memcpy/memset/etc.). If OS_SUCCESS were implemented as something that uses string routines, the target function could violate the rule even though no string calls appear in its body.  \n\nOS_object_token_t \u2014 Verify this typedef/structure does not use any unusual macros, inline functions, or attributes that expand into code that calls string.h routines when referenced in the function signature. Although the token parameter is unused in the body, a pathological macro/type could have side effects at declaration time (or via attributes) that might pull in string operations."
