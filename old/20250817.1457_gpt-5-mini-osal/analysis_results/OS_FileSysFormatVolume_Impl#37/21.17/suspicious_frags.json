  "explanation": "The function OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl contains no calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (no memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). It is a simple no-op that immediately returns OS_SUCCESS and does not reference or manipulate any buffers or pointer parameters (the token parameter is unused). The provided related definitions (OS_SUCCESS macro and the typedef for OS_object_token_t) do not introduce any string handling or buffer accesses. Therefore there are no code fragments in this submission that could cause accesses beyond object bounds via the <string.h> functions and nothing to investigate for Rule 21.17."
