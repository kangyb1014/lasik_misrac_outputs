  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: the function parameter is declared as a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token) and the function body performs no operations on token (it is not dereferenced, assigned to, or cast). The pointer itself is not modified (no token = ...), and there are no casts removing const-qualification. The function is a simple no-op that returns OS_SUCCESS, so there is no code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Other symbols (OS_SUCCESS, int32 typedef) are unrelated to this rule."
