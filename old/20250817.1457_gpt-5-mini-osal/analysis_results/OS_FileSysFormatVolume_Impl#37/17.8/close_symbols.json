  "explanation": "OS_object_token_t: needed to determine the exact typedef/structure of the parameter type. If OS_object_token_t is itself a pointer typedef or has unusual qualifiers, the meaning of the function parameter declaration (const OS_object_token_t *token) changes and that affects whether the pointer itself could be modified or if the declaration already makes the pointer const. OS_SUCCESS: inspect its definition (macro/enum) to ensure the return expression is a plain constant and does not expand to code that could modify the parameter (e.g. a macro with side effects). int32: the typedef/definition of int32 verifies there are no surprising macro expansions or attribute annotations on the return type that might affect parameter semantics."
