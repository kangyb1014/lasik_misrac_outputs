The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this symbol. To be certain the function contains no for-loop behaviour (or for-loops hidden via macros/expressions), the definition of OS_SUCCESS must be inspected to ensure it is an immutable constant and not a macro or expression that could expand to code containing a for loop or side effects that would affect MISRA for-loop analysis.\n\nOS_object_token_t: This is the type of the function parameter. Although the body does not reference the parameter, the type definition could be a macro or typedef that expands to something with side effects or embedded code (unlikely but possible in some code-bases). Inspecting this symbol verifies the parameter declaration does not introduce any hidden for-loops or loop-like behaviour relevant to the MISRA rule.\n\nint32: The return type of the function. Confirming the definition of int32 (typedef or macro) ensures it is a plain integer type and not defined in a way that could introduce code (e.g., function-like macro) that might contain loops or side effects impacting the for-loop well-formedness check.\n\nRationale summary: The target function contains no explicit for statements or function calls. The only remaining places a for loop could be concealed are in macros or type definitions used in the signature or return expression. The three symbols above are sufficient to confirm there are no hidden for-loops or side effects relevant to the MISRA C for-loop well-formedness rule."
