  "explanation": "No occurrence of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided code or related snippets. The only string-comparison and copy calls are strncmp and strncpy: strncmp is used to compare a prefix with an explicit length (not memcmp), and strncpy is used for copying (not comparing). Therefore there are no code fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) in the supplied code. If memcmp is used elsewhere in code not shown here, those locations should be inspected."
