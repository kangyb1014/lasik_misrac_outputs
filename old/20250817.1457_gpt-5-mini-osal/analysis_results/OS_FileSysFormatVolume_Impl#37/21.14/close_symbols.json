  "explanation": "- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically concerns use of memcmp; the analysis must confirm the target function does not call memcmp directly or indirectly (e.g. via a macro or inline wrapper).\n- <string.h> (or the declaration/prototype of memcmp): Ensure that any symbol or macro named memcmp refers to the standard library function (and detect possible macro redefinitions) so the use (or absence) can be correctly identified.\n- OS_object_token_t: The only parameter of the function; inspect its typedef to confirm it is not a char* or a wrapper around a null-terminated string (which could imply hidden string comparisons elsewhere or via macros). If it is a string type, additional scrutiny is needed to see if any implicit comparisons occur.\n- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this identifier; inspect its definition (macro/enum/inline function) to ensure it does not expand to or call memcmp or other string-comparison logic.\n- OS_FileSys_Initialize: The caller shown in the static graph \u2014 check whether the caller or build-time transformations (inlining, macros) could replace or modify the target function body (or cause memcmp to be used in place of the no-op), e.g., via conditional compilation or wrapper macros.\n\nThese symbols suffice to determine whether the target function itself (as compiled in the build) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings or could be transformed into such usage by macros/inlining from its context."
