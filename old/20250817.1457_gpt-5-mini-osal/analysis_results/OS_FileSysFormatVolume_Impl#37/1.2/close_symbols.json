  "explanation": "- OS_SUCCESS: The function returns this symbol. To decide if a language extension is used you must inspect how OS_SUCCESS is defined (macro, enum, or expression). Compiler extensions can appear in macro expansions (e.g. use of __attribute__, asm, extended integer modes, or other compiler-specific constructs).\n- int32: The function return type is int32. This is almost certainly a typedef or macro; its underlying definition must be checked to ensure it does not rely on compiler-specific extensions (e.g. use of non-standard integer modes, attributes, or typedefs that hide compiler extensions).\n- OS_object_token_t: This is the type of the parameter. Even though the parameter is unused in the body, the typedef/struct/union behind this name might use language extensions (packed/aligned attributes, anonymous structs/unions, bit-field extensions, or compiler-specific attributes). Its full definition must be inspected.\n- OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl (declaration/definition): The function declaration/definition itself may include compiler-specific extensions (storage-class or function attributes, calling-convention annotations, macros that expand to __attribute__ or pragmas). Inspecting the actual declaration/definition and any macros used in it is required to verify no language extensions are employed."
