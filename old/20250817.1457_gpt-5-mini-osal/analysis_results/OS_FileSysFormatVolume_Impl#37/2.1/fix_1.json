  "explanation": "Removed the custom forward declarations for FILE, fopen, fprintf, and fclose which conflicted with the standard declarations from <stdio.h>. Instead, included the proper headers (<stdio.h>, <sys/stat.h>, <sys/types.h>) so the standard prototypes are used. To make this snippet self-contained and compilable for testing, I added minimal typedefs for int32 and OS_object_token_t and a const OS_SUCCESS value; these would be omitted in the real project where the project's headers provide them. The function logic is unchanged and remains a no-op that logs to /tmp/logs/297.txt and returns OS_SUCCESS."
