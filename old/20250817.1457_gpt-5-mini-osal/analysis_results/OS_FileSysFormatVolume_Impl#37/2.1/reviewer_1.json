  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.1.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 is A project shall not contain unreachable code.\n.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    /*\n     * In theory, this should wipe any existing files in the ramdisk,\n     * but since ramdisks here are implemented using a directory within a tmpfs,\n     * removal of such files could be risky if something goes wrong,\n     * because it might remove files that were important.\n     *\n     * So the safest option is just a no-op.\n     * (this is also backward compatible since POSIX mkfs was always a no-op)\n     */\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:When OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl returns OS_SUCCESS and the code enters the shown fragment (e.g. during OS_mkfs where should_format is true), OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl is implemented to unconditionally return OS_SUCCESS. Thus return_code is always OS_SUCCESS at the subsequent if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) check, making the else branch (which calls OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl(&token)) unreachable. In this project configuration that else block can never be executed, so the project contains unreachable code.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\ntypedef int int32;\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int reserved;\n} OS_object_token_t;\nstatic const int32 OS_SUCCESS = 0;\n\nint32 OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    /*\n     * In theory, this should wipe any existing files in the ramdisk,\n     * but since ramdisks here are implemented using a directory within a tmpfs,\n     * removal of such files could be risky if something goes wrong,\n     * because it might remove files that were important.\n     *\n     * So the safest option is just a no-op.\n     * (this is also backward compatible since POSIX mkfs was always a no-op)\n     *\n     * Insert probes to log control flow/state for debugging the reported\n     * unreachable-code scenario.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct as presented. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 forbids code that is provably unreachable in the delivered project. Agent A only shows that this single implementation of OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl unconditionally returns OS_SUCCESS, and then speculates that a particular caller\u2019s else branch would therefore never execute. That speculation does not prove an actual project-level unreachable-code violation because:\n\n- Whether the caller\u2019s else branch is unreachable depends on the caller(s) and the whole-program configuration (other implementations, build-time options, platform-specific variants, and possible error paths). A single function returning a constant does not by itself prove that some other branch cannot be executed in the built project. \n- No caller code or full build configuration was provided to show the branch can never be taken. MISRA requires that the code be provably unreachable in the delivered project; that proof is missing.\n- The test probe code meant to gather runtime evidence failed to compile, so there is no runtime confirmation either.\n\nTo demonstrate a genuine Rule 2.1 violation you must show, for the actual project as built, that a particular block of code cannot be executed under any possible program input or configuration (for example by showing all callers can only produce a single outcome, or by whole-program static analysis). Agent A has not provided such evidence, therefore the report is not correct."
