  "explanation": "The only location in the provided code that creates a provable unreachable-path concern is the format-implementation that unconditionally returns success. Because OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl is a no-op returning OS_SUCCESS, the \"format failed\" branch (the else that calls OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl) cannot be exercised for this implementation; this renders the error-handling path effectively unreachable in builds using this implementation and therefore warrants investigation under MISRA Rule 2.1.\n\nAll other code fragments in the provided snippets are guarded by runtime-dependent conditions (parameter checks, return-code checks, object-allocation results, or the should_format input). Those code paths are not provably unreachable from the static view of these fragments (their execution depends on inputs, external functions/macros, or different filesystem implementations) and therefore do not need to be flagged as unreachable based solely on the given source."
