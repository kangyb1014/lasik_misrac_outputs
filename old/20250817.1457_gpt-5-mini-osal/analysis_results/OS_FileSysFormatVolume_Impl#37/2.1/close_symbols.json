  "explanation": "- OS_FileSys_Initialize: Direct caller of OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl (per the static call graph). You must inspect its body to see whether it actually invokes the target function and under what conditions (e.g. conditional/early returns), which determines whether the target function is reachable.\n- OS_mkfs: Caller of OS_FileSys_Initialize. To establish a call chain from program entry points into OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl you must determine whether/when OS_mkfs is invoked at runtime.\n- OS_initfs: Another caller of OS_FileSys_Initialize. Same reason as OS_mkfs \u2014 it may be the actual entry path that causes the initialize routine (and thus the target) to be invoked.\n- OS_SUCCESS: The return value used by the target. Inspecting its definition ensures the return is a simple value and not a macro/attribute that could affect code reachability or compilation (and confirms there is no hidden unreachable code after the return).\n- OS_object_token_t: The target function parameter type. Rare typedefs/attributes (e.g. macros that expand to nothing, compiler attributes) could affect linkage or usage; include it to rule out any special annotations that might render the function unreachable or unused.\n\nThese symbols provide the minimal set needed to determine whether the target function can be reached from program execution (and to rule out hidden/annotation-driven reasons it would be unreachable)."
