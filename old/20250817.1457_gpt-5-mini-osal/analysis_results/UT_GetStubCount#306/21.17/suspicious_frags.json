  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of the string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and ensuring they do not access beyond object bounds. The provided function UT_GetStubCount contains no calls to any <string.h> functions and performs only: a call to UT_GetStubEntry, a NULL check, and a scalar member read (StubPtr->Data.Rc.Count). There is no buffer or string manipulation, no memory copy/set/comparison, and no pointer arithmetic or indexing that could cause out-of-bounds access within this snippet. Therefore there are no fragments in this code that need investigation for Rule 21.17."
