  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The sole function parameter FuncKey is a non-pointer passed by value and is not assigned to or modified anywhere in the function. The function only assigns to local variables (StubPtr and Count). Passing FuncKey to UT_GetStubEntry is by value and does not constitute modification of the parameter within this function. The pointer variable StubPtr is local and may be assigned; Rule 17.8 concerns modifying parameter variables (or reassigning pointer parameters), which does not occur here."
