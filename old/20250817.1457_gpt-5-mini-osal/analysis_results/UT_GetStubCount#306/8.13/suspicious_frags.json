  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointer types should be const-qualified. In this function the only pointer object is StubPtr and its uses (declaration, assignment from UT_GetStubEntry, null check, and dereference). Other fragments do not declare or manipulate pointer types (Count is a scalar, the function parameter is passed by value, the return statement and the else branch are scalar operations), so they are not relevant to assessing const-qualification of pointer types and do not need investigation for Rule 8.13."
