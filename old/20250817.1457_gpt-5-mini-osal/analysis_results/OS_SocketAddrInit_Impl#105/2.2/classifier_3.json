Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketAddrInit_Impl(OS_SockAddr_t *Addr, OS_SocketDomain_t Domain)\n{\n    sa_family_t             sa_family;\n    socklen_t               addrlen;\n    OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor;\n\n    memset(Addr, 0, sizeof(OS_SockAddr_t));\n    Accessor = (OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData;\n\n    switch (Domain)\n    {\n        case OS_SocketDomain_INET:\n            sa_family = AF_INET;\n            addrlen   = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);\n            break;\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n        case OS_SocketDomain_INET6:\n            sa_family = AF_INET6;\n            addrlen   = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6);\n            break;\n#endif\n        default:\n            sa_family = 0;\n            addrlen   = 0;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    if (addrlen == 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED;\n    }\n\n    Addr->ActualLength     = OSAL_SIZE_C(addrlen);\n    Accessor->sa.sa_family = sa_family;\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndefault:\n            sa_family = 0;\n            addrlen   = 0;\n            break;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The default branch is used to handle unsupported/unknown Domain values: it sets addrlen to 0 which causes the subsequent check to return OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Removing these assignments would change behavior for invalid/unsupported Domain inputs, so the operations are not dead code."
