  "explanation": "For a MISRA check focused on detecting language extensions, the next analyzer needs the definitions/macros listed so it can determine whether any of them (or their use here) rely on non\u2011standard language extensions.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: the function writes to and sizeof() this type and accesses its AddrData member. Need its full definition to check for anonymous structs/unions, compiler-specific attributes, flexible/zero-length arrays, or other extensions.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: the code casts &Addr->AddrData to this accessor type and then accesses .sa.sa_family. Its definition must be examined for anonymous members, non\u2011standard alignment/packing attributes, or other extensions that could make the cast or member access rely on a compiler extension.\n- OS_SocketDomain_t: the switch is over this type; its underlying representation (enum or typedef) must be checked for any non\u2011standard annotations or extension usage.\n- OS_SocketDomain_INET and OS_SocketDomain_INET6: the specific enumerator values used in the switch; needed to verify they are standard C enum constants and that their presence/absence (INET6 guarded by a macro) does not rely on extensions.\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: conditional compilation affects control flow. Need to know whether this macro is defined and whether its definition or use involves compiler extensions.\n- OSAL_SIZE_C: a macro used to set Addr->ActualLength. Macros can expand to compiler-specific suffixes or constructs (e.g., GCC integer suffixes or cast expressions); examine its definition to ensure it does not use extensions.\n- OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED and OS_SUCCESS: return constants used by the function. Their definitions should be checked to ensure they are standard integer macros/enum constants and not built from compiler extensions.\n- sa_family_t and socklen_t: these system typedefs are assigned to/used in the function. Their underlying typedefs must be inspected for any implementation-specific typedefs or compiler extensions.\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: system macros used to set sa_family; verify they are plain integer macros from system headers and not produced by extensions.\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6: used indirectly via addrlen = sizeof(...). Their definitions must be checked for anonymous members or implementation extensions (e.g., unnamed bit\u2011fields, nonstandard attributes) that could make sizeof or member accesses non\u2011portable or extension-dependent.\n\nCollecting these symbols allows the analyzer to inspect type and macro definitions to determine if any language/compiler extensions are present or required by the target function's constructs (casts, member access, sizeof, conditional compilation, macro expansion)."
