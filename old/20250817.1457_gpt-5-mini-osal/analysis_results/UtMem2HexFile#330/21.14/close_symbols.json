  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for misuse of memcmp on null-terminated strings:\n\n- fopen: takes the Filename (const char*) passed by UtMem2HexFile. Inspecting fopen (or wrappers) guarantees fopen does not internally call memcmp on the Filename or otherwise compare null-terminated strings using memcmp.\n\n- fprintf: called repeatedly with format strings and arguments (including %s indirectly via printf in error case). A review of fprintf (or any wrapper) is needed to ensure it does not call memcmp to compare null-terminated strings passed from this function.\n\n- fclose: part of the file-handling sequence; include to be thorough when auditing related I/O helpers for illegal memcmp usage.\n\n- printf: used in the error path with Filename and strerror(errno). Need to check whether printf or any platform-specific implementation calls memcmp on its string arguments.\n\n- strerror: returns a char* error string used in printf; must be checked because implementations might internally call memcmp or other string comparisons; also its return is a null-terminated string that could be compared elsewhere.\n\n- errno: the error number passed to strerror; included because it is part of the error reporting chain (helps to trace the path that produces strings passed to string-handling routines).\n\n- isprint: used to decide printable characters from Memory; include to confirm it does not rely on memcmp or perform any string comparisons.\n\n- UtAssert_True: called in the error path; user/project assert implementations frequently manipulate or compare message strings. Its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: appears in the static call graph related to assert handling. Include to inspect the assert/context code path for any memcmp-on-strings usage originating from UtMem2HexFile.\n\n- memcmp: include explicitly so the next analyzer can search the codebase (and library implementations) for uses of memcmp and check each occurrence to determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- uint8, uint32: the typedefs for the integer types used to index and read Memory. Knowing the exact typedefs (signedness/width) clarifies whether Memory is being treated as character data vs raw bytes \u2014 relevant when reasoning about string handling and the potential for being compared as null-terminated strings.\n\n- FILE: the FILE type (and any project wrappers) should be checked to ensure any file/IO helper code does not use memcmp on null-terminated strings passed from this function.\n\nIn short: to prove UtMem2HexFile does or does not violate the MISRA rule you must inspect any called functions (standard library and project assert helpers) that accept or return char* or otherwise handle strings to ensure none of them use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The symbols above identify those callees and the key types/utility (memcmp) to search for."
