  "explanation": "The only code in this function that is potentially unreachable is the final return false; (and, by dependence, the UtAssert_True call that precedes it) because UtAssert_True expands to a test/assert function (UtAssertEx) whose implementation may not return (e.g. it might terminate the program or longjmp). If UtAssertEx is non-returning, the subsequent return false; is unreachable. To determine whether Rule 2.1 is violated, the implementation/attributes of UtAssertEx (and any noreturn annotations) must be inspected. All other statements in the function are reachable for some valid inputs: the fopen() success and failure branches are both possible at runtime; the outer and inner loops execute when Length>0 and the inner else (fprintf(fp, \"   \")) executes when the final line is partial (Length not a multiple of 16); the character-printing if is conditional but reachable for indices < Length. Therefore no other code fragments appear to be statically unreachable."
