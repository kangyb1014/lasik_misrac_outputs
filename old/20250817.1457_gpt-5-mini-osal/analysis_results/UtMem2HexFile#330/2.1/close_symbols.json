  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for reachability (MISRA Rule: no unreachable code):\n\n- fopen: The top-level if tests (fp = fopen(...)). To determine whether the else branch (file-open failure path) can ever be executed, we must know fopen's contract/implementation (can it return NULL, can it abort/never return, or is it stubbed to always succeed?).\n\n- fclose: Although normally does not affect control flow, a nonstandard implementation could alter reachability (e.g., via abort/longjmp). Knowing its behavior rules out unexpected non-returning side effects in the success path.\n\n- fprintf: Used throughout both branches. A custom/std implementation might abort/longjmp on error. To prove code after fprintf is reachable you must know whether fprintf can transfer control (non-returning) in this build.\n\n- printf: Called in the fopen-failure branch. If printf is non-returning in this environment, the subsequent UtAssert_True and return false would be unreachable; conversely, if printf always returns, the code may be reachable. Need its semantics.\n\n- strerror: Called when reporting the fopen error. If strerror can longjmp/abort or has side effects that affect control flow, that matters for reachability of subsequent statements in the else branch.\n\n- errno: The error reporting depends on errno; if errno is a macro or accessor with side effects (or a thread-local that causes non-local control flow in this environment), it can affect reachability of error reporting code. At minimum, errno is needed to understand the error-reporting expression and possible side effects.\n\n- isprint: Used in the printable-character loop. If isprint is implemented as a macro or function with side effects or non-returning behavior, it could affect reachability of the ASCII-print loop. Its semantics are needed to rule out unreachable code inside the inner loops.\n\n- UtAssert_True: Critical for reachability: the function is invoked in the fopen-failure branch. If UtAssert_True is specified or implemented as noreturn (e.g., it aborts, longjmps, calls exit), then the subsequent 'return false;' is unreachable. Conversely, if it returns normally, the return false is reachable. Need UtAssert_True implementation/attributes.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: The static call graph indicates UtAssert_True may call UtAssert_GetContext; that helper or related assert infrastructure may determine whether assertions are fatal (non-returning) or recoverable. Including UtAssert_GetContext (and related assert internals) is necessary to determine whether assertion paths terminate or return.\n\n- FILE: Type definition (and any instrumentation around it) can affect how fopen/fclose are implemented in this environment (e.g., custom FILE that triggers non-local control flow). Include the type to inspect any nonstandard behaviors or wrappers.\n\n- uint8, uint32: Type definitions are required to ensure the loops and index arithmetic are well-formed and do not invoke undefined behavior that could be optimized away as unreachable. For example, if Length is a type that makes the for-loops never iterate, some blocks could be statically unreachable; knowing the exact unsigned types and their ranges is necessary to reason about loop reachability.\n\nSummary: The primary unreachable-code question here centers on (1) whether the fopen failure branch can occur and (2) whether UtAssert_True (or other called functions) are non-returning. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to determine those behaviors in the given build/context."
