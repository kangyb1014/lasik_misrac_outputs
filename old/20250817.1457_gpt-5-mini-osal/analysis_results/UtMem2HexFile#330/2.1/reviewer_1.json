If UtAssertEx (the underlying call) does not return (for example it aborts, longjmps, or otherwise terminates the calling function), then the subsequent statement 'return false;' is unreachable. That unreachable return (and any code after the non-returning assertion) would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. (If, however, UtAssertEx is guaranteed to return normally, there is no unreachable code in this fragment.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void UtProbe_Log(const char *stage, const void *Memory, const char *Filename, unsigned long Length, unsigned long i, unsigned long j)\n{\n    FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2641.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"stage=%s Filename=%s Length=%lu i=%lu j=%lu Memory=%p\\n\",\n                stage, (Filename != NULL) ?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s scenario is logically correct in principle: if UtAssert_True is a non\u2011returning routine (e.g. it aborts, longjmps or is declared _Noreturn), then the statement that follows it (the return false;) is indeed unreachable at run time, and that unreachable statement would be a breach of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. However, the report as stated does not provide the necessary evidence that UtAssert_True is non\u2011returning. Without inspecting the definition or prototype of UtAssert_True (e.g. whether it is declared with _Noreturn or an equivalent compiler attribute, or whether its implementation always terminates the program), one cannot conclude that the code in the project actually contains unreachable code. The probe code pasted by Agent A did not produce confirming logs, so it is inconclusive. Therefore the claim that the given UtMem2HexFile function violates Rule 2.1 is not justified based on the information provided. To settle this deterministically, examine the UtAssert_True/UtAssertEx declaration and implementation; if it is non\u2011returning, remove or guard the subsequent return (or restructure) so no unreachable code remains."
