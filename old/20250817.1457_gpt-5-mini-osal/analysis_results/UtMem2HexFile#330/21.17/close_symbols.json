  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to decide if UtMem2HexFile violates the <string.h> access-bounds MISRA rule:\n\n- strerror: Declared in <string.h>. This is the only direct reference to a <string.h> routine in the function (used in the error printf). You must inspect its usage to see whether it (or its return) could cause or propagate any out-of-bounds accesses relevant to the rule.\n\n- errno: Passed to strerror; include to confirm the standard errno semantics and that strerror(errno) call is the standard one.\n\n- printf: Used to report the fopen failure with a \"%s\" format that passes Filename. Although printf is in <stdio.h> (not <string.h>), it performs string reads of the supplied char * (Filename). Include it to check whether any string-handling calls outside <string.h> could read beyond bounds and to ensure the analyzer distinguishes printf usage from <string.h> violations.\n\n- fprintf: Widely used in the function (formats address, hex bytes, ASCII). It consumes data from Filename only in the error path? Still include to inspect whether any formatted output could cause reads of memory beyond the provided buffers (even though not a <string.h> function).\n\n- fopen / fclose: fopen is called with Filename. Include to verify the requirement that Filename be a NUL-terminated string (and whether any path could pass a non-terminated buffer that would cause subsequent string ops). fclose for completeness of stdio usage.\n\n- isprint: Used when printing ASCII characters; include to ensure it does not internally invoke any <string.h> functionality or perform unexpected reads (usually it does not, but include for completeness).\n\n- UtAssert_True: Called in the error path (assert helper). Need to inspect its implementation to ensure it does not call any <string.h> functions with pointers originating from this function (e.g., Filename or Memory) that could produce out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Shown in the static call graph as a callee related to the UtAssert family; include to inspect its implementation for any indirect <string.h> calls.\n\n- FILE: Type of fp; include so the analyzer can reason about stdio buffer behaviors if relevant to string operations.\n\n- uint8, uint32, bool: Types used for pointer arithmetic and indexing into Memory. These are required to reason about whether the explicit memory accesses ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j] can go out of bounds (even though this is not a <string.h> function, it is relevant context when deciding whether any string.h usage in the function could reference the same buffers).\n\nNote: The MISRA rule quoted applies strictly to functions from <string.h>. The only direct <string.h> symbol in this function is strerror; however, to be conservative and allow the next analyzer to fully determine compliance, the listed stdio, ctype, assertion helpers, errno and type symbols are included so the analyzer can (1) confirm there are no other indirect calls into <string.h>, (2) check whether any string-reading operations (e.g., printf/fprintf) are passed user buffers that could be unterminated, and (3) reason about explicit buffer indexing in Memory."
