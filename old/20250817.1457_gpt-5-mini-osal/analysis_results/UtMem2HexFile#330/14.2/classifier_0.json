  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMem2HexFile:\n```c\nbool UtMem2HexFile(const void *Memory, const char *Filename, uint32 Length)\n{\n    FILE * fp;\n    uint32 i;\n    uint32 j;\n\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"w\")))\n    {\n        for (i = 0; i < Length; i += 16)\n        {\n            fprintf(fp, \"   %06lX: \", (unsigned long)i);\n            for (j = 0; j < 16; j++)\n            {\n                if ((i + j) < Length)\n                    fprintf(fp, \"%02X \", ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]);\n                else\n                    fprintf(fp, \"   \");\n            }\n            fprintf(fp, \" \");\n            for (j = 0; j < 16; j++)\n            {\n                if ((i + j) < Length)\n                    fprintf(fp, \"%c\", isprint(((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The variables 'i' and 'j' are declared as uint32 before the loops, but each for statement initializes the respective counter in its first clause (for (i = 0; ...) and for (j = 0; ...)). Each for loop uses a single loop counter, the loop-controlling expressions only reference the loop counter and objects not modified in the loop body (e.g. Length), and the third clauses modify only the loop counters (i += 16, j++). The loop counters are not modified in the loop bodies. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated."
