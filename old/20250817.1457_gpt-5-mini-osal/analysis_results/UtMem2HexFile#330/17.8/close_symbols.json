  "explanation": "You need the following symbols to determine whether UtMem2HexFile modifies any of its parameters (Memory, Filename, Length). For each symbol below I explain why it is required for checking the MISRA rule (a function parameter shall not be modified):\n\n- UtAssert_True\n  - UtMem2HexFile calls UtAssert_True in the error path. UtAssert_True may be a macro that expands into code which could (in theory) perform assignments or take addresses of local variables. Inspecting its definition ensures it does not implicitly assign to or take the address of the function parameters.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext\n  - The static call graph shows UtAssert_GetContext as a callee (likely used by UtAssert_True). You need its definition to ensure no macro/inline/auxiliary code reachable from UtAssert_True modifies the parameter variables.\n\n- fopen\n  - fopen is called with Filename. While standard fopen takes a copy of the pointer, some environments could provide wrapper macros. Confirming its prototype/implementation ensures it does not modify the caller's Filename parameter.\n\n- fprintf\n  - fprintf is used repeatedly with fp and values derived from Memory/Length. Confirming fprintf is a function (not a macro with side effects on local variables) ensures no implicit modification of the parameters.\n\n- fclose\n  - fclose is called with fp; confirm it is the standard function and does not modify any of the function parameters.\n\n- printf\n  - printf is used in the error message. As with the other stdio functions, check it is not a macro that could write to or reassign local parameter variables.\n\n- strerror\n  - strerror(errno) is used to format the error message. Ensure its implementation/macro form does not modify any of the function parameters.\n\n- errno\n  - errno is referenced when calling strerror. Knowing whether errno is a macro or an lvalue object in your environment is necessary to ensure no surprising side-effect modifies function parameters.\n\n- isprint\n  - isprint is used on bytes read from Memory. In some implementations isprint may be a macro; inspect it to ensure it does not expand into code that could modify parameters.\n\n- uint8\n  - The code casts Memory to (uint8 *). You must know the typedef of uint8 to confirm it is an integral type (e.g., unsigned char) and not some pointer/container type. If uint8 were a pointer typedef, operations like ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j] could imply different semantics; verifying the typedef ensures the cast/dereference does not involve reassigning the Memory parameter itself.\n\n- uint32\n  - Ensure uint32 is an integer typedef (not a struct or pointer) so that usage of Length as a loop counter cannot hide any macro or operator overloading that would reassign the Length parameter.\n\n- FILE\n  - Confirm the FILE type used for fp is the standard FILE object (or a known typedef) so that uses of fp with stdio functions are not macros that could modify the function parameters.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/prototypes of the listed functions, macros and typedefs to verify they are standard functions/typedefs (or harmless inline/macros) and that none of their expansions or implementations perform assignments to the local parameter variables Memory, Filename or Length. This is sufficient to conclude whether the function itself (including any macro expansions of callees) modifies its parameters."
