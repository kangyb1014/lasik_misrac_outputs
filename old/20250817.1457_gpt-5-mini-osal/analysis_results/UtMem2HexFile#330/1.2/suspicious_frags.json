  "explanation": "No other code constructs in the provided snippets appear to rely on compiler-specific language extensions. The function body uses standard C library calls (fopen, fprintf, fclose, printf, strerror), standard preprocessing macros (__FILE__, __LINE__), standard casts, and standard character-class functions (isprint). The use of bool, fixed-width typedefs (uint8_t/uint32_t aliases), and format specifiers with appropriate casts are standard C features rather than compiler extensions. There are no inline assembly blocks, GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin__ usages, no statement-expressions, no typeof, no named sections, no pragma directives, and no other nonstandard tokens present. Therefore those parts do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
