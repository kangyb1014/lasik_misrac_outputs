  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMem2HexFile:\n```c\nbool UtMem2HexFile(const void *Memory, const char *Filename, uint32 Length)\n{\n    FILE * fp;\n    uint32 i;\n    uint32 j;\n\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"w\")))\n    {\n        for (i = 0; i < Length; i += 16)\n        {\n            fprintf(fp, \"   %06lX: \", (unsigned long)i);\n            for (j = 0; j < 16; j++)\n            {\n                if ((i + j) < Length)\n                    fprintf(fp, \"%02X \", ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]);\n                else\n                    fprintf(fp, \"   \");\n            }\n            fprintf(fp, \" \");\n            for (j = 0; j < 16; j++)\n            {\n                if ((i + j) < Length)\n                    fprintf(fp, \"%c\", isprint(((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]) ?

  "scenario": "The function UtAssert_GetContext() returns DefaultContext and is referenced by the UtAssert_True macro (which expands to call UtAssert_GetContext()). Because the function is invoked by the assertion infrastructure, it is executed and its removal would change program behaviour (or break linkage). Therefore this fragment is not dead code and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
