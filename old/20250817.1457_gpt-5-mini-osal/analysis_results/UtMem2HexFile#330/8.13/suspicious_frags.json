  "explanation": "The only places that potentially violate Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible) are the explicit casts that remove the const-qualification from the Memory parameter: each occurrence of ((uint8 *)Memory)[i + j]. Other pointer uses in this function do not need investigation for this rule: the function parameters are declared const where appropriate (const void *Memory, const char *Filename); FILE *fp is required by the C stdio API; the cast to (unsigned long) for i is not a pointer-related issue; calls to library functions (fopen, fprintf, printf, strerror, isprint) follow their documented signatures. Therefore only the shown cast-away-const usages should be investigated."
