  "explanation": "The remaining code statements do not present pointer-to-non-const issues that would fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: local scalar and array declarations (Ct, SegmentValid, Local_SegmentCounters, Local_SegmentName) are object definitions not pointer declarations; the UT_BSP_Lock()/UT_BSP_Unlock() calls contain no pointer arguments here and thus cannot reflect a missing const qualification in this fragment; the ++ and assignment operations on the counter objects operate on non-pointer objects and are appropriate; the memset call is correctly passing a modifiable destination (must be non-const) so it is not a candidate for const qualification. The listed fragments are the places where addresses or string data are passed to functions and therefore warrant investigation to ensure parameters (or local pointer declarations used) are const-qualified where possible."
