  "explanation": "Only the above fragments either use functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, memset) or define a buffer whose size is derived from sizeof(CurrentSegment) and therefore could lead to out-of-bounds accesses when used with those functions. All other lines in the function are control flow, lock/unlock calls, arithmetic updates, loop iterations, or function calls that do not invoke <string.h> string/ memory functions and thus are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The comment asserting safety for strcpy does not eliminate the need to inspect the strcpy usage and the related buffer declaration and sizes \u2014 those are included above for investigation."
