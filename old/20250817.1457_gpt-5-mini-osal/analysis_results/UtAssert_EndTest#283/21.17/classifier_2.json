  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. memset is invoked with the address of the object (&UT_SegmentCounters) and the size is sizeof(UT_SegmentCounters), so exactly the storage of that object is written and there is no out-of-bounds access. (Note: if UT_SegmentCounters were a pointer to externally sized memory and sizeof were applied to the pointer, that could be unsafe \u2014 not the case here.)"
