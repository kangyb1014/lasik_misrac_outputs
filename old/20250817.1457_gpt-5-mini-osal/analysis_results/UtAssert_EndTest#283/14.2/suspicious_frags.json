  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No suspicious for-loop fragments found. The only for statement is: for (Ct = 0; Ct < UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX; ++Ct) { UT_TotalCounters.CaseCount[Ct] += UT_SegmentCounters.CaseCount[Ct]; }\n- Clause 1: the first clause sets only the loop counter (Ct = 0).\n- Clause 2: the condition uses only the loop counter and a compile-time constant (UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX); it has no persistent side-effects and does not reference any object modified in the loop body.\n- Clause 3: the iteration expression increments only the loop counter (++Ct) and does not modify other objects.\n- Clause 4: there is a single loop counter (Ct) and it is not modified in the loop body; the body performs only indexed updates to CaseCount arrays and contains no function calls that could have side effects on the loop control.\nNo other for loops are present in the function. Therefore, under MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 this code fragment does not require further investigation."
