  "explanation": "All other code in the function only reads or dereferences the parameter and operates on local variables or the object referred to; these actions do not modify the pointer parameter itself and therefore do not violate Rule 17.8. For example: the socket() call, the switch statements, assignments to os_proto/os_type/os_domain/os_flags/impl->fd, and the setsockopt() call only use token-derived values or local variables. The only places that could potentially modify the parameter variable are the three fragments listed above because they involve macros/functions that take token (or *token) as an argument; their expansions or implementations must be inspected to ensure they do not perform an assignment to the parameter itself. Reading or dereferencing *token is permitted by the rule (the object pointed to may be modified, but not the pointer variable), so other occurrences are not suspicious."
