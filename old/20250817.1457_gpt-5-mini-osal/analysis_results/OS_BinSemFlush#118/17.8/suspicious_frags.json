  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found in the provided function: the only parameter is `osal_id_t sem_id`, which is an integer type passed by value and is not assigned to or otherwise modified anywhere in OS_BinSemFlush. The other variables, `token` and `return_code`, are local to the function. Calls made (OS_ObjectIdGetById and OS_BinSemFlush_Impl) receive `sem_id` by value and `&token` (a pointer to a local object) \u2014 modifying the object pointed to is allowed by the rule, and the current function does not modify any pointer-typed parameter (it has none). Therefore there are no places in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing here needs further investigation for that rule."
