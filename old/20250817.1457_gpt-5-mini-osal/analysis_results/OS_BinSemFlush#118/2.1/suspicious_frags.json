  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided snippets. Rationale:\n\n- OS_BinSemFlush: The only conditional is if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) which is dependent on the runtime result of OS_ObjectIdGetById; the call to OS_BinSemFlush_Impl is therefore potentially reachable. The final return return_code is reachable on all paths.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: Early return after OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit failure is an intended, reachable error path. The subsequent code (OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex, token->obj_id assignment, OS_ObjectIdConvertToken) is only executed when the previous step succeeds; the error-path call to OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(token) is reachable when return_code != OS_SUCCESS. No statements occur after an unconditional return that would make them dead.\n\n- OS_BinSemFlush_Impl: The early return on mutex-acquire failure (return OS_SEM_FAILURE) is a reachable runtime path; the remainder of the function (increment flush_request, pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_mutex_unlock, return OS_SUCCESS) is executed when the mutex is acquired. There are no statements after an unconditional return in a block that would be unreachable.\n\n- No constant-condition constructs, unreachable labels, #if 0 blocks, or other constructs that would produce statically unreachable code are present in the shown code. Macros used (e.g., OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) are used in expressions and do not imply unreachable code in the provided context.\n\nTherefore, based on the supplied code, there are no fragments that obviously violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code). If additional files/macros or preprocessor conditionals exist outside the provided snippets, those should be reviewed separately."
