    "return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sem_id, &token);",
    "return_code = OS_BinSemFlush_Impl(&token);"
  ],
  "explanation": "Only the two call sites that pass the address of 'token' are potential MISRA Rule 8.13 concerns because they take a pointer to a local object. There are no other pointer expressions or pointer-typed variables in this function (the parameter 'sem_id' is not a pointer, the local declarations are plain objects, and the return statement is not pointer-related). Therefore other fragments (function signature, local variable declarations, macros used as arguments, and the final 'return return_code;') do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 in this function."
