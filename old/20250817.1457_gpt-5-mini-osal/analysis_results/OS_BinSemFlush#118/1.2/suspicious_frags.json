  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code. I inspected the fragments for common documented compiler extensions (tokens and constructs such as __attribute__, __asm / asm, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), labels-as-values, nested functions, GCC/Clang-specific __attribute__((...)) uses, or other vendor-specific keywords) and found none.\n\nReasons the shown fragments do NOT need investigation for Rule 1.2:\n- Function definitions and calls (OS_BinSemFlush, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_BinSemFlush_Impl) use standard C syntax and standard typedef aliases (int32/int32_t, osal_id_t). These are not compiler extensions.\n- Use of POSIX threading APIs (pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_mutex_unlock) are library/API calls, not language extensions.\n- The pre/post-increment (++sem->flush_request), pointer dereferences, and macro-like invocations (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...)) are ordinary C usage; no extension tokens are present in the shown expansions.\n\nNote/limitation: Some macros or functions referenced but not defined here (for example OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_bin_sem_table, OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex) could internally use compiler extensions. Those implementations are outside the provided code; they would need to be inspected directly to determine whether they use documented compiler extensions. Based on only the provided source lines, there are no explicit language-extension usages to report."
