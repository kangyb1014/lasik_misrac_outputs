  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In OS_TaskCreate_Impl the variable task is only used for reads (task->priority and task->stack_size). MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever it is only used for observation. Declaring task as const OS_task_internal_record_t *task would satisfy the rule (assigning the non-const pointer returned by OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET to a pointer-to-const is allowed). The impl variable cannot be made const here because its member address (&impl->id) is taken and passed on, so it must remain non-const. The empty test log does not affect the static correctness of the rule application. Thus the reported violation is valid and fixable by making task a pointer-to-const."
