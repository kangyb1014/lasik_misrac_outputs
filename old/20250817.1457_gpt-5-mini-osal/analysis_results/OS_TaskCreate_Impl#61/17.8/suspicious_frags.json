  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies either of the function parameters. Details: \n- The pointer parameter token is only read and dereferenced (*token) when used as an index/argument; there is no assignment to token, no increment/decrement, and no re\u2011binding of the pointer variable. Reading the object referred to by the pointer is permitted by the rule. \n- The scalar parameter flags is unused and is not assigned to or otherwise modified. \n- The assignment arg.id = OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token) calls a function with token as an argument but does not modify the token variable in this function; even if the callee modifies the object pointed to, that is allowed by the rule (the pointer itself must not be modified). \n- The calls to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) and OS_Posix_InternalTaskCreate_Impl(...) use *token or impl->id but do not change the value of the parameter variables. \nGiven the above, there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
