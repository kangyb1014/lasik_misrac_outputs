  "explanation": "The only use of a <string.h> function in this function is the single memset call above; no other string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code. The memset invocation should be investigated to ensure the size argument matches the actual object and does not cause an out\u2011of\u2011bounds write. All other lines in the function do not call string.h functions and therefore do not fall under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17; the union access pattern (setting arg.id then later using arg.opaque_arg) is a semantic/aliasing concern but not a string.h bounds issue and so is not flagged here."
