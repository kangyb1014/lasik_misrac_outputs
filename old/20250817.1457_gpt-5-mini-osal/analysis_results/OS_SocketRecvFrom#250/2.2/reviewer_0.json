Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_SocketRecvFrom.\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketRecvFrom(osal_id_t sock_id, void *buffer, size_t buflen, OS_SockAddr_t *RemoteAddr, int32 timeout)\n{\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    OS_object_token_t            token;\n    int32                        return_code;\n\n    /*\n     * Check parameters\n     *\n     * Note \"RemoteAddr\" is not checked, because in certain configurations it can be validly null.\n     */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(buffer);\n    OS_CHECK_SIZE(buflen);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_REFCOUNT, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sock_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, token);\n\n        if (stream->socket_type != OS_SocketType_DATAGRAM)\n        {\n            return_code = OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_TYPE;\n        }\n        else if ((stream->stream_state & OS_STREAM_STATE_BOUND) == 0)\n        {\n            /* Socket needs to be bound first */\n            return_code = OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return_code = OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl(&token, buffer, buflen, RemoteAddr, timeout);\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:When RemoteAddr == NULL the code sets sa = NULL and executes addrlen = 0. Later recvfrom is called with sa (NULL) and &addrlen, and RemoteAddr->ActualLength is only written when RemoteAddr != NULL. POSIX says that if src_addr is NULL the addrlen argument is ignored, so the value stored in addrlen is never used in this branch. Therefore the assignment addrlen = 0 is executed but could be removed without affecting program behaviour \u2014 it is dead code.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void ensure_log_dir(void)\n{\n    /* Attempt to create the directory; if it already exists, ignore the error. */\n    if (mkdir(\"/tmp/logs\", 0755) != 0)\n    {\n        if (errno != EEXIST)\n        {\n            /* If mkdir fails for another reason, still continue; logging may fail later. */\n        }\n    }\n}\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f;\n    va_list ap;\n\n    ensure_log_dir();\n\n    f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2002.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_SocketRecvFrom(osal_id_t sock_id, void *buffer, size_t buflen, OS_SockAddr_t *RemoteAddr, int32 timeout)\n{\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    OS_object_token_t            token;\n    int32                        return_code;\n\n    /* Log entry and incoming parameters (do not dereference RemoteAddr).\n     * cast values to types suitable for printing; keep logging non-intrusive. */\n    probe_log(\"ENTRY: OS_SocketRecvFrom(sock_id=%llu, buffer=%p, buflen=%zu, RemoteAddr=%p, timeout=%d)\",\n              (unsigned long long)sock_id, buffer, buflen, (void *)RemoteAddr, (int)timeout);\n\n    /*\n     * Check parameters\n     *\n     * Note \"RemoteAddr\" is not checked, because in certain configurations it can be validly null.\n     */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(buffer);\n    OS_CHECK_SIZE(buflen);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_REFCOUNT, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sock_id, &token);\n    probe_log(\"OS_ObjectIdGetById returned %d for sock_id=%llu\", return_code, (unsigned long long)sock_id);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, token);\n\n        probe_log(\"Resolved token=%p, stream=%p, socket_type=%d, stream_state=0x%08x\",\n                  (void *)&token, (void *)stream,\n                  (int)(stream ? stream->socket_type : -1), (unsigned int)(stream ? stream->stream_state : 0));\n\n        if (stream->socket_type != OS_SocketType_DATAGRAM)\n        {\n            probe_log(\"Socket type incorrect: expected DATAGRAM, got %d\", (int)stream->socket_type);\n            return_code = OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_TYPE;\n        }\n        else if ((stream->stream_state & OS_STREAM_STATE_BOUND) == 0)\n        {\n            /* Socket needs to be bound first */\n            probe_log(\"Socket state incorrect: not bound (stream_state=0x%08x)\", (unsigned int)stream->stream_state);\n            return_code = OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /* Log the fact that we are about to call the implementation.\n             * Crucially capture whether RemoteAddr is NULL to reproduce the\n             * reported dead-assignment scenario (the assignment inside the\n             * implementation when RemoteAddr == NULL). */\n            probe_log(\"Calling OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl with RemoteAddr=%p (NULL? %s)\",\n                      (void *)RemoteAddr, (RemoteAddr == NULL) ? \"YES\" : \"NO\");\n\n            return_code = OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl(&token, buffer, buflen, RemoteAddr, timeout);\n\n            probe_log(\"OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl returned %d\", return_code);\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n        probe_log(\"Released token=%p\", (void *)&token);\n    }\n\n    probe_log(\"EXIT: OS_SocketRecvFrom returning %d for sock_id=%llu\", return_code, (unsigned long long)sock_id);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_SocketRecvFrom.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The code shown (OS_SocketRecvFrom) contains no obviously dead assignment \u2014 it only forwards the RemoteAddr pointer to OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl. The alleged dead assignment (addrlen = 0 when RemoteAddr == NULL) is described as occurring inside OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl, which is not part of the submitted function. A valid MISRA\u20112.2 finding requires proof that removing the operation would not affect program behaviour across the whole project/target platform. Even if POSIX specifies that recvfrom ignores addrlen when src_addr is NULL, that only applies on POSIX targets and only to that call; the assignment could be (a) defensive initialization, (b) needed on non\u2011POSIX platforms, or (c) relied on elsewhere in the implementation (or for diagnostics/error paths). Note also MISRA\u2019s note that initialization semantics differ from ordinary assignment. Because the purported dead assignment is outside the shown function and no project\u2011wide analysis is presented to prove its removal is behaviour\u2011preserving, the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation against OS_SocketRecvFrom is not supported."
