  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_Application_Startup code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_Application_Startup.\n```c\nvoid OS_Application_Startup(void)\n{\n    int32 Status;\n\n    Status = OS_API_Init();\n    if (Status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"Error: OS_API_Init() failed with status=%d\\n\", (int)Status);\n        OS_ApplicationExit(Status);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:In the switch(idtype) inside OS_API_Init the default label contains an empty block with only a break (\"default: { break; }\"). This statement, when executed, performs no action and removing it would not change program behavior (control simply continues after the switch). Therefore it is executed but redundant and constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/58.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging is not available, do not change program behaviour */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Timestamp and pid for correlating logs */\n    time_t now = time(NULL);\n    struct tm tm_buf;\n    if (localtime_r(&now, &tm_buf) != NULL)\n    {\n        char ts[64];\n        if (strftime(ts, sizeof(ts), \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", &tm_buf) > 0)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"[%s] pid=%d \", ts, (int)getpid());\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"[time-error] pid=%d \", (int)getpid());\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"[no-time] pid=%d \", (int)getpid());\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nvoid OS_Application_Startup(void)\n{\n    int32 Status;\n\n    probe_log(\"OS_Application_Startup: enter\");\n\n    probe_log(\"OS_Application_Startup: calling OS_API_Init()\");\n    Status = OS_API_Init();\n    probe_log(\"OS_API_Init returned Status=%d\", (int)Status);\n\n    if (Status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Log failure path and preserve original behaviour */\n        probe_log(\"OS_Application_Startup: OS_API_Init failed with status=%d\", (int)Status);\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"Error: OS_API_Init() failed with status=%d\\n\", (int)Status);\n        probe_log(\"OS_Application_Startup: calling OS_ApplicationExit with status=%d\", (int)Status);\n        OS_ApplicationExit(Status);\n    }\n\n    probe_log(\"OS_Application_Startup: completed successfully with Status=%d\", (int)Status);\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_Application_Startup.

  "explanation": "The report is not supported. MISRA 2.2 forbids code that is executed yet removable without changing program behaviour. Agent A only points to a \"default: { break; }\" inside OS_API_Init and asserts that it is executed and redundant. There are two missing proofs required to call this a 2.2 violation: (1) evidence that the default label is actually executed at run time, and (2) evidence that removing the default: break; cannot change behaviour in any possible program state. Neither is provided. In particular: - The supplied test instrumentation did not show any runtime traces for OS_Application_Startup/OS_API_Init, so there is no proof the default path is taken. - A default with a break is not inherently dead: its presence can be semantically significant depending on the switch layout (for example it may prevent fall-through into subsequent case labels if it appears before them). Removing the default label could therefore change behaviour unless you can show the label is last and no fall-through effects exist. - MISRA 2.2 requires the operation to be executed and redundant; without the full OS_API_Init switch context or runtime evidence you cannot conclude that. Therefore the claim that OS_Application_Startup (or the project) violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct as presented. To turn this into a valid report you must provide the full switch context and demonstrate that the default branch is both reachable in some execution and provably removable without changing behaviour (or show static analysis proving it is executed but redundant)."
