  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_Application_Startup code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_Application_Startup.\n```c\nvoid OS_Application_Startup(void)\n{\n    int32 Status;\n\n    Status = OS_API_Init();\n    if (Status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"Error: OS_API_Init() failed with status=%d\\n\", (int)Status);\n        OS_ApplicationExit(Status);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The switch contains a 'default: break;' label that performs no action. If control reaches the default, the break merely exits the switch; removing the default (or its break) would not change program behaviour. Therefore this executed no-op is redundant and constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nvoid OS_Application_Startup(void)\n{\n    int32 Status;\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/58.txt\", \"a\");\n\n    /* Probe: record entry to function */\n    if (fp != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(fp, \"OS_Application_Startup: entry\\n\");\n        fflush(fp);\n    }\n\n    Status = OS_API_Init();\n\n    /* Probe: record return status from OS_API_Init */\n    if (fp != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(fp, \"OS_API_Init returned status=%ld\\n\", (long)Status);\n        fflush(fp);\n    }\n\n    if (Status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Record the error path for later analysis */\n        if (fp != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(fp, \"OS_Application_Startup: detected failure (status=%ld). About to call BSP_DEBUG and OS_ApplicationExit.\\n\", (long)Status);\n            fflush(fp);\n        }\n\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"Error: OS_API_Init() failed with status=%d\\n\", (int)Status);\n\n        if (fp != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(fp, \"OS_Application_Startup: BSP_DEBUG called\\n\");\n            fflush(fp);\n        }\n\n        OS_ApplicationExit(Status);\n\n        /* If OS_ApplicationExit returns, log that fact */\n        if (fp != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(fp, \"OS_Application_Startup: OS_ApplicationExit returned (unexpected)\\n\");\n            fflush(fp);\n            fclose(fp);\n        }\n\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Probe: normal successful exit */\n    if (fp != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(fp, \"OS_Application_Startup: completed successfully\\n\");\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_Application_Startup.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The alleged violation (a redundant \"default: break;\" in a switch) does not appear in the supplied OS_Application_Startup code \u2014 there is no switch at all \u2014 so the scenario is mismatched to the target. In the provided function every executed operation has a behavioural effect: OS_API_Init() is called and its result is tested; on failure BSP_DEBUG is invoked and OS_ApplicationExit is called. Removing any of those executed statements would change program behaviour. Note also that if OS_ApplicationExit never returns then code after it would be unreachable; per the rule notes unreachable code is distinct from dead code and is not a Rule 2.2 violation. The additional test harness with file I/O and the empty log do not demonstrate a redundant executed no-op in the original function. Therefore the agent A report is incorrect."
