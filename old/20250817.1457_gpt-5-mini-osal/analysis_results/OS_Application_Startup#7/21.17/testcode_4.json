  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call to strcmp(TypeName, StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr) is performed without any prior validation that either pointer is non-NULL and points to a NUL-terminated buffer. If StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr was never initialized (NULL) or contains a non-NUL-terminated string, or if the caller passed a NULL or non-terminated TypeName, strcmp will read beyond the bounds (or dereference NULL). For example, if Position equals ReturnSize so the left side of the || is false, strcmp is evaluated and can access out-of-bounds memory when ContentTypeStr==NULL or not NUL-terminated. This can result in undefined behavior and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_Application_Startup code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/63.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_Application_Startup as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Application_Startup:\n```c\nvoid OS_Application_Startup(void)\n{\n    int32 Status;\n\n    Status = OS_API_Init();\n    if (Status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"Error: OS_API_Init() failed with status=%d\\n\", (int)Status);\n        OS_ApplicationExit(Status);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_Application_Startup code.\n",
