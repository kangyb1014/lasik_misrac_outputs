  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided fragment. The code uses standard C constructs only: a function definition with a void parameter list, a local variable named int32 (which is a type alias/typedef in many codebases but is not itself a language extension), a normal function call and comparison, a standard C cast (int)Status, and a macro/function BSP_DEBUG (macros and function calls are standard C). There are no identifiers or tokens that indicate known compiler extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm, __extension__, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) GCC extension, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 based on the provided code."
