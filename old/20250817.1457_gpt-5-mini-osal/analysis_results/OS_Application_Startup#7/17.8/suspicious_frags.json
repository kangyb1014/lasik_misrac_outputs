  "explanation": "The function OS_Application_Startup has the signature void OS_Application_Startup(void) and therefore has no parameters to modify. The only variable modified is the local variable 'Status' (assigned from OS_API_Init()). All function calls pass arguments by value: BSP_DEBUG receives a format string and the value (int)Status, and OS_ApplicationExit is called with the value Status. There are no pointer parameters in this function whose pointers or pointed-to objects are being modified here. Consequently, there are no code fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
