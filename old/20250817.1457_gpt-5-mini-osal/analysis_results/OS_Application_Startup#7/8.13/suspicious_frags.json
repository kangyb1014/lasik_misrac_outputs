  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and parameters (pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible). In this snippet there are no pointer declarations or uses except for the single reported call. Specifically: - The local declaration is a scalar: \"int32 Status;\" \u2014 not a pointer. - The cast \"(int)Status\" is a scalar conversion, not pointer-related. - The function signature \"void OS_Application_Startup(void)\" has no pointer parameters. - The calls to OS_API_Init() and OS_ApplicationExit(Status) in this snippet pass/return scalar values (no pointer syntax such as & or * is used here). Because no other pointer usage appears in the provided code, no other fragments need investigation under Rule 8.13."
