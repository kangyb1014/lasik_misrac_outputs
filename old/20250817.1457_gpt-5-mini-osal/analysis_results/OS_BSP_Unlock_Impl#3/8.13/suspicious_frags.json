  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not present potential MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 issues: the local variable declaration \"int status;\" is not a pointer and thus not relevant; the if/else flow and the numeric check on status are control logic only; the call pthread_setcancelstate(OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState, NULL) passes a plain int as the first argument and NULL for the second (no non-const pointer object is being declared or passed that could/should be const-qualified here); the BSP_DEBUG format string itself is not a pointer declaration. Therefore only the listed fragments (address-of the mutex, the use of strerror, and the global object declaration which may define pointer-bearing members) need investigation for potential missing const qualifications."
