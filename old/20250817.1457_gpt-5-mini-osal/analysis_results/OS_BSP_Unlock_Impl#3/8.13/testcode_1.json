  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call strerror(status) returns a char * (non-const pointer to a static, read\u2011only error string). Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types when possible. Because the returned pointer is not const-qualified and is used directly, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Recommended fix: capture the return in a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const char *msg = strerror(status); BSP_DEBUG(\"%s\\n\", msg);) or use a const-correct API if available.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/27.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Restore previous cancellability state */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState, NULL);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl code.\n",
