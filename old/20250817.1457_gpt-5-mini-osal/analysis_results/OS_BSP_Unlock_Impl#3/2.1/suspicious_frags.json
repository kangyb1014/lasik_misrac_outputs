  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for unreachable-code under Rule 2.1: the local declaration (int status;) and the call that obtains the return value (status = pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);) are ordinary, reachable statements. The else branch and the call to pthread_setcancelstate(...) are executable code paths (they restore thread cancellability state) and are not syntactically unreachable. No other hidden or dead code constructs (e.g. code after return statements, unconditional infinite loops, or preprocessor-removed blocks) are present in the provided function, so they do not require further inspection for Rule 2.1."
