  "scenario": "No. The fragment strerror(status) does not call a <string.h> function that writes into a caller-supplied buffer and therefore does not itself risk accessing beyond the bounds of any object referenced by pointer parameters. In the supplied code BSP_DEBUG is defined empty so the expression is not evaluated at runtime. A concrete violation scenario (not present here) would be: copying the returned string into a too-small destination, e.g. strcpy(dest, strerror(status)) where dest is smaller than the error message, or using a <string.h> function that takes a pointer/length (memcpy/strcpy/strcat/strncat/etc.) with an incorrect size/length that causes an out-of-bounds write or read."
