  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for analyzing MISRA C string-handling safety:\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n  - Required to see the exact types and lifetimes of AccessMutex and AccessCancelState. In particular, confirm that &AccessMutex yields a pthread_mutex_t* (matching pthread_mutex_unlock prototype) and that AccessCancelState has a type compatible with pthread_setcancelstate. Also needed to see whether these fields are user-managed buffers or wrappers that might be used by string functions elsewhere.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock\n  - Prototype/implementation is required to confirm its parameter and return semantics. The code passes its return value to strerror; knowing whether pthread_mutex_unlock returns an errno-style positive error code or sets errno is necessary to determine correct use of strerror. While not itself a <string.h> function, misuse of its return value could lead to passing an invalid integer to strerror, which affects the string returned/used.\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate\n  - Prototype is needed to confirm expected argument types (int cancelstate, int *oldstate). Ensures AccessCancelState is being used correctly and that no hidden string operations occur via this call.\n\n- strerror\n  - The target rule concerns functions from <string.h>. strerror(strerror_r) is the only string function used here; its prototype/implementation is required to understand what it returns (pointer to static buffer, thread-safety variant, potential internal use of string functions) and whether passing the value returned by strerror into BSP_DEBUG could result in buffer accesses beyond object bounds. Also needed to know behavior for out-of-range errno values.\n\n- BSP_DEBUG\n  - This logging macro/function consumes the format string and the char* returned by strerror. Its implementation is essential: if BSP_DEBUG internally copies the string into a fixed-size buffer using string.h functions (strcpy/strncpy/strcat/etc.), that could be the site of a bounds violation even though this function only supplies the pointer. To prove or disprove any MISRA violation you must inspect BSP_DEBUG's handling of the %s argument and any internal use of string functions and buffer sizes.\n\n(Collectively these symbols let an analyzer confirm whether any <string.h> function is invoked with pointers/lengths that could access memory out of bounds \u2014 either directly (strerror usage) or indirectly inside BSP_DEBUG.)"
