  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not call any of the <string.h> functions listed in the rule and therefore do not present the specific buffer/bounds risk covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The call to pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex) merely returns an int status and does not itself perform any string handling. The pthread_setcancelstate(OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState, NULL) call does not use <string.h> functions or character buffers, and the macro definition (#define BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)) in the additional code indicates the debugging macro may be disabled, so there is no other invocation of string functions in this function body. Consequently, no other code fragments in this function need investigation under Rule 21.17."
