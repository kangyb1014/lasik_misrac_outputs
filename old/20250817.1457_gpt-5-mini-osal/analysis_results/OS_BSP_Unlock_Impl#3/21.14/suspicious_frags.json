  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl and found no use of memcmp or any explicit comparison of null-terminated strings using memcmp. The code only calls pthread_mutex_unlock, strerror (used solely to format an error message), and pthread_setcancelstate. None of these calls represent a memcmp comparison of C strings. There are no macros or inline memcmp usages present in the given snippet, so no fragments in this function require investigation for Rule 21.14. If memcmp use might exist in other files or in macros not shown here, those locations would need to be examined separately, but nothing in this provided code fragment violates or triggers Rule 21.14."
