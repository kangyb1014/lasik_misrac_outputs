  "explanation": "- BSP_DEBUG (macro and its expansion/implementation): The call in this function is BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status)). BSP_DEBUG may be a macro that expands to other project code (logging helpers) which could themselves call memcmp or compare null\u2011terminated strings. You must inspect the macro/body to see whether it uses memcmp on strings.\n- Any functions called by BSP_DEBUG (e.g. printf, fprintf, vsnprintf, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl): If BSP_DEBUG expands to or calls these helpers, their implementations must be checked for any use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. Include the concrete functions that BSP_DEBUG ultimately invokes.\n- strerror: Although part of the C library, strerror returns a C string and its use here appears only as a formatting argument. Still, include strerror (its declaration/usage) to confirm no project wrapper around it performs string comparisons with memcmp.\n- pthread_mutex_unlock: Include the declaration/usage so the analyzer can confirm the function call is not hiding or wrapping other project code that uses memcmp.\n- pthread_setcancelstate: Same rationale as pthread_mutex_unlock \u2014 include the symbol to confirm no hidden string comparisons in wrappers/macros.\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (definition: AccessMutex, AccessCancelState): The global structure definition (types of AccessMutex and AccessCancelState) is required to inspect any associated macros or accessors that might expand into code that compares strings with memcmp.\n- memcmp: Include the memcmp symbol so the analyzer can search the relevant translation unit(s) and the expansion targets (BSP_DEBUG and its callees) for any direct or indirect uses of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nThese symbols together let the next analyst determine whether any code actually executed (directly in OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl or via macro expansion / called helpers) uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, which would violate the MISRA rule."
