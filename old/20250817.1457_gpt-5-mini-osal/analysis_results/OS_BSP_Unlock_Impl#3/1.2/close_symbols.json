  "explanation": "For assessing MISRA C rule \u2018Language extensions should not be used\u2019 you must inspect definitions that could hide compiler-specific extensions. Explaination for each required symbol: \n\n- BSP_DEBUG (macro or function definition): BSP_DEBUG is invoked with a printf-style format; its definition may be a macro or inline function that could use compiler extensions (GNU statement-expressions, typeof, __attribute__, asm, or non-standard variadic-macro forms). You need the exact definition to confirm it uses only standard C constructs.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal (global variable definition and its struct/type): The global object\u2019s type and its member declarations (AccessMutex, AccessCancelState) could be declared with compiler-specific attributes (e.g., packed, aligned, __attribute__ annotations) or use non-standard type extensions. The full definition is required to check for such extensions.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock (prototype / declaration from <pthread.h>): Confirming this is the standard POSIX prototype (and not a project-local wrapper declared with compiler extensions) ensures the call itself does not rely on non-standard function attributes or calling conventions.\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate (prototype / declaration from <pthread.h>): Same reason as above \u2014 verify the declaration is standard and free of compiler-specific extensions.\n\n- strerror (prototype / declaration from <string.h>): The implementation or macro-wrapping of strerror might use extensions; the exact declaration/definition is needed to ensure no language extensions are used when called here.\n\n- NULL (macro definition): NULL is used in the call to pthread_setcancelstate. Some projects define NULL in non-standard ways; inspecting its definition ensures no compiler-specific extension is introduced via this macro.\n\nThese symbols (and their header/source definitions) are the minimal items needed to determine whether this function or its immediate dependencies employ any documented compiler language extensions."
