  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments: The target function and related definitions contain no pointer declarations, pointer parameters, pointer returns, or pointer expressions. Rule 8.13 concerns const-qualification of pointer target types; there are no pointer types to inspect in the provided code. The only symbol shown, OS_SUCCESS, is an integer macro. The function parameter Status is an integer (int32) and exit is invoked with integer constants; therefore MISRA C Rule 8.13 is not applicable to any fragment in the provided code."
