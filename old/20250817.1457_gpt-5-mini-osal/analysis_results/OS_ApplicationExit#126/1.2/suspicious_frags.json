  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function signature uses a user typedef int32 (which is defined as int32_t \u2014 a standard fixed-width integer type), not a compiler-specific type. The calls to exit and the macros EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE are standard C library facilities. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), variable-length-array compiler extensions, trailing-return types, or other vendor-specific keywords or pragmas. The macro OS_SUCCESS is a simple integer constant. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2."
