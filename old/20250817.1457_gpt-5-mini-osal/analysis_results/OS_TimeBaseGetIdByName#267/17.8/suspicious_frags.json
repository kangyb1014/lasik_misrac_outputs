  "explanation": "The remaining fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.8 because they do not modify the function parameters themselves: - The declaration and initialization lines (int32 return_code; osal_objtype_t objtype;) only declare local variables. - objtype = OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl(OS_TaskGetId_Impl()); calls functions and assigns to a local variable, it does not modify timer_id or timebase_name. - The if (objtype == OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE) { return OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE; } block only reads the local objtype and returns; it does not alter parameter variables. - return return_code; only returns a local value. The three flagged fragments involve macros or a function call that take the parameter identifiers (timer_id and timebase_name) and therefore could, depending on their definitions/implementations, perform an assignment to the pointer parameters themselves; these deserve investigation to ensure the pointer variables are not being reassigned (only the pointed-to objects may be modified per Rule 17.8)."
