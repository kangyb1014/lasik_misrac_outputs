  "explanation": "timebase_name is already const-qualified (const char *), so it does not need investigation. Other local variables (return_code, objtype) are non-pointer scalar types and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13. Calls that do not pass pointer arguments (e.g., OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl(OS_TaskGetId_Impl())) only use/return scalar identifiers and therefore do not implicate pointer const-qualification. The selected fragments cover all places where a non-const pointer from this function is declared or propagated; no other pointer usages exist in the function that would be candidates for const-qualification."
