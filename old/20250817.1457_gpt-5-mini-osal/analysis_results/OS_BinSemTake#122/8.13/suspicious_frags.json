  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could instead point to const-qualified objects. In this function the only places producing pointers are the address-of uses (&token) passed to other functions. No pointer variables are declared locally (OS_object_token_t token is an object, not a pointer), sem_id and return_code are passed/used by value, and the function return type is a scalar. Therefore there are no other pointer usages in this snippet that could be qualified const. The two call sites above should be investigated to determine whether the callee functions modify the token (requiring a non-const pointer) or could accept a pointer-to-const instead."
