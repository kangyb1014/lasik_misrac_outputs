  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The only function parameter is sem_id and it is only used as an argument (passed by value) to OS_ObjectIdGetById; there is no assignment or modification of sem_id in this function. The token variable is a local object; taking its address (&token) and passing that pointer to other functions is allowed (the rule permits modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter, but not modification of the pointer parameter itself). There are no pointer parameters declared in OS_BinSemTake that are reassigned, and no statements like sem_id = ... or other modifications of function parameters. Therefore no fragments in this function need investigation for Rule 17.8."
