  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: a function definition, local variable declarations, typedefs (mapping int32_t to int32 and a struct typedef), macro use, a function call, the address-of operator, an if statement, and a return statement. There are no occurrences of common compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler, extended integer types beyond standard typedefs, or other vendor-specific keywords. The visible macro and type names (e.g. OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, OS_ObjectIdGetById) could expand to platform-specific code, but their definitions were not provided; based on the shown code there is no evidence of use of a documented compiler language extension. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
