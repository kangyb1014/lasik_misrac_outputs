  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided function and the related type/macro definitions. There are no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the shown code. In particular:\n- No compiler-specific keywords or attributes such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof (GNU extension), or other vendor-specific extensions are present.\n- No statement expressions ({ ... }) or nested functions (GCC extension) are used.\n- No variable length arrays, designated initializers, or other C99/C11 features that are compiler-dependent appear here; the typedefs (int32 from int32_t, uint32, osal_id_t) are standard typedef uses based on stdint types, not extensions.\n- The forward typedef (typedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t), macros (OS_SUCCESS), and normal function calls/returns are standard C.\n\nGiven the snippet and the additional definitions provided, there are no fragments that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions). If there are other files or usage of compiler-specific pragmas/attributes elsewhere, those would need separate review."
