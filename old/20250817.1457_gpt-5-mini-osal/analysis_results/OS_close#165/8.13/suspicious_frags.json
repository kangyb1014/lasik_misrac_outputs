  "explanation": "The rule targets pointers that could be to const-qualified types. In this function the only pointer usages are the three occurrences passing &token to other routines. There are no other pointer variables, no pointer arithmetic, no pointer returns, and no literal strings or array-to-pointer decays in this code fragment. The parameter filedes is passed by value (osal_id_t) and return_code is an integer, so they are not relevant to this rule. Therefore only the three calls that pass &token need investigation to determine whether the callee parameters could (or should) be const-qualified; no other fragments in this function are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
