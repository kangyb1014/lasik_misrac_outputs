  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_SocketOpen code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_SocketOpen.\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketOpen(osal_id_t *sock_id, OS_SocketDomain_t Domain, OS_SocketType_t Type)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t            token;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    int32                        return_code;\n\n    /* Check for NULL pointers */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(sock_id);\n\n    /* Note - the common ObjectIdAllocate routine will lock the object type and leave it locked. */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, NULL, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, token);\n\n        /* Save all the data to our own internal table */\n        memset(stream, 0, sizeof(OS_stream_internal_record_t));\n        stream->socket_domain = Domain;\n        stream->socket_type   = Type;\n\n        /* Now call the OS-specific implementation.

Therefore removing the initial os_proto = 0; would not change program behaviour. This makes the assignment dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_SocketOpen_Log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1994.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        va_list ap;\n        va_start(ap, fmt);\n        vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n        fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n        va_end(ap);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nint32 OS_SocketOpen(osal_id_t *sock_id, OS_SocketDomain_t Domain, OS_SocketType_t Type)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t            token;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n    int32                        return_code;\n\n    /* Log entry and arguments */\n    OS_SocketOpen_Log(\"ENTER: OS_SocketOpen sock_id=%p Domain=%d Type=%d\", (void *)sock_id, (int)Domain, (int)Type);\n\n    /* Check for NULL pointers */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(sock_id);\n\n    OS_SocketOpen_Log(\"After pointer check: sock_id=%p\", (void *)sock_id);\n\n    /* Note - the common ObjectIdAllocate routine will lock the object type and leave it locked. */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, NULL, &token);\n    OS_SocketOpen_Log(\"OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew returned %ld\", (long)return_code);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        stream = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_stream_table, token);\n\n        /* Use pointer form for logging the token since OS_object_token_t is an aggregate type */\n        OS_SocketOpen_Log(\"Allocated token=%p stream=%p\", (void *)&token, (void *)stream);\n\n        /* Save all the data to our own internal table */\n        memset(stream, 0, sizeof(OS_stream_internal_record_t));\n        stream->socket_domain = Domain;\n        stream->socket_type   = Type;\n\n        OS_SocketOpen_Log(\"After init: stream=%p domain=%d type=%d\", (void *)stream, (int)stream->socket_domain, (int)stream->socket_type);\n\n        /* Now call the OS-specific implementation.

  "explanation": "The claim is not supported by the material provided. The OS_SocketOpen source shown in the target_code does not contain any os_proto = 0 assignment (nor any os_proto variable), so Agent A's specific scenario cannot be confirmed from this snippet. The added test logging also produced no evidence (the function was apparently not exercised), so it does not substantiate the claimed violation. \n\nThat said, as a general principle: if a plain assignment to a non-volatile local variable (e.g. os_proto = 0) is executed unconditionally and every control path that later uses that variable assigns it a new value first (or returns early), then the initial assignment would have no effect and would be dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Before declaring a real violation you must verify the actual source: ensure the variable is not used prior to the later assignments, is not volatile, its address is not taken, and there are no other observable side-effects that depend on the initial write. None of those checks were demonstrated here, and the provided code does not contain the assignment in question, so the report is not correct for the given code."
