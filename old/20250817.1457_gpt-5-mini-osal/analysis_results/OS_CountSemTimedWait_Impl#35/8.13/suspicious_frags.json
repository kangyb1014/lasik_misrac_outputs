  "explanation": "Other pointer-related code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already const-qualified (const OS_object_token_t *token), and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already accepts a const OS_object_token_t * so passing the token does not discard const. The local timespec variable (ts) is written by OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime, so it cannot be declared const. The semaphore table/storage must remain mutable because semaphore operations (e.g. sem_timedwait) modify the semaphore state; therefore the table and the semaphore field cannot be const-qualified. Other local variables (result, msecs) are non-pointer or intentionally mutable and are not relevant to the const-pointer rule."
