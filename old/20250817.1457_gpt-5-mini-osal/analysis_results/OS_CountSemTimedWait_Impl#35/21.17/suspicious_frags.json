  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the provided fragments. The function OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl only calls OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime and sem_timedwait and performs simple integer/enum handling; OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime manipulates fields of a struct timespec (tv_sec, tv_nsec) with explicit bounds checking for the nanoseconds rollover, not any string/byte-buffer operations. The provided helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply reads an index field from the token and the object-table access macro is not shown to invoke any string functions. Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (out-of-bounds accesses caused by <string.h> routines), so nothing needs to be forwarded for investigation under that rule."
