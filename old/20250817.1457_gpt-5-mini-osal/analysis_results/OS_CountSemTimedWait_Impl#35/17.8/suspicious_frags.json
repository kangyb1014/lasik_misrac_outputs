  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies any function parameter. The parameters are: (1) token \u2014 a pointer to const OS_object_token_t; it is only dereferenced (*token) and passed to the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, not assigned to or altered; the pointer itself is not modified. (2) msecs \u2014 a scalar passed by value to OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime and not assigned to anywhere in the function. Calls such as sem_timedwait(&impl->id, &ts) or OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime(msecs, &ts) only pass addresses of local objects (ts, impl->id) or pass msecs by value; they do not modify the parameter variables token or msecs. Therefore there are no fragments that warrant investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
