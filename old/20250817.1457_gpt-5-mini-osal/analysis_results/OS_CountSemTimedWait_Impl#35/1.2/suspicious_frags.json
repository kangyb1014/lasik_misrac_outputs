  "explanation": "I examined the provided function and related symbols for usage of compiler-specific language extensions. I did not find any constructs that are explicitly documented compiler extensions (for example, no occurrences of GCC or MSVC extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ...; }), nested functions, anonymous structs/unions as non-standard, __extension__, Microsoft __declspec, or other vendor-specific keywords). The code uses standard C features only (regular typedefs, macros, standard arithmetic and control flow, and a static inline helper which is standard since C99). The use of POSIX APIs (sem_timedwait, clock_gettime, timespec, sem_t) are library/OS functions and POSIX interfaces, not extensions of the C language by the compiler itself, and thus are outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 concerning compiler language extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need to be investigated for compiler language-extension usage."
