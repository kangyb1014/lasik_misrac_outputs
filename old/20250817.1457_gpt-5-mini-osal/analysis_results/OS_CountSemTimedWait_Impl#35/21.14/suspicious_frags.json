  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl and the related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp nor any other code performing raw memory comparisons of C strings. The code uses sem_timedwait, errno, struct timespec arithmetic, and an object-table macro; the token type and internal record use structured types (not C strings). I also searched the additional snippets (OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_count_sem_table, and typedefs) and found no memcmp usage or string comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If memcmp calls exist elsewhere in the project, those locations should be reported, but none are present in the provided code."
