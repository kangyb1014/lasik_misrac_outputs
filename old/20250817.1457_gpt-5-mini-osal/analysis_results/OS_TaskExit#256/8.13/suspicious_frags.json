  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not involve taking or passing pointers to objects that could be const-qualified. Specifically:\n- The local scalar declaration of task_id and its use (assignment from OS_TaskGetId_Impl()) do not involve pointer-to-object types.\n- Calls that do not pass addresses (OS_TaskGetId_Impl(); OS_TaskExit_Impl();) do not present pointer const-qualification concerns.\n- Control-flow and comments contain no pointer usage.\n\nThe only places where an object address is taken or a pointer is passed are the listed fragments; those should be reviewed to determine whether the callee should accept a pointer to a const-qualified OS_object_token_t or whether the object is legitimately modified and thus must remain non-const."
