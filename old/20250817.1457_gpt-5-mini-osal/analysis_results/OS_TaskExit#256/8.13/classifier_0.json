  "scenario": "No violation: in the fragment `OS_object_token_t token;` token is an object instance, not a pointer type, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (about pointers pointing to const-qualified types) does not apply. (If, alternatively, `OS_object_token_t` were actually a typedef for a pointer type \u2014 e.g. `typedef struct S *OS_object_token_t;` \u2014 then declaring `OS_object_token_t token;` would create a pointer-to-mutable and could violate Rule 8.13; in that case the pointer should point to a const-qualified type when modification of the pointee is not intended.)"
