  "explanation": "The function OS_TaskExit has no incoming parameters, so there are no direct modifications of its own parameters to check. The local assignment task_id = OS_TaskGetId_Impl(); and the call OS_TaskExit_Impl(); do not involve modifying function parameters and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 17.8. The only places that could potentially violate Rule 17.8 are the calls that pass the address of the local token (&token) to other functions: OS_ObjectIdGetById(..., &token), OS_TaskDetach_Impl(&token), and OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(..., &token). These calls should be investigated because the called functions receive pointer parameters; while they are allowed to modify the object pointed-to, they must not modify the pointer parameter itself. Other lines in the snippet are local-variable usage or parameterless calls and do not warrant further review for this rule."
