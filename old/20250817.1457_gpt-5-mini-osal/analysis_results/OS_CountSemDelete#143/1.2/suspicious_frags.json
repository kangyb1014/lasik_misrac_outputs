  "explanation": "I found no explicit use of compiler language extensions in the provided code fragments. Specifically:\n\n- No use of GCC/clang/other vendor-specific keywords or tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, asm, __inline__, __extension__, __typeof__, __builtin_*, or nested functions.\n- No statement expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, no designated initializers with compiler-only extensions, and no non-standard storage-class or type qualifiers.\n- All typedefs and function declarations/definitions use standard C constructs (e.g., typedefs for int32/int32_t, osal_id_t, normal function prototypes and pointer usage).\n- Standard POSIX call sem_destroy is used (not a language extension).\n\nThe only site that could potentially hide an extension is the macro invocation:\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token);\nMacro definitions are not included in the supplied code; if that macro itself is implemented using a compiler extension (for example, using typeof or statement-expression macros), that would be an extension \u2014 but there is no evidence of such an extension in the shown source. Because the rule requires reporting only when an extension is actually used (and explicitly documented as an extension), and no such constructs appear in the provided snippets, no fragments are flagged for investigation."
