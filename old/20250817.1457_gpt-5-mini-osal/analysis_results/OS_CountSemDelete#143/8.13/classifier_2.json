  "scenario": "This fragment itself is not necessarily a violation. If OS_CountSemDelete_Impl legitimately needs to modify the token (e.g. to change lock state or mark deletion) then taking a non-const OS_object_token_t * is correct and Rule 8.13 is not violated. However, if OS_CountSemDelete_Impl does not modify the object referred to by token (its prototype is OS_CountSemDelete_Impl(OS_object_token_t *token) but it never writes through the pointer), then the pointer should be to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *) and the current code would violate Rule 8.13."
