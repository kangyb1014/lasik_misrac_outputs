  "explanation": "All pointer uses in this function are the three places where the address of 'token' is passed. These should be investigated to determine whether the corresponding function parameter types could or should be 'const OS_object_token_t *' instead of a non-const pointer. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: 'token' is declared as a non-const object because it is (presumably) initialized/modified by OS_ObjectIdGetById; 'sem_id' and 'return_code' are scalar value parameters/variables (not pointers) and thus not relevant to the pointer const-qualification rule; there are no other pointer expressions in the function."
