  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the presented code fragment. The source contains only standard C constructs: a function definition, local variable declarations, if-statement, structure member access, comparisons, function/macro calls and comments. There are no occurrences of common compiler-extension markers such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, __thread, inline assembly, statement-expressions ({ ... }) or other vendor-specific keywords that would directly indicate a language extension.\n\nNote: Several identifiers here are macros or project typedefs (for example OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ModuleUnload_Impl, int32, OS_module_internal_record_t, OS_object_token_t). Those macro/typedef definitions are not visible in this fragment and could themselves use compiler-specific extensions internally. However, invoking a macro or using a typedef in this code does not by itself prove use of a language extension, so these call sites are not flagged. To fully confirm compliance, the definitions of those macros/typedefs should be reviewed separately; only their definitions (not the call sites shown) could contain the language extensions that Rule 1.2 forbids."
