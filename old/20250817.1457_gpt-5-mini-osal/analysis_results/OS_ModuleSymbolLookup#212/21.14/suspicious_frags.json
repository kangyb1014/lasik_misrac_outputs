  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code fragments. All string comparisons in the snippets use strcmp (e.g. in OS_SymbolLookup_Static: strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) and strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName)), which does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Other operations (dlsym/dlerror, pointer checks, assignments) do not involve memcmp-based string comparisons. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 21.14. If additional source files exist, they should be scanned for any memcmp usages comparing null-terminated strings, but none are present in the provided excerpts."
