  "explanation": "Only pointer declarations and uses are relevant for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Non-pointer local variables (e.g. integer status variables and the token variable declared as an object, not a pointer) do not fall under this rule and therefore need no investigation. Pointers that are already const-qualified are not suspicious and need not be reported. Pointer arguments that are clearly intended as output parameters (i.e. passed to functions to be written/populated) must be non-const and thus are expected to be non-const; these are not further flagged here. Macro invocations and calls whose pointer parameter types are defined elsewhere were omitted from the suspicious list when the pointer qualification cannot be determined from this fragment alone. The listed fragments are those locations in the shown code where pointer types are visible and where const-qualification might reasonably be applicable and therefore warrant investigation."
