  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided function modifies any function parameter. Specifically:\n- Function signature: path is declared as const char * (pointer itself is not modified in this function, and the pointed-to object is const), and access is a by-value uint32 parameter.\n- There are no assignments to path or access anywhere in the body (no statements like path = ..., *path = ..., access = ...). The only assignments are to the local variable return_code and the local array local_path.\n- Calls to OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path) and OS_DirCreate_Impl(local_path, access) pass parameters by value/pointer but do not themselves constitute modification of this function\u2019s parameters; any modification performed inside those functions would need to be checked in their own implementations.\n- The return statement returns a local variable; it does not modify any parameter.\nTherefore, no fragments in this function need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
