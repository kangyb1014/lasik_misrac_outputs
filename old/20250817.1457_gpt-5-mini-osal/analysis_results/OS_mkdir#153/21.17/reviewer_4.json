  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_mkdir code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_mkdir.\n```c\nint32 OS_mkdir(const char *path, uint32 access)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    char  local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_DirCreate_Impl(local_path, access);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The call memchr(name_ptr, 0, OS_MAX_FILE_NAME) can read up to OS_MAX_FILE_NAME bytes starting at name_ptr. name_ptr points into VirtualPath just after the last '/'. Although OS_strnlen(VirtualPath, OS_MAX_PATH_LEN) ensured a terminating '\\0' exists within the first OS_MAX_PATH_LEN bytes, it does not guarantee that there are OS_MAX_FILE_NAME bytes available from name_ptr. If the filename (characters from name_ptr up to and including the terminator) is shorter than OS_MAX_FILE_NAME, memchr will attempt to access bytes beyond the end of the VirtualPath object, causing an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. Example: with OS_MAX_FILE_NAME = 10 and VirtualPath = \"/dir/x\" (only 2 bytes including '\\0' from name_ptr), memchr will read 10 bytes starting at name_ptr and overruns the object. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic size_t safe_strnlen(const char *s, size_t max)\n{\n    size_t i = 0;\n    if (s == (const char *)0)\n    {\n        return 0u;\n    }\n\n    while (i < max && s[i] != '\\0')\n    {\n        ++i;\n    }\n\n    return i;\n}\nstatic void append_log_entry(const char *event,\n                             const char *path, size_t path_len,\n                             const char *local_path, size_t local_len,\n                             long return_code, unsigned long access)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1231.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == (FILE *)0)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Print the event, the path (bounded by path_len), the local_path (bounded by local_len),\n     * and key numeric state.

  "explanation": "The OS_mkdir implementation shown does not call any <string.h> functions itself \u2014 it only declares a local buffer, calls OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path) and then OS_DirCreate_Impl(local_path, access). Therefore, OS_mkdir as presented cannot directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The scenario described by agent A refers to a memchr(name_ptr, 0, OS_MAX_FILE_NAME) usage that would be inside some path\u2011handling routine (presumably OS_TranslatePath or a helper it calls). If such a memchr call is issued with a fixed length OS_MAX_FILE_NAME starting at name_ptr without ensuring that at least OS_MAX_FILE_NAME bytes of the same object are accessible at name_ptr, then that code would indeed risk reading past the end of the object and would violate Rule 21.17. But that is a problem in the implementation of the path translation routine, not in the OS_mkdir wrapper shown. To resolve the issue one must inspect and correct the memchr usage in OS_TranslatePath (or the relevant helper) \u2014 for example by computing the remaining bytes in the object and using that as the length argument, or otherwise ensuring the object is large enough. In short: the specific report that OS_mkdir violates Rule 21.17 is not correct; the underlying concern may be valid for the translation function, which should be reviewed."
