  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_mkdir code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_mkdir.\n```c\nint32 OS_mkdir(const char *path, uint32 access)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    char  local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    return_code = OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_DirCreate_Impl(local_path, access);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:OS_strnlen calls memchr(VirtualPath, 0, OS_MAX_PATH_LEN). If VirtualPath points to an object whose length (storage size) is less than OS_MAX_PATH_LEN and there is no null byte within that object's bounds, memchr may read past the end of that object while searching for a 0 byte. For example, if a caller passes a pointer to a char buffer of size 16 which happens not to contain a '\\0' within those 16 bytes, the memchr call can access beyond the 16-byte object (up to OS_MAX_PATH_LEN), violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\ntypedef int32_t int32;\ntypedef uint32_t uint32;\nextern int32 OS_TranslatePath(const char *path, char *local_path);\nextern int32 OS_DirCreate_Impl(const char *local_path, uint32 access);\nstatic void probe_log_open(const char *tag, const char *path_ptr_str, uint32 access)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1231.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"[OS_mkdir] ENTER tag=%s path_ptr=%s access=%u\\n\", tag, path_ptr_str ? path_ptr_str : \"(null)\", (unsigned)access);\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\nstatic void probe_log_translate_result(const char *path_ptr_str, int32 translate_rc, const char *local_path)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1231.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"[OS_mkdir] OS_TranslatePath returned %d for path_ptr=%s\\n\", (int)translate_rc, path_ptr_str ? path_ptr_str : \"(null)\");\n\n        if (translate_rc == OS_SUCCESS && local_path != NULL)\n        {\n            /* local_path is a local buffer in this function; it is safe to\n               measure and log up to OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN bytes. */\n            size_t ln = strnlen(local_path, (size_t)OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN);\n            fprintf(f, \"[OS_mkdir] Translated local_path (len=%zu):\\n\", ln);\n\n            /* Log as a visible string (may be truncated) */\n            fprintf(f, \"[OS_mkdir] local_path_str=\\\"\");\n            for (size_t i = 0; i < ln; ++i)\n            {\n                unsigned char c = (unsigned char)local_path[i];\n                /* Print printable characters directly; otherwise use \\xHH */\n                if (c >= 0x20 && c <= 0x7e)\n                    fputc(c, f);\n                else\n                    fprintf(f, \"\\\\x%02X\", c);\n            }\n            fprintf(f, \"\\\"\\n\");\n\n            /* Also provide a hex dump for byte-level inspection. */\n            fprintf(f, \"[OS_mkdir] local_path_hex=\");\n            for (size_t i = 0; i < ln; ++i)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"%02X\", (unsigned char)local_path[i]);\n                if (i + 1 < ln) fprintf(f, \":\");\n            }\n            fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n        }\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\nstatic void probe_log_dircreate_result(const char *path_ptr_str, int32 dircreate_rc)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1231.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"[OS_mkdir] OS_DirCreate_Impl returned %d for path_ptr=%s\\n\", (int)dircreate_rc, path_ptr_str ? path_ptr_str : \"(null)\");\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nint32 OS_mkdir(const char *path, uint32 access)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n    char  local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN];\n\n    /* Log entry: we record the pointer value as an address string so that\n       test harnesses can correlate the pointer with allocated object sizes\n       or with fuzzing inputs.

  "explanation": "The claim that OS_mkdir violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 is not correct. The OS_mkdir code shown does not itself call any of the <string.h> functions in a way that can read past the bounds of an object. It simply allocates a local buffer local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN] and calls OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path) and then OS_DirCreate_Impl(local_path,...). The additional test/logging code calls strnlen(local_path, OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN) on a local array of that exact size, which is a safe bounded use.\n\nThe scenario described by agent A (memchr(VirtualPath, 0, OS_MAX_PATH_LEN) reading beyond the storage object if VirtualPath points to a smaller non-terminated buffer) would indeed be a violation of Rule 21.17 \u2014 but that violation would occur in the implementation of OS_strnlen/OS_TranslatePath (or wherever memchr is used), not in OS_mkdir itself. In other words: the out\u2011of\u2011bounds risk is in the callee implementation that inspects the caller-supplied pointer, not in the OS_mkdir function shown. Therefore the report attributing the violation to OS_mkdir is incorrect."
