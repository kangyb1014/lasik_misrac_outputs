  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter 'const char *path' is already const-qualified, so it complies; there are no other pointer declarations or pointer assignments in this function; non-pointer objects (return_code, access) are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. The only pointer-related items in this function are the local array 'local_path' (used as a char* when passed to functions) and the two calls that pass it; these are the relevant fragments to investigate for whether the receiving APIs should use/accept const-qualified pointers."
