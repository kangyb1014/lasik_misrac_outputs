First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided code fragment. Rule 14.2 concerns the structure of for loops (first, second, third clauses, loop counter and loop-control flags); none of these syntactic constructs appear here. The snippet contains: declarations, function calls (OS_TranslatePath, OS_DirCreate_Impl), an if statement, and a return. There are no macros or inline constructs in the snippet that suggest an embedded for loop (OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN is a size constant, not a loop). Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that need to be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. (Note: to fully assess overall project compliance, the implementations of the called functions would need separate review, but they are outside the provided code and thus not part of this inspection.)"
