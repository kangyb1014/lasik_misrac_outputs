  "explanation": "The assignment of TypeName to ContentTypeStr should be investigated because it may discard the const qualifier (TypeName is const char *). The function signature is included to show the source of the const-qualified pointer being assigned. Other pointer usages in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - StubPtr is used to modify the stub table (members are written), so it must be a pointer to a non-const UT_StubTableEntry_t and cannot/should not be const-qualified. - StubPtr->Data.Buff.BasePtr is allocated (malloc) and written to (memset), so it must point to a non-const (writable) buffer. - Assignments and checks involving StubPtr (getting entries, clearing entries, setting EntryType, FuncKey, ModeFlags, TotalSize, Position) all modify the pointee, so const qualification is not appropriate. - Other parameters (FuncKey, ReturnSize) are not pointers. No other pointer-to-non-const occurrences that would imply missing const qualification under Rule 8.13 are present in this function."
