  "explanation": "To decide if OS_IdleLoop_Impl is dead code you must show both reachability and whether its removal would change program behaviour (including timing/blocking semantics). The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- OS_IdleLoop: the direct caller; need its implementation to confirm when/if OS_IdleLoop_Impl is invoked and under what conditions (e.g. conditional calls, alternative flows).\n\n- OS_Application_Run: higher-level caller of OS_IdleLoop; needed to establish whether the idle loop (and thus OS_IdleLoop_Impl) is reachable from program entry and under which runtime scenarios.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: another callee of OS_IdleLoop; including this shows alternate behaviour in OS_IdleLoop and helps determine if OS_IdleLoop_Impl can be omitted without affecting OS_IdleLoop's observable effects.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars (type/definition): provides the type/layout and declaration site of NormalSigMask so you can tell what sigsuspend(&NormalSigMask) actually receives (sigset_t pointer, etc.).\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (definition and all assignments/initializers): you must know how NormalSigMask is computed and when it is written. If NormalSigMask encodes a deliberate mask used by other threads/timers, removing the sigsuspend call could change signal delivery timing and thus behaviour.\n\n- sigsuspend (library function / its semantics): the semantic effect of this call (temporarily replacing the signal mask and blocking until a signal) is central to whether the call has side effects. If it only blocks, removal may change timing; if it also alters masks, signal delivery semantics change. Documenting sigsuspend behaviour is necessary to judge whether the call is meaningful.\n\n- sigwait (library function / call sites): the code comments reference other threads doing sigwait on RT signals. You need to find those sigwait call sites to understand the inter-thread signal protocol and whether masking here is required for correct operation.\n\n- Task initialization code that computes/sets NormalSigMask: the comment says NormalSigMask is calculated during task init. The exact code that sets this mask is needed to determine which signals are masked/unmasked and whether the sigsuspend call uses a nontrivial mask that affects behaviour.\n\n- Timebase thread creation / implementation (threads that wait on RT signals via sigwait): to confirm the design the comment describes (timers use RT signals and are handled by a dedicated thread), you must inspect those threads. That interaction can make the sigsuspend call essential (not dead) because it synchronizes with those signal-handling threads.\n\nCollectively these symbols allow you to determine (a) whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl is reachable at runtime and (b) whether its single operation (sigsuspend with NormalSigMask) has observable effects (blocking/timing or signal-delivery semantics) such that removing it would change program behaviour (i.e. it is not dead code)."
