Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I did not include function declarations, comments, or other non-executable text because those are not candidates for Rule 2.2 (initialization vs assignment note and comments are not executable). The function headers and definitions themselves (e.g. void OS_IdleLoop_Impl(void), void OS_IdleLoop(), void OS_Application_Run(void), void UT_ExecuteBasicHandler(...)) are not inherently dead code \u2014 they are reachable/used (OS_Application_Run calls OS_IdleLoop, OS_IdleLoop calls OS_IdleLoop_Impl, and UT_ExecuteBasicHandler is an entry point for the test framework). The comment block inside OS_IdleLoop_Impl is explanatory only and not executable. There is no evidence of unreachable code blocks in the provided snippets (no return-after-return, no code following unconditional jumps, etc.), so those constructs were not flagged. The selected fragments above are the executed operations most likely to be unnecessary or redundant and therefore warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
