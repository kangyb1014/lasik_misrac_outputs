  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_IdleLoop_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_IdleLoop_Impl(void)\n{\n    /*\n     * Unblock signals and wait for something to occur\n     *\n     * Note - \"NormalSigMask\" was calculated during task init to be the original signal mask\n     * of the process PLUS all \"RT\" signals.  The RT signals are used by timers, so we want\n     * to keep them masked here (this is different than the original POSIX impl).

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in general: the conditional call to UT_SetHandlerFunction depends on run-time inputs (UT_GetStubEntry and DefaultHandler) and may execute, so it is not intrinsically dead. Specific violation scenario: if, for all possible executions in the project, UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_FINAL_HANDLER) is guaranteed to return non-NULL (for example because every handler is always pre-registered during initialization) or DefaultHandler is guaranteed to be NULL, then the body of the if statement would never be executed and the call to UT_SetHandlerFunction could be removed without changing program behaviour \u2014 this would constitute dead code and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
