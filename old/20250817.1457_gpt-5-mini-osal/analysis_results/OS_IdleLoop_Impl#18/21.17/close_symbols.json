  "explanation": "- POSIX_GlobalVars: The object holding NormalSigMask must be inspected to see how NormalSigMask is declared/stored (is it a plain sigset_t member, an array, or something else). This determines whether taking its address could be passing an incompatible pointer that might later be used by string functions.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: The exact member being passed to sigsuspend \u2014 its type, layout and storage duration are needed to ensure the call is passing the correct pointer type and size, and that there is no potential for out\u2011of\u2011bounds access if some code treats it as a character buffer.\n\n- sigset_t (typedef/definition): The underlying definition of sigset_t (often an integral/array type) is required to know its size and representation. MISRA string\u2011bounds violations concern functions taking char*/void* \u2014 verifying sigset_t is not an alias to such a type is important.\n\n- sigsuspend (declaration + any project wrapper/implementation/macro): You must inspect the declared prototype and any local implementation or wrapper for sigsuspend (or a project-specific function that replaces it). If the call is to the standard sigsuspend, it does not use string.h functions; but if a project wrapper or macro redirects the call to another function, that implementation must be checked for use of string functions and any risky pointer arithmetic.\n\n- any macros or inline wrappers that redefine/expand sigsuspend in this translation unit: A macro could rename or expand the call to something that uses string handling functions. Checking for such macros/inline functions ensures you analyze the actual callees and not just the visible call text.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no direct calls to string.h functions. The above symbols are sufficient to determine whether the argument passed or the actual implementation called could introduce string.h usage or out\u2011of\u2011bounds pointer accesses."
