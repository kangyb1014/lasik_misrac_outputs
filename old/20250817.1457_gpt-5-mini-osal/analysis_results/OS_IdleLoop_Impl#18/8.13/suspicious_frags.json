  "explanation": "The only pointer expression in this function is the address-of operator applied to POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask in the sigsuspend call; this is the sole location where a pointer to a (non-const) object is produced and thus may need review under Rule 8.13. The rest of the function is comments or a non-pointer function signature (void OS_IdleLoop_Impl(void)) and contains no other pointer declarations, pointer arithmetic, or pointer-to-data uses that would be relevant to Rule 8.13, so there are no additional fragments in this function that require investigation."
