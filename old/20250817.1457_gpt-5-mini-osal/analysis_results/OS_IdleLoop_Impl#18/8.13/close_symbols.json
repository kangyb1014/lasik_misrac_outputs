  "explanation": "- POSIX_GlobalVars (declaration/definition): needed to locate the struct/variable that contains NormalSigMask and to inspect its storage class and qualifiers.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (member declaration): required to know the exact type of the object passed (&NormalSigMask) and whether the member itself is declared const-qualified.\n- sigsuspend (function prototype): required to see the parameter type (does sigsuspend take const sigset_t * or sigset_t *). MISRA rule concerns whether the pointer parameter should be const-qualified and whether passing &NormalSigMask matches that.\n- sigset_t (typedef/definition): to understand the underlying type pointed to (is it an array, scalar, struct?) and how const qualification applies to it.\n- Function(s) that initialize or modify POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (task-init code / any writers): to determine whether NormalSigMask is ever written/modified elsewhere; if it is mutable, it cannot be made const \u2014 this is essential for deciding if a const-qualified pointer is possible/appropriate.\n- Any call sites or functions that take a non-const pointer/address of NormalSigMask (definitions): to find other code that relies on mutability (e.g., passing a non-const sigset_t *) which would prevent making the object or pointer const.\n\nThese symbols let an analyst determine (1) whether the callee expects a const pointer, (2) whether the object passed could be declared const (i.e., is never modified), and (3) whether changing const-qualification would break other uses \u2014 all necessary to check compliance with the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointer types."
