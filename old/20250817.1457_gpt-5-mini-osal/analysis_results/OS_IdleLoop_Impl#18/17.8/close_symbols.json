  "explanation": "1) sigsuspend (function prototype/declaration) \u2014 needed to know the exact parameter type and const-qualification of the function called (e.g. int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask)). MISRA rule concerns modification of function parameters, so the prototype tells us whether the callee receives a pointer-to-const (and whether any pointer parameter could be legally modified inside that callee). 2) sigset_t (typedef/type definition) \u2014 required to understand the pointed-to object type and any const/volatile qualifications that affect whether the pointer or the pointed object is considered modifiable. 3) POSIX_GlobalVars (global variable / struct/typedef definition) \u2014 the code takes the address of a member of this global; we need its definition to confirm NormalSigMask is an object (not a macro or function) and to see any qualifiers on the global or its type. 4) POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (member declaration and its type/qualifiers) \u2014 needed to verify the exact member type and qualifiers (e.g. whether it is declared const) so we can determine what is being passed to sigsuspend and whether any pointer parameter or pointed object is being modified. Together these symbols let the analyzer determine whether any function parameter of OS_IdleLoop_Impl is modified (there are none) and whether the pointer parameter passed to sigsuspend is consistent with MISRA constraints (pointer constness and whether the object pointed-to may be changed)."
