  "explanation": "No function parameters are declared in OS_IdleLoop_Impl (signature: void OS_IdleLoop_Impl(void)), so there are no parameters that could be modified within this function. The only notable statement is the call sigsuspend(&POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask); which passes the address of a global sigset object. This does not modify any parameter of OS_IdleLoop_Impl. Moreover, the POSIX prototype for sigsuspend takes a const sigset_t * (i.e. sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask)), so the callee is not expected to modify the pointed-to object via the pointer, and any modification of a pointer parameter inside a callee would be local to that function (the pointer is passed by value). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
