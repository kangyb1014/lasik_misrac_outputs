The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "sigsuspend: The target function's only statement is a call to sigsuspend. To determine whether the target violates the MISRA for-loop rule we must inspect any functions called by the target (the rule counts the behaviour of callees as part of a loop body). We need the declaration/definition of sigsuspend to see if it contains for\u2011loops, modifies external objects (possible loop counters), or has persistent side effects relevant to the rule.\n\nPOSIX_GlobalVars: The global object containing NormalSigMask. Its definition (type, qualifiers, and any accessor macros) is required to determine whether reading its address or its members has side effects or aliasing that could invalidate the for\u2011loop clause restrictions.\n\nPOSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: The exact variable passed to sigsuspend. We need its declaration/type and any macros/inline functions that reference it to verify whether it is modified elsewhere or has semantics (volatile, macros with side effects) that would affect the allowed expressions in for\u2011loop clauses.\n\nsigset_t: The type of NormalSigMask (or the underlying type). Knowing the type is necessary to see if taking its address or operations on it involve hidden side effects or non\u2011scalar behaviour that could interact with loop counter rules.\n\nOS_IdleLoop: The direct caller of OS_IdleLoop_Impl. Because MISRA's rule treats the behaviour of functions called inside a for loop as part of the for\u2011loop body, we must inspect call sites (and callers) to see whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl is invoked from within any for loops (or could be inlined) and whether the caller's loops use loop counters or flags that could be modified by OS_IdleLoop_Impl or by sigsuspend/NormalSigMask."
