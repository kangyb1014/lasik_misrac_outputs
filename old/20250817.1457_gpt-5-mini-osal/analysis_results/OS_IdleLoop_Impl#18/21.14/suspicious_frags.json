  "explanation": "I inspected the provided OS_IdleLoop_Impl function and the related symbol definition. The function contains only a call to sigsuspend(&POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask) and the global POSIX_GlobalVars is initialized with = {0}. There are no uses of memcmp (or any other Standard Library string-comparison functions) in the supplied code fragments, nor any apparent indirect calls or macros that invoke memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
