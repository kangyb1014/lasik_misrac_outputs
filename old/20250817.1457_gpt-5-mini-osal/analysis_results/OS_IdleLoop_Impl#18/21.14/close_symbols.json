  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl violates the MISRA rule forbidding memcmp for null-terminated string comparison we need the few symbols that appear syntactically in the function and any definitions/macros that could expand into code that uses memcmp:\n\n- sigsuspend: The function call in the body. We must inspect its declaration/definition or any project wrapper/macro that could expand into project code that calls memcmp. If sigsuspend is only a standard library call, its internal use of memcmp (if any) is outside the project's source and not a direct MISRA violation by this module; but if sigsuspend is a project-level wrapper or macro, that wrapper could contain memcmp usage.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: The global variable whose member is passed to sigsuspend. We need its definition to see whether access involves any hidden operations (e.g., overloaded macros, accessor functions) that could call memcmp.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask: The specific member used. Knowing its type and definition ensures the expression &POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask is a plain address-of a sigset_t and not a macro or function-like expansion that could perform string comparisons using memcmp.\n\n- sigset_t: The type of NormalSigMask. Confirming it is the expected signal-set type (not some project typedef that maps to a struct with string fields or custom accessors) rules out accidental string comparisons.\n\n- signal.h (declaration/possible macro for sigsuspend): The header-level declaration or macros for sigsuspend (or any project header that redefines it) must be checked to ensure sigsuspend is not #defined to some inline/project function that uses memcmp.\n\nNo other symbols are required because the target function contains a single call and a single global reference; there are no local string operations or direct calls to memcmp in the shown code or its static callees (none). The above symbols let an analyst confirm whether any code expanded or invoked by this function could perform forbidden memcmp-based string comparisons."
