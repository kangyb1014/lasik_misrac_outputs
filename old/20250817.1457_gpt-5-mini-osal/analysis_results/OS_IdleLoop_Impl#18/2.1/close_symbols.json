  "explanation": "- OS_IdleLoop: The target is called from OS_IdleLoop per the call graph. You must inspect OS_IdleLoop implementation to see whether the call to OS_IdleLoop_Impl is present, conditional, or inside unreachable code paths (loops, early returns, #if blocks). This determines reachability of OS_IdleLoop_Impl.\n- OS_Application_Run: OS_IdleLoop is called by OS_Application_Run. To prove reachability of OS_IdleLoop_Impl you need the call chain and control flow in OS_Application_Run (is the call to OS_IdleLoop executed, conditional, or in dead code?).\n- main (or other program entrypoint, e.g. _start): The MISRA unreachable-code check must relate to program entrypoints. You need to know whether OS_Application_Run (and thus OS_IdleLoop/OS_IdleLoop_Impl) is reachable from the program entrypoint(s). Provide the startup/main routine(s) that invoke OS_Application_Run or its wrappers.\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler: OS_IdleLoop lists UT_ExecuteBasicHandler as a callee. Its behavior or placement in OS_IdleLoop may affect control flow (loops, long blocking calls, conditional flows) that determine whether OS_IdleLoop_Impl is ever reached.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars (definition/decl and its NormalSigMask member): The target references POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask. Include its declaration/type to ensure the reference is well-formed and to detect any preprocessor or linker conditions that could remove or alter the symbol (which could affect whether the function is considered live or optimized away).\n- sigsuspend (prototype/definition): The call to sigsuspend is the sole statement in OS_IdleLoop_Impl. You need the prototype/attributes (e.g., noreturn annotations, macros) to understand whether control flow returns or not (affects reachability analysis of subsequent code) and whether the call expands to something unexpected via macro.\n- Preprocessor condition macros that guard compilation of OS_IdleLoop_Impl / OS_IdleLoop / OS_Application_Run: Conditional compilation can make code unreachable by excluding callers or callees. Include the relevant #if/#ifdef symbols so the analyzer can determine which variants/builds actually contain the call chain.\n\nProvide these symbol definitions/implementations (source or headers) so the next agent can fully determine if OS_IdleLoop_Impl is part of any reachable execution path or if it (or surrounding code) is unreachable per MISRA."
