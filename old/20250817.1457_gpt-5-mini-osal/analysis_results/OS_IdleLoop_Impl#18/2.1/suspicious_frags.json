  "explanation": "I flagged the idle loop and the sigsuspend call because these are the control-flow locations where execution may block indefinitely (sigsuspend) or loop forever (the while loop calling OS_IdleLoop_Impl). Such constructs can make subsequent code effectively unreachable at runtime and therefore warrant inspection for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n\nOther fragments in the provided snippets do not appear to contain unreachable code patterns: the UT_ExecuteBasicHandler function contains conditional logic with no obviously constant true/false conditions or code after unconditional returns; UT_DefaultStubImpl is called unconditionally (and so is reachable); there are no apparent dead branches, unreachable statements after return, or compile-time constant conditions in the rest of the supplied code. No other functions or blocks in the provided excerpts statically show unreachable code, so they do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 based on the supplied context."
