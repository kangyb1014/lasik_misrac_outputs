  "explanation": "- sigsuspend (function prototype): Determine whether sigsuspend is declared in the TU or being called implicitly. An implicit-function declaration or a nonstandard prototype could indicate use of a language-extension/legacy feature. Also the prototype may carry compiler-specific attributes that are extensions.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars (object/declaration): The symbol\u2019s declaration/definition can contain nonstandard storage-class specifiers, attributes, or compiler extensions. We must inspect it to see whether the code relies on any extension in the variable declaration.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.NormalSigMask (member): The member\u2019s presence and type must be confirmed; its declaration might be a macro or use nonstandard constructs (bitfields, anonymous unions/structs) that are language extensions.\n- sigset_t (typedef/definition): The type of NormalSigMask; its definition may be implementation-specific or use compiler extensions (platform typedefs or macros). Knowing the exact type is necessary to see if &NormalSigMask yields a standard pointer type accepted by standard C.\n- translation-unit headers and feature-test macros (e.g. inclusion of <signal.h>, _POSIX_C_SOURCE, _GNU_SOURCE): Feature-test macros and the set of included headers control whether nonstandard APIs or extensions are exposed. They must be known to determine if any extended language/ABI features are in effect.\n- any compiler-specific attributes or calling-convention annotations applied to the above (e.g. __attribute__, __cdecl, __stdcall): Attributes on functions/objects are compiler language extensions; their presence on sigsuspend, POSIX_GlobalVars, or related declarations would be a MISRA-relevant language extension.\n\nThese symbols and declarations are the minimal set required to decide if the single-line implementation of OS_IdleLoop_Impl relies on or invokes any compiler/language extensions (implicit declarations, nonstandard attributes, nonstandard types, or feature-test macros enabling extensions)."
