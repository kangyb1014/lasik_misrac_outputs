  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function and its symbols use only standard C constructs: typedef aliases for fixed-width integer types (int32_t, uint32_t), a forward declaration typedef for a struct (typedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t), ordinary local variable declarations, function calls, and standard comments. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, zero-length arrays, anonymous structs/unions with compiler-specific syntax, or nonstandard lexical tokens. Declaring a typedef name for a struct (an incomplete type) is standard C; instantiating the variable token requires the complete definition to be visible at the point of compilation, but that is a correctness/visibility issue, not a language-extension usage. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
