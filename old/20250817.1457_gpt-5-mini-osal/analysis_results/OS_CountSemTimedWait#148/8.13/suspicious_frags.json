  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 8.13 concerns use of pointer-to-const where possible. In this function the only pointer usage is the address of the local token variable passed to two functions; therefore those sites are the relevant fragments to investigate (and the token declaration itself to see if it could be const-qualified). Other code in this function does not involve pointers: sem_id and msecs are passed by value, return_code is a scalar, and no other address-of or pointer-type expressions appear. Hence no other fragments need to be investigated for this rule."
