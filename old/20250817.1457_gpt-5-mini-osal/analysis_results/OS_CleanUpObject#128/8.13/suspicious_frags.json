  "explanation": "Only fragments that involve pointer types or pointer casts are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). The listed fragments cover the function parameter (void *arg), the pointer variable (uint32 *ObjectCount), the explicit cast from void* to uint32* and the dereference/modification of that pointer. Other code fragments (the switch statement, the case labels and the calls such as OS_TaskDelete(object_id), OS_QueueDelete(object_id), etc.) either do not involve pointers to object data in this function, operate on object identifiers passed by value (osal_id_t) rather than pointers, or are simple control-flow constructs; therefore they are not relevant to checking const-qualification of pointer targets for Rule 8.13 and do not need investigation in this context."
