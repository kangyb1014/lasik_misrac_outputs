Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_CleanUpObject.\n```c\nvoid OS_CleanUpObject(osal_id_t object_id, void *arg)\n{\n    uint32 *ObjectCount;\n\n    ObjectCount = (uint32 *)arg;\n    ++(*ObjectCount);\n    switch (OS_IdentifyObject(object_id))\n    {\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK:\n            OS_TaskDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_QUEUE:\n            OS_QueueDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_BINSEM:\n            OS_BinSemDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_COUNTSEM:\n            OS_CountSemDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MUTEX:\n            OS_MutSemDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE:\n            OS_ModuleUnload(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE:\n            OS_TimeBaseDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB:\n            OS_TimerDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_STREAM:\n            OS_close(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_DIR:\n            OS_DirectoryClose(object_id);\n            break;\n        case OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR:\n            OS_CondVarDelete(object_id);\n            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The OS_DEBUG call in the error branch of OS_TaskDelete_Impl (the pthread_join failure path) performs only logging (side-effect-free w.r.t. program state/behavior). It is executed when pthread_join returns an error, but removing this debug print would not change return codes, object state, or control flow. Therefore this operation constitutes dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (unless OS_DEBUG has required side-effects in this build configuration).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_CleanUpObject_Probe(const char *stage, osal_id_t object_id, uint32 count, int objtype)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1026.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        time_t t = time(NULL);\n        fprintf(f, \"%ld: %s -

  "explanation": "The report is not correct as stated. MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. To claim a violation you must show that the operation (here the OS_DEBUG call) is both executed at run time and that its removal would not affect any aspect of program behaviour. Agent A\u2019s argument is speculative: it assumes OS_DEBUG has no observable side-effects (no output, no timing effect, no interaction with external observers), but no evidence is provided for that. In general a logging/diagnostic call produces an externally observable effect (a message, a file, console output, or even timing changes) and therefore its removal can change program behaviour. Also whether a statement is \u201cdead\u201d is a project-level property (depends on build configuration/macros). The probe test did not exercise the function (empty log), so it does not demonstrate the call is executed and inert. To demonstrate a true Rule 2.2 violation you must show (1) the code is executed in the project\u2019s build/runtime, (2) the OS_DEBUG expansion is a no-op in that build (or produces no observable effect and does not affect timing), and (3) removal does not change any externally observable behaviour. Without that evidence the report is not justified."
