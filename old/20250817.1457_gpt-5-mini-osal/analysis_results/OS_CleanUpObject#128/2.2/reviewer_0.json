  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour (i.e. proven dead code). The claim rests on the assumption that the default: break; is actually executed and is redundant. From the code alone there is no evidence that the default label is reachable (OS_IdentifyObject may never return an out\u2011of\u2011set value) \u2014 if it is unreachable it is not dead code (Note 2). Even if the default is reachable, the presence of an explicit default is a legitimate defensive measure (and removal could in some builds change timing or diagnostic behaviour), so you cannot conclude the statement is dead without a project\u2011level analysis showing the operation is executed and provably removable without effect. The provided test run produced no evidence that the default branch was taken. Therefore the report of a Rule 2.2 violation is not supported."
