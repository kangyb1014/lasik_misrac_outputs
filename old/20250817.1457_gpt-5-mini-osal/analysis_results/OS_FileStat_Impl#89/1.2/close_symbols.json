  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function uses compiler/language extensions (MISRA: 'Language extensions should not be used') the analyzer needs the concrete definitions and feature-test context for all platform and OS-specific symbols used by the function:\n\n- struct stat (from <sys/stat.h>): required to check which members are standard vs implementation extensions and whether field names used by the code are non\u2011standard.  \n- struct timespec (from <time.h>): required to verify tv_sec/tv_nsec are standard members and types (not compiler extensions).  \n- st_mtim (struct stat member) and st_mtime: st_mtim (POSIX.1-2008) availability can be controlled by feature-test macros; must be checked to determine if accessing st_mtim is relying on a non\u2011standard extension on the target platform.  \n- stat (function prototype): to confirm use of stat() and its semantics are standard POSIX and not a compiler-specific variant.  \n- _POSIX_C_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE (feature-test macros): these determine which struct stat members and related APIs are exposed by the headers; needed to judge whether code is using a conditional extension or only standard facilities.  \n- S_ISDIR and the S_I* / S_IX* macros: these macros come from <sys/stat.h>; the analyzer must confirm they are standard POSIX macros and not custom/extension macros on the target toolchain.  \n- mode_t, off_t, time_t typedefs: to verify the types used (st_mode, st_size, tv_sec) are standard types and not compiler-specific typedefs or extensions.  \n- os_fstat_t and its members (FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits): to ensure these application-level types/macros do not themselves use compiler extensions (e.g., nonstandard attributes, bit-field extensions, or compiler-specific type qualifiers).  \n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds (prototype): to check this helper does not use language extensions in its signature or expected types (affects whether its use here constitutes using an extension).  \n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: these implementation constants/macros may be defined via compiler-specific constructs; need their definitions to judge extension usage.  \n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_* (bitmask macros) and OS_SUCCESS / OS_ERROR: to verify they are ordinary constants/macros/enums and do not hide compiler extensions (attributes, pragmas, or nonstandard qualifiers).\n\nProviding these symbol definitions (or the headers and implementation fragments that define them) lets the next agent determine whether any identifiers or member accesses in OS_FileStat_Impl rely on non\u2011standard / compiler-specific language extensions rather than standard C/POSIX facilities."
