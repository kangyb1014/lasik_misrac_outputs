  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-language extensions in this function. The code only uses standard C and POSIX interfaces: stat(), struct stat, struct timespec, mode_t, S_ISDIR and the S_I* permission macros, and preprocessor feature-test checks (_POSIX_C_SOURCE/_XOPEN_SOURCE) to select between st_mtim and st_mtime. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs (no __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof/__typeof__, statement expressions, anonymous structs/unions as extensions, or other vendor-specific extensions). The conditional use of st.st_mtim is guarded by standard feature-test macros, so it is not an unguarded compiler extension. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
