  "explanation": "For assessing MISRA's 'for loop shall be well-formed' rule you must know any symbols that could participate in loop control, be modified in a loop body, or cause side effects via functions called from the body. Explanations: \n\n- stat: system/library call used here; its semantics and side effects must be known (it may modify the provided struct and could call library code with side effects). Necessary to determine whether calling it from a for-body would violate the rule. \n- struct stat (definition: st_size, st_mode, st_uid, st_gid, st_mtim/st_mtime): the members accessed by the function are examined to see which objects are modified locally vs externally; also needed to know if any member aliases global state or has non-obvious side effects. \n- struct timespec (tv_sec, tv_nsec): used to assemble FileTime; inspect types to ensure no hidden modifications of loop counters/flags. \n- os_fstat_t (FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits): the target writes these members; needed to know whether they are distinct local objects or alias global/extern objects (which would affect the rule about modified objects). \n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: called from the target; per MISRA the behavior of called functions in the loop body must be known (side effects, modification of objects, global state). Must inspect its implementation/signature. \n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID / OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: used in comparisons; must know if these are compile-time constants, macros, or variables (if variables they could be modified elsewhere or even in called functions, affecting loop control rules). \n- S_ISDIR: macro used to test st_mode; its expansion must be checked to ensure it has no side effects if used in a for clause. \n- S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP: permission macros/constants used to build bitmasks; needed to confirm they are compile-time constants (no side effects) and to reason about which objects are being tested/modified. \n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_READ, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_WRITE, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_EXEC: flags written into FileStats->FileModeBits; must know whether these are simple constants and whether FileModeBits is a local field or aliases externally-visible object. \n- OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: return-code constants used by the function; include for completeness to determine if return-related logic could interact with loop control or be used in for-clause expressions.\n\nIn summary, to decide whether this function violates the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule you must examine any called functions (stat, OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds) for side effects, and confirm that all identifiers used in control/tests/assignments (the file-mode flags, OS_IMPL_SELF_* values, and FileStats members) are simple objects/constants or whether they could be modified elsewhere (which could create loop-control side effects). These symbols are the minimal set required to perform that analysis."
