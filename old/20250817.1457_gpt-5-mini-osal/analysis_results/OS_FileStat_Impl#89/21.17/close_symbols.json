  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule about prohibited out\u2011of\u2011bounds use of <string.h> functions we must inspect any symbols that could themselves call or expand to code that uses string functions or that could hide pointer/array writes. Brief reasons:\n\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: the only direct callee; its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not call any <string.h> functions (memcpy/strcpy/etc.) or otherwise perform unsafe pointer/array accesses.\n\n- os_fstat_t: the FileStats type and its field types must be known to ensure assignments (FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits) do not write into character buffers or otherwise cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses (e.g., if any field were an array or pointer).\n\n- struct stat and struct timespec: their definitions (including st_size, st_mode, st_uid, st_gid, st_mtim/st_mtime, tv_sec/tv_nsec) are needed to confirm types (integers vs. pointers/arrays) so the code's member reads/writes cannot violate string bounds rules.\n\n- stat: the POSIX stat function is invoked with local_path; inspect whether local_path handling in the build (library wrapper) could use string.h functions in a way relevant to MISRA checking (usually system call/library code is out of scope, but include to be explicit).\n\n- S_ISDIR and the S_I* macros (S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP): these macros must be checked to ensure they are simple bitmask macros and do not expand to function calls or macros that internally use string functions or perform pointer arithmetic.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: these identifiers may be macros or expressions (could call getuid()/getegid() wrappers); include to confirm they do not expand into constructs that use string functions or perform pointer writes.\n\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_READ, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_WRITE, OS_FILESTAT_MODE_EXEC: these flags should be checked to ensure they are simple integer constants/bitmasks and not complex macros/functions with side effects that could call string functions.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR: return-code macros/constants \u2014 include to ensure they are simple constants and not macros that could hide string operations.\n\nIn short: include the direct callee (OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds), the types/structs and macros referenced by the function (to validate they do not hide string.h usage or pointer/array writes), and the stat/standard types to confirm member types. With these symbols defined, one can determine whether any string.h functions are used directly or indirectly and whether any pointer/array bounds accesses occur."
