  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The function parameters and pointer usages are as follows:\n\n- local_path is declared as const char * (already const-qualified), satisfying the rule.\n- FileStats is declared as os_fstat_t * and is intentionally non-const because the function writes output into this structure (modifying the pointee is required behavior), so it must not be const.\n- The address-of operator (&st) is used to pass a pointer to a local struct stat to the stat() API; stat() requires a non-const struct stat * to populate file information, so this usage is appropriate.\n- filetime and st are local struct objects copied by value (filetime = st.st_mtim), not pointers, so Rule 8.13 does not apply.\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds takes integer arguments and returns a struct by value; no pointers are involved.\n\nTherefore, there are no pointer declarations or usages in this code that could be changed to point to const-qualified types without preventing required modifications or violating API contracts; no fragments need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
