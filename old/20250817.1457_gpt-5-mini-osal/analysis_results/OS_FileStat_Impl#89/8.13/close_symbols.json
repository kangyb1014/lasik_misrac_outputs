  "explanation": "1) stat \u2014 Need the function prototype (int stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf)) to confirm the constness of the first parameter and the mutability of the second. MISRA analysis must verify that local_path is passed to a function expecting a const pointer and that the &st argument requires a non-const struct stat* (so non-const is justified).\n\n2) struct stat \u2014 The full definition is required to check whether any members of struct stat are pointer types (or contain pointer subobjects). The rule applies if the code takes or passes pointers to members; for example, the code reads st.st_mtim / st.st_mtime \u2014 you must confirm these are non-pointer scalars/structs so no missing const qualification on pointers is present.\n\n3) struct timespec \u2014 The code constructs/reads a struct timespec (tv_sec, tv_nsec). The timespec definition is needed to ensure its members are scalar types (not pointers) and to verify OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds usage does not require passing pointer(s) that should be const-qualified.\n\n4) os_fstat_t \u2014 The typedef/struct definition for the FileStats parameter is necessary to determine whether any of FileStats\u2019 members are pointer types (and thus whether the non-const os_fstat_t *FileStats parameter should have been const-qualified). Also used to confirm which members are written (FileSize, FileTime, FileModeBits) and whether those are pointer or scalar types.\n\n5) OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds \u2014 Prototype is required to confirm its parameter and return types (does it take or return pointer types?). If it accepted pointer arguments or returned a pointer, the constness rules could be affected; with the prototype you can verify no pointer constness issues are introduced.\n\n6) _POSIX_C_SOURCE and 7) _XOPEN_SOURCE \u2014 These feature-test macros determine which struct stat members are available (st_mtim vs st_mtime). The analysis must consider both conditional branches: whether st.st_mtim (a struct timespec) exists or the fallback st.st_mtime (time_t) is used. Knowing the macros (or their configured values) is necessary to decide which member is actually referenced and whether any pointer types are involved."
