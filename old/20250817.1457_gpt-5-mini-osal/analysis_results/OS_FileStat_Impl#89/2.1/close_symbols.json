  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in OS_FileStat_Impl is unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code), the analyzer needs the compile-time and type/macro information that can make branches or whole blocks impossible to compile or execute:\n\n- struct stat: The function reads multiple fields (st_size, st_mode, st_uid, st_gid) and conditionally uses st.st_mtim or st.st_mtime. The presence/shape of st_mtim vs st_mtime and their types determine which #if/#else branch is actually valid/available and whether related code is unreachable.\n\n- struct timespec: The filetime variable uses tv_sec/tv_nsec. The struct definition is needed to know types and member names used in the chosen compile-time branch.\n\n- _POSIX_C_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE: These feature-test macros control the conditional compilation (#if) that selects use of st.st_mtim (POSIX.1-2008) vs the fallback. Their values decide at compile-time which branch exists; the other branch would be unreachable/absent.\n\n- stat (function or macro): The early return if (stat(...) < 0) makes the remainder conditionally reachable at runtime. Also some environments may #define stat to a wrapper (or to OS_stat) changing semantics; knowing the actual symbol is needed to judge reachability semantics.\n\n- S_ISDIR: Determines whether the directory-handling branch can be true. Its macro definition (how it tests st_mode) is required to assess if that branch can ever be taken for given st_mode values.\n\n- Permission bit macros (S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP): These macros are used to compute readbits/writebits/execbits and to test st.st_mode. If any of these macros are defined as constant-zero or otherwise, certain tests or OR operations could become no-ops and render code effectively unreachable.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID and OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: The two if-statements compare these symbols against st.st_uid/st.st_gid. If these are compile-time constants that cannot equal any st.* value, the corresponding branches would be unreachable; conversely if they are expressions (e.g., call to geteuid()) they are not compile-time constants. Their definitions are therefore required to decide reachability.\n\n- os_fstat_t (definition): To reason about the comment that \"fst_mode\" (FileModeBits) is zeroed by caller and the effect of subsequent bitwise ORs, the actual structure and initial state of FileModeBits must be known. This affects whether some assignments are redundant/unreachable.\n\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_* flags: The specific flag definitions are needed to know if ORing them into FileModeBits has any effect (e.g., if they are zero or aliases) and whether the write/read/exec/dir-setting code is meaningful or unreachable.\n\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: The call exists in the function; while it does not affect intra-function branching, its prototype/definition may reveal side effects or compile-time attributes that could affect reachability analysis (e.g., if it is a macro that removes the call). Including it completes the symbol set for a precise analysis."
