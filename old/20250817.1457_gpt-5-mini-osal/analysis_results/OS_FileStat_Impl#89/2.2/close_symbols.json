  "explanation": "To judge whether any operation in OS_FileStat_Impl is \"dead\" (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour) the analyzer must know the precise definitions and values that affect control flow, assignments and observable outputs:\n\n- struct stat: The function reads st_size, st_mode, st_mtim/st_mtime, st_uid and st_gid. Whether branches and assignments are meaningful depends on which members exist, their types and semantics (e.g. st_mtim vs st_mtime availability).\n\n- struct timespec: The code assembles a timespec and uses its tv_sec/tv_nsec in the call to OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds; their types/semantics matter to know whether that call is a no-op or has observable effect.\n\n- _POSIX_C_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE: These preprocessor macros select the st_mtim vs st_mtime path. If one path is impossible in the build, the other branch is dead and must be identified.\n\n- S_ISDIR: The directory test determines whether OS_FILESTAT_MODE_DIR is set. Its implementation (how it uses st_mode) affects whether the conditional can be folded away.\n\n- Permission bitmasks (S_I*): The code composes readbits/writebits/execbits and tests st.st_mode & bits. Exact bit values and overlaps determine whether the OR/branching and subsequent bit tests are meaningful or redundant.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID / OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: These global constants control the two ownership branches. If they have fixed values that make the comparisons always true or always false in the build, those branches may be dead.\n\n- os_fstat_t and caller initialization: The function writes into FileStats->FileSize/FileTime/FileModeBits. Whether writes to FileModeBits are redundant depends on FileModeBits initial value and whether the caller (e.g., OS_stat) zeroes it beforehand; thus the struct layout and the caller behaviour must be known to determine if assignments are redundant.\n\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: Return codes are observable outputs; removal of return paths or the early return on stat failure would alter behaviour. Knowing their values/usage helps judge removability.\n\n- OS_FILESTAT_MODE_* constants: These define which bits are set in FileModeBits. If they overlap or are zero, writes could be no-ops; their definitions are necessary to decide that.\n\n- OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds: The function is invoked with filetime values. To know whether that call (and the computed FileTime assignment) is necessary or has side effects, its prototype/semantics must be known (e.g. pure computation vs global-state side-effect).\n\n- stat() and errno behaviour: The early return depends on stat() result. Knowing stat() contract (when it returns <0 and whether it modifies 'st' or errno) is required to know if the early-return path is reachable/meaningful.\n\n- OS_stat (caller): The static call graph shows OS_stat calls OS_FileStat_Impl; the caller might pre-initialize or interpret outputs in such a way that some writes here are redundant \u2014 the caller must be examined to decide deadness of operations in this function.\n\n- int32, mode_t, time_t typedefs: Knowing signedness/ranges can affect whether comparisons and bit-ops are meaningful (e.g. sign-extended masks) and therefore whether some operations are effectively no-ops.\n\nCollectively, these symbols give the necessary semantic context (data layout, constant values, build-time feature selection, caller behaviour and called-function semantics) to determine if any statement in OS_FileStat_Impl is executed but removable without changing observable program behaviour (i.e. dead code under MISRA C)."
