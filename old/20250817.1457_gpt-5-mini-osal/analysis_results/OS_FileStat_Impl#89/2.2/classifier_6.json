  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code.

The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileStat_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileStat_Impl(const char *local_path, os_fstat_t *FileStats)\n{\n    struct stat     st;\n    mode_t          readbits;\n    mode_t          writebits;\n    mode_t          execbits;\n    struct timespec filetime;\n\n    if (stat(local_path, &st) < 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    FileStats->FileSize = st.st_size;\n\n    /*\n     * NOTE: Traditional timestamps are only a whole number of seconds (time_t)\n     * POSIX.1-2008 expands this to have a full \"struct timespec\" with nanosecond\n     * resolution.\n     *\n     * GLIBC (and likely other C libraries that use similar feature selection)\n     * will expose this value based on _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE minimum\n     * values.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The group-bit OR operations modify local variables (readbits/writebits/execbits) that are later used to set FileStats->FileModeBits; removing them would change behavior when the process effective group matches the file group. The condition is evaluated at run time (depends on st.st_gid) so the code is not dead. (A violation would only occur if the body were executed but its effects were never observed \u2014 which is not the case here.)"
