  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments were not reported because they perform observable operations that clearly affect program behaviour and thus are unlikely to be dead code. In particular: the stat(local_path, &st) call and its error check determine whether the function proceeds; FileStats->FileTime is computed from filetime and passed through OS_TimeAssembleFromNanoseconds (an externally visible effect); the local variables are assigned and consumed by subsequent logic; and the function returns OS_ERROR or OS_SUCCESS which obviously affect control flow. The listed fragments were chosen because they contain assignments/conditional branches whose effect could be redundant (for example, conditional augmentation of permission bitmasks, the POSIX-resolution conditional code paths, and the FileSize assignment) and therefore merit further investigation to confirm they are not executed needlessly or have no effect on observable behaviour."
