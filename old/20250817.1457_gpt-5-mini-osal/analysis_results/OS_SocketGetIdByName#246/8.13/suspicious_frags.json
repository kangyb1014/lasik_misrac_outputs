  "explanation": "Only the listed fragments involve pointer types or pointer use relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The remaining lines in the function (e.g. the local variable declaration 'int32 return_code;' and the 'return return_code;' statement) do not declare or pass pointers and therefore cannot violate the requirement that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever possible. No other pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions appear in the provided code, so no additional fragments need investigation for this rule."
