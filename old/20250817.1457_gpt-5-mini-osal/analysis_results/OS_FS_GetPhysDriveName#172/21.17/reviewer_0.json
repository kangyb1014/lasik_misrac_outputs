If a caller passes a smaller buffer (e.g. char buf[16]; OS_FS_GetPhysDriveName(buf, ...)), the strncpy will write up to 63 bytes and the subsequent write of index 63 will overflow buf. Also, strncpy may read up to OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN-1 bytes from filesys->system_mountpt; if filesys->system_mountpt's array size or termination is smaller than that, this can read beyond its bounds. Therefore Rule 21.17 is violated.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_FS_LogProbe(const char *stage,\n                           const void *phys_ptr,\n                           const void *mount_ptr,\n                           const void *filesys_ptr,\n                           int32_t return_code,\n                           unsigned long flags,\n                           size_t planned_copy_len)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1383.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging cannot be performed, do not alter program flow. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    time_t t = time(NULL);\n    fprintf(f, \"[%ld] STAGE=%s\\n\", (long)t, stage);\n    fprintf(f, \"  PhysDriveName_ptr=%p\\n\", phys_ptr);\n    fprintf(f, \"  MountPoint_ptr=%p\\n\", mount_ptr);\n    fprintf(f, \"  filesys_ptr=%p\\n\", filesys_ptr);\n    fprintf(f, \"  return_code=%d\\n\", (int)return_code);\n    fprintf(f, \"  filesys_flags=0x%lx\\n\", flags);\n    fprintf(f, \"  planned_copy_length=%zu\\n\", planned_copy_len);\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_FS_GetPhysDriveName(char *PhysDriveName, const char *MountPoint)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t             token;\n    int32                         return_code;\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_PATHNAME(MountPoint);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(PhysDriveName);\n\n    /* Log entry with pointer information before doing the object lookup. */\n    OS_FS_LogProbe(\"entry\", (void *)PhysDriveName, (void *)MountPoint, NULL, -1, 0, (size_t)OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN - 1);\n\n    /* Get a reference lock, as a filesystem check could take some time. */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint,\n                                         (void *)MountPoint, &token);\n\n    /* Log result of lookup attempt */\n    OS_FS_LogProbe(\"after_lookup\", (void *)PhysDriveName, (void *)MountPoint, NULL, return_code, 0, (size_t)OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN - 1);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, token);\n\n        /* Log the filesys pointer and flags before checking mount state */\n        OS_FS_LogProbe(\"before_state_check\", (void *)PhysDriveName, (void *)MountPoint, (void *)filesys, return_code,\n                       (unsigned long)filesys->flags, (size_t)OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN - 1);\n\n        if ((filesys->flags & OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_SYSTEM) != 0)\n        {\n            /* Log intent to copy: we do not read the contents of the source here to avoid\n             * introducing any additional out-of-bounds reads.

  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is correct. The code calls strncpy(PhysDriveName, filesys->system_mountpt, OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN - 1) and then writes PhysDriveName[OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN - 1] = 0, but the function performs only a null-pointer check (OS_CHECK_POINTER) and does not verify that the caller-supplied PhysDriveName actually points to an object at least OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN bytes long. As written, a caller could pass a smaller buffer and the strncpy + explicit terminator write can write beyond the destination object\u2019s bounds, which is exactly the situation Rule 21.17 forbids. Similarly, unless it is provable from the surrounding code that filesys->system_mountpt is at least OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN-1 bytes long, the strncpy may also read beyond the source object\u2019s bounds. If there is an external, enforceable contract/documentation that guarantees the caller always provides a buffer of size OS_FS_PHYS_NAME_LEN and that filesys->system_mountpt is sufficiently large, then the implementation would be acceptable; however, based on the code shown (no length validation or documented enforcement visible), the reported violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 stands.\n\nSuggested fixes: accept a destination-size parameter and use a bounds-limited copy (or check the passed pointer refers to an adequately sized object), or use a safer API that requires/uses the size to avoid out-of-bounds access."
