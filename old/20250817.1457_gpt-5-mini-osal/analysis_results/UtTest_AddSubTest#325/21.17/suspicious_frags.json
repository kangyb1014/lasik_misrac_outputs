  "explanation": "The rest of the code consists of declarations, simple pointer assignments (GroupPtr = GroupName; TestPtr = TestName;), comments, and the final UtTest_AddCommon call; these lines do not invoke functions from <string.h> and do not themselves perform unbounded memory accesses that relate to Rule 21.17. The declared buffer CompleteTestName has an explicit size (128) and the snprintf call uses sizeof(CompleteTestName) to limit written bytes (snprintf is still included above for investigation because it reads the input strings). No other string.h functions (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strcat, strlen, etc.) are present in the fragment, so no additional lines need inspection under Rule 21.17."
