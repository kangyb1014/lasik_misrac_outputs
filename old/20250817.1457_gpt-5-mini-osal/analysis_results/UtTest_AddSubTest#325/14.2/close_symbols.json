The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- UtTest_AddCommon: Direct callee of UtTest_AddSubTest. Any for-loops inside UtTest_AddCommon (or the way it uses loop counters/flags) are relevant because the MISRA rule requires inspecting loop bodies and any functions they call. You must examine UtTest_AddCommon's implementation to see whether it contains for-loops and whether those loops are well-formed and not affected by called functions.\n- UT_BSP_Lock: Indirect callee (called by UtTest_AddCommon). If UtTest_AddCommon contains for-loops that call UT_BSP_Lock inside their body (or if UT_BSP_Lock modifies globals used as loop counters/control flags), UT_BSP_Lock's behaviour is relevant to determine compliance. Provide its implementation/semantics to check for side effects on loop counters or flags.\n- UtList_Add: Indirect callee (called by UtTest_AddCommon). It may contain internal loops or modify objects (e.g., list pointers or counters) that could be used as loop counters/control flags by callers. Its implementation must be inspected for for-loops and for side effects that would violate the rule.\n- UT_BSP_Unlock: Indirect callee (called by UtTest_AddCommon). Same rationale as UT_BSP_Lock: its side effects (if invoked inside loop bodies) could affect loop counters or control flags; include it to verify no forbidden modifications.\n- UTASSERT_GROUP_TEST: Constant/macro passed into UtTest_AddCommon. Include its definition because if it expands to an expression with side effects (unlikely but possible in macros), it could affect the well-formedness of any for-loop expressions where it is used.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no for-loops, but MISRA\u2019s wording requires examining the behaviour of functions called within loop bodies. The listed symbols cover the direct callee and its direct callees (per the static call graph) and the macro argument that could influence expressions; these are the minimal additional symbols needed to determine whether any relevant for-loops (in callees) are well-formed and free of prohibited side effects."
