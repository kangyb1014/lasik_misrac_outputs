  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment calls OS_DEBUG with a constant format string and two unsigned integer arguments (casts of token->obj_type and token->lock_mode). There is no use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc.) or string pointer parameters in this call, so no risk of out\u2011of\u2011bounds access as described by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (If OS_DEBUG\u2019s hidden implementation were to misuse <string.h> functions internally that could cause an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access, that would be a separate issue, but nothing in this fragment itself violates Rule 21.17.)"
