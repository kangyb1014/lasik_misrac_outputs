  "explanation": "No direct uses of any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided OS_Unlock_Global implementation or the related type definitions. The function body consists of integer/enum comparisons, bitmasking operations, structure field assignments, and calls to other functions. The simple assignments and comparisons (e.g. objtype->owner_key = OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID; token->lock_key = OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID; the key_value mask/comparison) do not involve string handling and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 21.17. Note: the calls to external routines (OS_Unlock_Global_Impl and OS_DEBUG) are outside the provided code; their implementations should be checked separately for any use of the restricted string.h functions, but those implementations are not part of the supplied fragment and thus are not considered direct violations within this function."
