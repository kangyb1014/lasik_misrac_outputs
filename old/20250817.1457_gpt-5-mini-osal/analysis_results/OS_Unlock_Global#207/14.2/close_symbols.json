  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why it is needed to determine compliance with the MISRA for\u2011loop rule):\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - The function parameter type; needed to see the exact structure of token (fields obj_type, lock_mode, lock_key) to determine whether any for loops could be introduced implicitly (e.g., via macros accessing these fields) or whether token fields are loop counters/flags in any macros.\n\n- OS_objtype_state_t\n  - The element type of OS_objtype_state. Required to inspect the owner_key field (and any functions/macros operating on objtype) to discover any for loops or side effects in those operations.\n\n- OS_objtype_state\n  - The global array referenced by index token->obj_type; its definition may include initializers or accessor macros that contain for loops, and its layout is needed to understand how owner_key is accessed and modified.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER\n  - The constant used in the if-condition. Knowing its value/definition can reveal whether the conditional expands to macros or expressions that contain loops or affect control flow relevant to loop analysis.\n\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE\n  - The lock-mode constant used in the if-condition; its definition may be a macro or expression that could contain constructs relevant to loop analysis.\n\n- (type of) owner_key/lock_key (structure with key_value field)\n  - The concrete struct type (and key_value field type) is required to understand assignments and bitwise tests on key_value, and to check whether any operator overloads/macros or hidden side effects exist (e.g., accessor macros that include loops). Also needed to see if these fields could be considered loop counters or control flags in any for loops.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE\n  - The constant used in the key comparison. Its definition might be a macro expression that could include loops or side effects; include it to rule that out.\n\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID\n  - Assigned to owner_key and token->lock_key; its definition may be a macro/compound literal requiring inspection for side effects or loops.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - A logging macro/function used on error paths. If this is a macro it might expand into complex code (possibly containing for loops). To be confident no malformed for loops are introduced via logging, its definition and expansion must be inspected.\n\n- OS_Unlock_Global_Impl\n  - The direct callee. Even though OS_Unlock_Global itself contains no for loop, MISRA requires analysis of any for loops whose body includes calls to other functions; if OS_Unlock_Global_Impl contains for loops or if it is a function called inside a for loop in other contexts, its implementation must be examined for well\u2011formedness and for whether it modifies any loop counters or uses objects modified in loop bodies.\n\nNotes:\n- The MISRA rule concerns the syntactic and semantic well\u2011formedness of for loops and also the behaviour of called functions inside loop bodies. To be thorough we must be able to inspect (a) any macros/constants used in the conditional/assignments (they may expand to code containing loops), (b) the structures and fields referenced (their accessors might be macros/functions), and (c) the bodies of called functions (OS_Unlock_Global_Impl, OS_DEBUG) that could contain loops or side effects affecting loop counters/flags.\n- If any of the above symbols are themselves macros that reference other symbols, those downstream symbols will also need to be included in the next analysis step."
