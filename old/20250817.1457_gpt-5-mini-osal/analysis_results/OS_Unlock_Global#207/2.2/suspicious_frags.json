Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The fragments above should be investigated because they are the only places in the provided code that consist solely (or primarily) of diagnostic/logging operations which, given the provided #define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) (empty), result in conditional blocks or statements that have no effect at runtime. Other code in the function(s) was not selected because it performs observable side effects or is necessary control logic: - The guard if (token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER && token->lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE) controls whether unlocking and state mutation occur and thus cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. - The assignments objtype->owner_key = OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID and token->lock_key = OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID change state and are observable. - The call OS_Unlock_Global_Impl(token->obj_type) invokes synchronization primitives (pthread_cond_broadcast / pthread_mutex_unlock) which have inter-thread effects and timing implications; these cannot be removed without changing behaviour. - The impl != NULL check in OS_Unlock_Global_Impl gates those synchronization calls and is therefore not dead. - Constant/definition lines (OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER, OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE, OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID) are definitions used by the logic and are not redundant. These non-selected fragments therefore do not appear to be dead code based on the provided code and definitions."
