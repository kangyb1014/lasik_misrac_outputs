  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s claim is not correct as applied to the shown function. The outer if-body contains real, observable actions (reading objtype, clearing objtype->owner_key, clearing token->lock_key and calling OS_Unlock_Global_Impl). Only the small inner diagnostic branches (the inner if that only calls OS_DEBUG, and the else that only logs via OS_DEBUG) would become no-ops when OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro. Whether those diagnostic calls are \u201cdead code\u201d in the MISRA sense depends on the project configuration (if OS_DEBUG is empty across the project and the condition/branch is executed at runtime, then the diagnostic call itself would be a no-op), but that does not make the whole OS_Unlock_Global implementation dead. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect behaviour \u2014 this could arguably apply to an isolated logging call compiled away, but the report as stated incorrectly asserts that the conditional block (the outer if) is dead; it is not. Also the provided test attempt did not build and therefore does not demonstrate a runtime trace proving a rule violation in the project. In short: the diagnostic-only statements could be no-ops in some builds, but the function itself contains substantive behaviour, so the agent\u2019s blanket claim that OS_Unlock_Global violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct without further project-wide evidence."
