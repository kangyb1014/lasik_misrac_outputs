  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Unlock_Global:\n```c\nvoid OS_Unlock_Global(OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_objtype_state_t *objtype;\n\n    if (token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER && token->lock_mode != OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE)\n    {\n        objtype = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type];\n\n        /*\n         * Un-track ownership of this table.

  "scenario": "The if (ret != 0) branch contains only a call to OS_DEBUG and a comment. In the provided project OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro, so the logging call and its arguments (including strerror(ret)) are not present in the compiled code. That makes the entire error-handling branch effectively a no-op at runtime: the conditional test and its empty body have no effect on program behaviour, so removing the whole if-block would not change program behaviour. This constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
