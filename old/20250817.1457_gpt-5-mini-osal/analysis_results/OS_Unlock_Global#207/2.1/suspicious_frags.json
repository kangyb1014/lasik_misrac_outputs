  "explanation": "I identified all conditional branches and the key statements that may be unreachable: the outer if/else, the inner owner-key mismatch check and its debug branch, the assignments that clear keys, and the call to OS_Unlock_Global_Impl. These are the locations where unreachable-code issues are most likely to appear (e.g. because the conditions could be constant, contradictory, or the compiler/runtime could make a branch never taken).\n\nOther parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: the local declaration (OS_objtype_state_t *objtype;) and the comment block are not executable code and cannot be 'unreachable' in the sense of MISRA Rule 2.1; simple sequential statements inside the taken branch that I have already listed (the assignments and the call) are covered above. The function prologue/epilogue and closing braces are structural and not candidates for unreachable-code analysis. No other distinct executable fragments exist in the supplied function body that would meaningfully indicate unreachable code beyond the fragments listed."
