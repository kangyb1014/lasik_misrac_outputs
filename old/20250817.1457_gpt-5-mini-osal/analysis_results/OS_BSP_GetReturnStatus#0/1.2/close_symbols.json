  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations/definitions of all externally referenced symbols to see if they employ non\u2011standard constructs (attributes, compiler keywords, nonstandard enum/typedef syntax, asm labels, storage\u2011class extensions, etc.).\n\n- OS_BSP_Global (variable and its struct/union tag and full definition): The function reads OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus. The full definition is required to check for any compiler-specific extensions applied at the variable or type level (e.g. __attribute__, section/align pragmas, non\u2011standard storage qualifiers, bit\u2011field width extensions, anonymous/unnamed struct/union extensions).\n\n- AppStatus (the member declaration/type within OS_BSP_Global): You must know the exact type of AppStatus (enum, signed/unsigned integral type, typedef) to detect any non\u2011standard enum declarations or typedefs that use compiler extensions (for example vendor attributes, fixed underlying type extensions, or nonstandard qualifiers).\n\n- OS_SUCCESS (macro/enum/constant definition): Case labels use this symbol. Inspect its definition to ensure it is a standard constant or enum and does not employ compiler extensions (e.g. GCC __extension__, asm constants, unusual suffixes or attributes in the definition).\n\n- OS_ERROR (macro/enum/constant definition): Same reason as OS_SUCCESS \u2014 the case label value must be checked for any nonstandard definition or use of compiler extensions.\n\n- EXIT_SUCCESS (macro definition, usually from <stdlib.h> or project header): The code maps OS_SUCCESS to EXIT_SUCCESS. Confirm whether EXIT_SUCCESS comes from the standard header or a project/implementation header that might redefine it with extensions or nonstandard constructs.\n\n- EXIT_FAILURE (macro definition, usually from <stdlib.h> or project header): Same as EXIT_SUCCESS \u2014 verify the macro definition for any compiler\u2011specific extensions.\n\nOnly these symbol definitions are needed to establish whether the target function relies on any non\u2011standard/implementation extensions in the referenced objects or constants. Other local language constructs used (switch, case, bitwise &, integer literal 0x7F, return) are standard C and require no additional symbols for this MISRA check."
