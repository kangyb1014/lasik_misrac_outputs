  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in this function. The code uses only standard C constructs (function definition, local int, switch/case/default/break, bitwise &, return). EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are standard macros from <stdlib.h>, not compiler extensions. There are no vendor-specific keywords or attributes (for example __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, or other known GCC/MSVC/Clang extensions), no inline assembly, no variable-length arrays, no designated initializers or compound literals, and no other nonstandard syntax. The comment about implementation-defined behavior relates to platform-defined semantics of exit status values, not a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
