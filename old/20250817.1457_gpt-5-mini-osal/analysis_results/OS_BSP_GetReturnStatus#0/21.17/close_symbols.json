  "explanation": "You must inspect any symbol that could (a) expand to code that calls string.h functions or (b) reveal that AppStatus is not a plain integral value (for example a pointer or structure that could cause string operations). Specifically:\n- OS_BSP_Global: to see the object actually referenced by the switch and to locate the AppStatus field.\n- (type/struct definition of OS_BSP_Global): to determine the declared type of AppStatus (integral vs pointer/array/struct) and any side effects, bitfields, or accessor macros that could hide string handling.\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus: to confirm its type, valid value range, and whether its access is implemented via macro or function that might call string functions.\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: to ensure these case labels are simple integer constants and do not expand to expressions or function-like macros that could perform string operations or buffer accesses.\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE: to confirm they are simple integer macros (from stdlib.h) and do not introduce string handling.\n- <stdlib.h> (if present): to verify the standard definitions of EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE used in this build.\n- BSP/OS headers that define the above macros (e.g. os-bsp.h, os-config.h): to inspect any macro definitions or inline functions used by the BSP/OS that could hide calls to string.h functions.\n\nWith these symbols you can determine whether any identifier in OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus expands to or calls string handling functions that might cause out-of-bounds accesses; if all of the above are plain integral constants/fields, the function cannot violate the quoted string.h MISRA rule because it contains no string operations."
