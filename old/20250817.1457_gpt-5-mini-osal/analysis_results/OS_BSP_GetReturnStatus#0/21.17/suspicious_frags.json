  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because the rule concerns use of the <string.h> string-handling functions (examples: memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The provided function OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus contains only integer operations and control flow: reading an integer AppStatus, switching on its value, assigning integer constants (EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE) or applying a bitmask (AppStatus & 0x7F). There are no calls to any <string.h> functions, no pointer parameters used for buffer access, and no array or buffer copying/length computations in this fragment. Therefore there are no fragments relevant to Rule 21.17 to report."
