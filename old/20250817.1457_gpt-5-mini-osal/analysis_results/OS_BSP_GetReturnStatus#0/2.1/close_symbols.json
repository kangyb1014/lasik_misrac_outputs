  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to judge reachability (MISRA: no unreachable code):\n\n- OS_BSP_Global\n  - Needed to locate the global variable (storage, initialiser, linkage) and to find where AppStatus is declared/defined. Whether AppStatus is statically initialised or externally set affects whether any switch arms can be proven unreachable.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (type/definition)\n  - Critical: the switch expression is AppStatus. You must know its type (enum/integer width), its allowed value range, and any const/volatile qualifiers. If AppStatus is an enum limited to two values (OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR) then the default arm could be unreachable; if it can take other values the default is reachable.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS\n  - The switch has a case for OS_SUCCESS. You must know the exact definition/value of this symbol to determine whether it and other cases cover all possible AppStatus values.\n\n- OS_ERROR\n  - Same as OS_SUCCESS: need its definition/value to see whether the labelled case(s) exhaust AppStatus domain.\n\n- main\n  - main is a caller (per the call graph). It may initialise or set OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus before calling OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus. Inspecting main is necessary to see the runtime values AppStatus can have at the call site and whether some switch arms are unreachable in the program context.\n\n- OS_BSP_Initialize\n- OS_Application_Startup\n- OS_Application_Run\n  - These functions are callees of main (per the call graph) and are likely places that initialise or modify OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus. To prove a switch arm unreachable you must examine all code paths that can affect AppStatus prior to the call site (initialisation and runtime assignments). Include these functions so the analyzer can find any assignments to AppStatus (or confirm there are none), and thus determine if any switch branch is never reachable.\n\nNotes: The values of EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE are irrelevant to reachability of the switch arms (they affect only the returned value), so they were omitted. Also include any headers or enum definitions discovered while inspecting the above symbols if they define AppStatus domain or OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR values."
