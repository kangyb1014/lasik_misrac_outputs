The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus could violate the MISRA 'for loop well-formed' requirement you must confirm that no hidden or macro-expanded for-loop behaviour or side effects exist in any symbol referenced by the function. The required symbols and why they are needed:\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: The global object whose member is read in the switch. You must inspect its definition to ensure the read is a simple object access (not a macro/function call that could contain or invoke a for loop or have side effects relevant to loop rules).\n\n- AppStatus (member of OS_BSP_Global): The specific member used in the switch. Its declaration (type, whether it is a macro, accessor, volatile, or implemented via inline function) must be checked to ensure evaluating it cannot introduce side effects or hidden loop constructs.\n\n- type/struct definition of OS_BSP_Global: The full type/struct/typedef is needed to check whether AppStatus is a simple integer/enum or a more complex construct (e.g. bit-field, accessor macro, or computed property) that could hide additional behaviour.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR: The case labels. These may be enums or macros\u2014if macros they could expand to expressions (unlikely but must be checked) or be tied to other definitions that introduce side effects or control-flow constructs. Verify they are simple constant values.\n\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE: The values assigned in the cases. These are usually macros (stdlib.h); verify their definitions to ensure they are simple integer constants and not macros that expand to code with side effects or loop constructs.\n\nChecking these symbols ensures that the switch and assignments in OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus do not rely on macros or functions that could contain for-loops or side effects that would affect compliance with the MISRA for-loop requirements. No functions are called from within this function, so no additional callee function bodies are required for the for-loop rule analysis."
