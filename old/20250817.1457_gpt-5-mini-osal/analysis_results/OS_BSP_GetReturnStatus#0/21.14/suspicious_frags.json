  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related symbols for any use of memcmp or for comparing null-terminated strings with memory-comparison functions. No occurrences were found: there are no includes or calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or similar string-comparison functions; the code operates solely on integer values (OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus, numeric macros, and a bitmask). Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and nothing further here needs investigation for that rule."
