  "explanation": "- OS_BSP_Global: The function reads OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus; the definition/declaration of this global (structure/union/variable) is needed to determine the type of AppStatus and whether any indirection/macros hide calls to string functions (e.g., if the global is implemented via accessors that call other routines).\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus: The exact type and possible values for the AppStatus field are required to decide whether AppStatus is a numeric enum/integer (safe) or a pointer/ string-like object (which would make bitwise operations or comparisons suspect and could indicate indirect string comparisons).\n- OS_SUCCESS: The concrete definition (enum constant or macro) is required to ensure it is a simple numeric constant and does not expand to or call any function that might use memcmp on strings.\n- OS_ERROR: Same reason as OS_SUCCESS \u2014 need the definition to confirm it is a simple numeric value and not a macro/function that hides string comparison.\n- EXIT_SUCCESS: Provided by the standard library (stdlib.h); include its definition to ensure no unexpected macro substitution. This helps confirm the function only translates enum values to standard exit codes and does not invoke any string comparison.\n- EXIT_FAILURE: Same as EXIT_SUCCESS \u2014 include to confirm no hidden behavior.\n- memcmp: The symbol for the standard library memcmp is required so the analyzer can check whether this function (or any macros that expand to it) is referenced directly or indirectly by any of the symbols above. The MISRA rule being checked specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, so the presence/usage of memcmp (direct or via macro/wrapper) in any code paths reachable from this function must be known."
