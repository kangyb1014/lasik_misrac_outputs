  "explanation": "- OS_BSP_Global (variable/structure definition): needed to determine the exact declared type of the global object. If OS_BSP_Global were a pointer type or contained pointer members accessed here, the MISRA rule about pointers pointing to const could apply. Confirming it is an object (not a pointer) removes pointer concerns.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (member type / typedef): the precise type of AppStatus (int, enum, signed/unsigned char, typedef, etc.) is required to confirm that the switch expression is an integer-compatible type and not a pointer. If AppStatus were a pointer type (or a typedef to a pointer), pointer const-qualification rules would be relevant.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS (macro or enum definition) and OS_ERROR (macro or enum definition): their underlying types determine whether the comparisons in the switch are integer-to-integer or involve other types. If these were defined in an unusual way that introduces pointers (very unlikely), that would affect the MISRA pointer-to-const analysis.\n\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE (definitions, typically from <stdlib.h>): verify these are integer constants (as normally defined). If they expanded to or involved pointer expressions (not the case in standard C), that could raise pointer const-qualification concerns.\n\n- Header(s) that declare/define the above (the BSP/OS header files): the actual declarations/typedefs are typically in headers; obtaining those headers lets you inspect any typedefs/indirections (e.g., AppStatus typedefs) that could hide pointer usage.\n\nTogether these symbols let you confirm whether the function manipulates any pointer types (directly or indirectly). If no pointer types are involved, the MISRA rule about pointing-to-const is not applicable to this function."
