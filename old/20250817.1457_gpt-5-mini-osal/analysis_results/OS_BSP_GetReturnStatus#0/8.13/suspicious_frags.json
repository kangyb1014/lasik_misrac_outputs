  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations/uses: pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. In this function there are no pointer objects or pointer operations to inspect:\n- No pointer declarations (the only local variable is an int: retcode).\n- No pointer parameters (function signature returns int, takes void).\n- No address-of (& applied here is the bitwise operator on an integer, not the address-of operator: OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus & 0x7F).\n- No dereference operations or pointer arithmetic.\n- OS_BSP_Global is accessed with the structure/member operator (.) not the pointer operator (->), so within this snippet it is not a pointer.\n- No casts to or from pointer types, nor any use of function pointers.\nTherefore, based on the provided code fragment, there are no constructs relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 to investigate. If additional code (e.g., the definitions of OS_BSP_Global or surrounding modules) introduces pointers, those would need to be examined, but they are not present in this snippet."
