  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus violates the MISRA rule 'A function parameter should not be modified' we must confirm whether the function actually modifies any parameter or any object that could be a parameter alias. The function has no formal parameters, but it accesses and assigns to OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (reads) and writes to local variable retcode. The items above are required for the analysis: \n\n- OS_BSP_Global (declaration/definition): establishes that this identifier is a global object (not a function parameter). If OS_BSP_Global were a macro alias for e.g. a function parameter or some expression, that could change the analysis. We need the real declaration to be sure.\n\n- type/struct that defines OS_BSP_Global: shows the actual type of the global (struct/typedef) so we can see whether AppStatus is a scalar, pointer, array or something else. If AppStatus were a pointer to a parameter or an alias, that could imply modification of a parameter indirectly.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus (member type and declaration): the code switches on AppStatus and masks it with 0x7F. Knowing the exact type (signed/unsigned/integer width, or pointer) is necessary to ensure the operation is not modifying a pointer parameter or otherwise aliasing a function parameter.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS and OS_ERROR (macro/enum definitions): to verify these are simple constants (not macros that expand to expressions that could modify parameters) and to ensure the comparisons are standard value comparisons.\n\n- EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE (macro definitions): to ensure these are constant values (not function-like macros or macros that could modify parameters). Although these are normally simple integer macros from <stdlib.h>, including them rules out unexpected macro behavior.\n\nWith these symbols we can confirm (1) that the function takes no parameters, (2) that the global referenced is not an alias for a parameter, and (3) that none of the macros used expand to code that modifies a parameter. If all confirm normal definitions (global variable and simple integer macros), the function does not violate the MISRA rule because it does not modify any function parameter."
