  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus:\n```c\nint OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus(void)\n{\n    int retcode;\n\n    switch (OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus)\n    {\n        case OS_SUCCESS:\n            /* translate OS_SUCCESS to the system EXIT_SUCCESS value (usually 0) */\n            retcode = EXIT_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n\n        case OS_ERROR:\n            /* translate OS_ERROR to the system EXIT_FAILURE value (usually 1) */\n            retcode = EXIT_FAILURE;\n            break;\n\n        default:\n            /* any other value will be passed through (implementation-defined) */\n            /* Range is limited to 0-127, however */\n            retcode = OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus & 0x7F;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    return retcode;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ndefault:\n            /* any other value will be passed through (implementation-defined) */\n            /* Range is limited to 0-127, however */\n            retcode = OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus & 0x7F;\n            break;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated for the shown fragment. The default case produces the return value when OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus is neither OS_SUCCESS nor OS_ERROR, so its removal would change program behaviour. A concrete violation scenario would be if the assignment in the default case is always overwritten later before the value is used (e.g. code later unconditionally assigns retcode a different value before return), making the default assignment executed but removable without changing behaviour. In the provided function that is not the case, so Rule 2.2 is not violated."
