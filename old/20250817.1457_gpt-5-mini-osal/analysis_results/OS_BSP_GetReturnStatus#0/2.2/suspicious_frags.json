The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The listed fragments are the code paths where removal or redundancy could be present (explicit OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR mappings and the masked passthrough). Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 2.2: the function signature and prototype (int OS_BSP_GetReturnStatus(void)) are required interface elements; the local declaration (int retcode;) is used and not dead; comments are non-executable and not subject to dead-code analysis; the final return statement (return retcode;) is necessary to return the computed value; the opening/closing braces and spacing are structural and not executable dead code. No other executable statements appear outside the reported fragments that could be candidates for removal without affecting behaviour."
