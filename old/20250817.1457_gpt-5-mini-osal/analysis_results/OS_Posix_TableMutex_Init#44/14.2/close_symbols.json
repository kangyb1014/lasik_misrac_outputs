The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether this function violates the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule you must inspect any macros/inline functions or global objects referenced by the function because: (1) the rule treats the behaviour of any function called inside a for statement as part of the for-loop body, and (2) macros may expand to for statements. The listed symbols are the minimal additional items required to fully assess that risk:\n\n- OS_DEBUG: Likely a macro (or inline) used for logging. It could expand to code containing loops or loop-like control; must inspect its definition to ensure it does not introduce for-statements or modify loop counters/flags.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: Global array accessed by index; its definition must be checked to ensure the access is not a function-like macro or accessor that could contain for-statements or side effects.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: Type/struct of the table elements. Need to confirm that impl->mutex and impl->cond are plain fields (e.g., pthread types) and not accessors/macros that expand to code with for-loops or side effects.\n- pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutexattr_settype, pthread_mutex_init, pthread_cond_init: These are API calls; if any of them are implemented as macros/inline functions in the build (or expand to code) that include for-statements, those loops would need to be examined under MISRA. Provide their definitions/prototypes/inline implementations if present.\n- strerror: Could be a macro/inline wrapper on some platforms; must check its definition for any loop constructs or side effects.\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR: Constants/symbols used for return values. Include their definitions to ensure they are plain constants and not macros with side effects.\n- PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL: Platform constants/macros used as arguments. Verify they are simple constants (no macro expansion that could introduce code/loops).\n\nWith these symbols/definitions available the next analyzer can confirm that none of the called macros/inline functions or accessed globals introduce for-statements or side effects that would cause a MISRA for-loop rule violation in the context of this function."
