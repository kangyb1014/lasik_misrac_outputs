  "explanation": "I inspected the target function and the related definitions. I found no uses of compiler language extensions that are commonly documented as extensions (for example: GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin__ constructs, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler, unnamed/anonymous structs/unions in a non-standard way, or other vendor-specific keywords like __extension__). Notes on potential points of interest that do NOT indicate language extensions:\n- The variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) is a standard C99 feature (variadic macros), not a compiler extension.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands with address-of on its parameter (&(tok)); this is macro usage/expansion behavior, not a language extension. Its invocation with *token is valid C and results in taking the address of the dereferenced token (i.e., the original pointer), not an extension.\n- static inline functions (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIdToInteger) use standard C inline semantics (C99 and later), not a compiler extension.\n- Use of pthread_setschedprio and other pthread types/functions are POSIX APIs (libraries), not C language extensions.\n- Conditional compilation (#ifdef OSAL_OMIT_DEPRECATED) and member access (object_id.v) are standard preprocessor and struct/union/member usage; they are not necessarily compiler extensions (the exact type of osal_id_t could be a different type in different builds, but that is a portability/ABI issue, not a language-extension usage).\n- Standard typedefs (int32_t, uint8_t) and casts/returns are standard C.\n\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments in the provided code that use explicit compiler language extensions as described by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
