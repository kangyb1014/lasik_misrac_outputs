  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, osal_priority_t new_priority)\n{\n    int os_priority;\n    int ret;\n\n    OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token);\n\n    if (POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities)\n    {\n        /* Change OSAL priority into a priority that will work for this OS */\n        os_priority = OS_PriorityRemap(new_priority);\n\n        /*\n        ** Set priority\n        */\n        ret = pthread_setschedprio(impl->id, os_priority);\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_setschedprio: Task ID = %lu, prio = %d, err = %s\\n\",\n                     OS_ObjectIdToInteger(OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token)), os_priority, strerror(ret));\n            return OS_ERROR;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The assignment 'impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token);' is executed unconditionally, but 'impl' is only used inside the subsequent 'if (POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities)' block. If POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities is false at runtime, the assignment has no effect on program behaviour (the macro and functions used have no observable side effects). Hence the assignment is dead code (it can be removed without changing behaviour when priorities are disabled).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, osal_priority_t new_priority)\n{\n    int os_priority;\n    int ret;\n\n    OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    /* Original unconditional assignment retained */\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token);\n\n    /* Probe: record that the assignment happened and capture the runtime flag */\n    {\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/538.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"[probe] after_assignment: EnableTaskPriorities=%d token_ptr=%p impl_ptr=%p new_priority=%d\\n\",\n                    POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities ? 1 : 0,\n                    (void *)token,\n                    (void *)impl,\n                    (int)new_priority);\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities)\n    {\n        /* Change OSAL priority into a priority that will work for this OS */\n        os_priority = OS_PriorityRemap(new_priority);\n\n        /* Probe: log computed OS priority and impl pointer (and id if available) */\n        {\n            FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/538.txt\", \"a\");\n            if (f != NULL)\n            {\n                /* Avoid dereferencing impl->id unless we are in the branch (we are) and impl is non-NULL */\n                if (impl != NULL)\n                {\n                    fprintf(f, \"[probe] enter_if: impl_ptr=%p impl_id=%lu os_priority=%d\\n\",\n                            (void *)impl,\n                            (unsigned long)impl->id,\n                            os_priority);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    fprintf(f, \"[probe] enter_if: impl_ptr=NULL os_priority=%d\\n\", os_priority);\n                }\n                fclose(f);\n            }\n        }\n\n        /*\n        ** Set priority\n        */\n        ret = pthread_setschedprio(impl->id, os_priority);\n        if (ret != 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_setschedprio: Task ID = %lu, prio = %d, err = %s\\n\",\n                     OS_ObjectIdToInteger(OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token)), os_priority, strerror(ret));\n\n            /* Probe: log the failure details */\n            {\n                FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/538.txt\", \"a\");\n                if (f != NULL)\n                {\n                    fprintf(f, \"[probe] pthread_setschedprio_failed: token_ptr=%p impl_ptr=%p impl_id=%lu os_priority=%d ret=%d\\n\",\n                            (void *)token,\n                            (void *)impl,\n                            (impl != NULL) ?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is not provably dead: it is used later when POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities is true, so removing it would change behaviour in that case. Even if at a particular run the flag is false, MISRA Rule 2.2 concerns code that can affect program behaviour in the project as a whole, not only in one execution. Furthermore, the macro/function used to obtain the record may have observable effects (memory accesses, bounds checks, faults, timing) so its removal could change program behaviour (including timing, which MISRA explicitly calls out). The empty probe log does not demonstrate the assignment is dead \u2014 it only shows the test did not exercise the function or branch. Therefore the claim that this assignment is dead code under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
