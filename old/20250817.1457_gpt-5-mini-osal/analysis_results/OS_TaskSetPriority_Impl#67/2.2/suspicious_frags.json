  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for dead-code under Rule 2.2 for these reasons: \n\n- The if (POSIX_GlobalVars.EnableTaskPriorities) condition depends on an external/global runtime variable; it cannot be assumed constant at compile time, so the block it guards (including pthread_setschedprio and the priority remapping) may be executed and thus is not dead. Removal of the pthread_setschedprio call or the priority remapping would change observable scheduling behaviour.\n\n- The call to OS_PriorityRemap(new_priority) produces a value used by pthread_setschedprio; it has an observable effect when the priority-change path is taken and therefore is not dead.\n\n- The error-path return (return OS_ERROR) and the normal return (return OS_SUCCESS) affect control flow and are not dead.\n\n- Declarations (int os_priority; int ret; OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;) are not executed operations and so are not candidates for dead code under this rule.\n\n- Inline helper accessors/macros used to compute indices/IDs (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIdToInteger, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) when invoked as part of an executed path are observable (they access data used later). Only the specific usage/expressions listed in suspicious_frags above are flagged because they are executed yet appear to have no runtime effect (or are compiled away by an empty debug macro)."
