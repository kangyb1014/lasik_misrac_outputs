  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies either function parameter. The pointer parameter token is never assigned to (no statements like token = ...), and the non-pointer parameter new_priority is not modified (no assignments to new_priority). The uses of token are either dereferencing (*token) to obtain an object for indexing (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token) expands to use &(*token) which is equivalent to the original pointer) or passing the pointer to accessor functions (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdFromToken) that take a const pointer and only read fields. OS_PriorityRemap(new_priority) takes the priority by value and does not alter the parameter in this function. The macro expansion does not perform any assignment to the parameter either. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation with respect to modifying function parameters."
