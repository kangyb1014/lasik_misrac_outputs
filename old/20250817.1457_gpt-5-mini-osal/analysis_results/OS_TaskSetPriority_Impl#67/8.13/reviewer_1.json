  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_TaskSetPriority_Impl the variable impl is only dereferenced for reads (impl->id) and is never used to modify the pointed-to object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer shall point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so declaring impl as\n\n    const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;\n\nis appropriate and allowed (assigning a non-const T * to a const T * is implicit and safe). The supplied probe/test code compiling does not invalidate the rule \u2014 the lack of log output is a test-coverage/runtime issue, not a justification for leaving impl non-const. One caveat: if the implementation intentionally requires a mutable pointer for other reasons (future writes, API compatibility, or required qualifiers like volatile), that would justify keeping it non-const; otherwise the change is correct and would remove the Rule 8.13 violation."
