  "explanation": "Only these fragments involve a pointer to a non-const-qualified object from this function's scope. The function parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' is already const-qualified and therefore not suspicious. Other identifiers (os_priority, ret) are non-pointer scalar types and irrelevant to Rule 8.13. Calls that return or accept pointers from external APIs (strerror, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, OS_PriorityRemap, pthread_setschedprio, OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIdToInteger, OS_DEBUG) are API boundaries or library functions where the pointed-to types/qualifiers are determined by those interfaces; they cannot be changed locally here. No other pointer declarations exist in the function, so there are no additional fragments to investigate for Rule 8.13."
