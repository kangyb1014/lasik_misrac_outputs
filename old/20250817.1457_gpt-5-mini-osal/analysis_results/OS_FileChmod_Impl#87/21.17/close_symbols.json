This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- strerror: The target calls strerror(errno) and the MISRA rule covers use of functions from <string.h>. Inspecting strerror's prototype and implementation is required to determine whether it can access or return pointers that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses when subsequently used (e.g. passed to OS_DEBUG).\n\n- errno: strerror is called with errno and the debug prints use errno in messages. Knowing how errno is used/updated (and whether any intermediate code could make strerror act on unexpected values) helps in reasoning about safety of the strerror result.\n\n- OS_DEBUG (macro/function) and its implementation: OS_DEBUG is called with format specifiers %s and string arguments (local_path and strerror(errno)). The concrete implementation may call printf/vsnprintf or other string functions (memcpy/strcpy/strlen). To decide compliance with the string.h rule you must inspect OS_DEBUG to see which string functions it invokes and whether it could read/write beyond the bounds of the provided char* arguments or copy them into bounded buffers incorrectly.\n\n- OS_chmod (caller): local_path is an input to OS_FileChmod_Impl. To determine if passing local_path into string-handling code is safe (i.e., NUL-terminated and within expected length), you must inspect the caller to see how local_path is produced and validated.\n\n- OS_TranslatePath (and its implementation): OS_chmod calls OS_TranslatePath (per the static call graph). OS_TranslatePath may allocate or write the translated path into a buffer; you need its implementation to confirm that the returned/produced local_path is NUL-terminated and fits within any buffers OS_DEBUG or other string functions might use.\n\n- Path buffer size constants used by OS_chmod/OS_TranslatePath (e.g. OS_MAX_PATH_LEN or equivalent): These constants encode maximum path lengths and buffer sizes. They are necessary to verify that any copying/formatting operations (inside OS_TranslatePath, OS_chmod, OS_DEBUG, etc.) cannot exceed buffer bounds when given local_path.\n\n- vsnprintf/snprintf/printf-family used by OS_DEBUG (and any string.h calls inside OS_DEBUG): If OS_DEBUG internally uses these or any functions from <string.h> (memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, strlen, etc.), those symbols/implementations must be checked to ensure they are used in ways that cannot access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\n\nIn short: focus inspection on strerror and every place that receives, formats, or copies the two string pointers used in debug calls (local_path and strerror(errno)) \u2014 i.e., the caller path creation (OS_chmod/OS_TranslatePath), OS_DEBUG's implementation, and any string/printf routines OS_DEBUG invokes plus the path-size limits. These are the symbols needed to determine if any string.h function could access out-of-bounds memory in this routine."
