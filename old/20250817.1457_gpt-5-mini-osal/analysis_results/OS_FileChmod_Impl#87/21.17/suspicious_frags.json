  "explanation": "I found no calls to the <string.h> functions listed by the rule (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) or any other buffer-manipulating string functions that take pointer parameters referencing user buffers. The only string-related usage is strerror(errno) inside OS_DEBUG calls; strerror does not accept a user buffer pointer (it returns a pointer to an internal static string) and therefore does not present a bounds-access risk under Rule 21.17. The code otherwise performs system calls (open, fstat, fchmod, close) and bitwise operations on st_mode, none of which involve <string.h> string-handling functions that could access beyond object bounds. Consequently, there are no fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
