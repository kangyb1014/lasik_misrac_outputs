  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp is present in the provided code. A search through the function body and the related definitions shows only system calls (open, fstat, fchmod, close) and library calls that do not perform string comparisons (strerror is used only for logging). There are no explicit string comparisons, no memcmp calls, and no wrapper macros or external symbols in the supplied additional code that suggest an indirect use of memcmp. The comparisons in the code are integer/bitwise (access_mode, st.st_mode, uid/gid checks), not string comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
