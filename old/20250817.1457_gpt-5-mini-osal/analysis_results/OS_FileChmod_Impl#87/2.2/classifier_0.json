The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileChmod_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileChmod_Impl(const char *local_path, uint32 access_mode)\n{\n    mode_t      readbits;\n    mode_t      writebits;\n    struct stat st;\n    int         fd;\n    int32       status;\n\n    /* Open file to avoid filename race potential */\n    fd = open(local_path, O_RDONLY, 0);\n    if (fd < 0)\n    {\n        fd = open(local_path, O_WRONLY, 0);\n        if (fd < 0)\n        {\n            OS_DEBUG(\"open(%s): %s (%d)\\n\", local_path, strerror(errno), errno);\n            return OS_ERROR;\n        }\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * NOTE: After this point, execution must proceed to the end of this routine\n     * so that the \"fd\" opened above can be properly closed.\n     */\n\n    /*\n     * In order to preserve any OTHER mode bits,\n     * first stat() the file and then modify the st_mode\n     * to match the desired access level.\n     *\n     * In particular, this should preserve the execute bit,\n     * which is generally not part of the OSAL API, but\n     * is important for the underlying OS.\n     */\n    if (fstat(fd, &st) < 0)\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"fstat(%s): %s (%d)\\n\", local_path, strerror(errno), errno);\n        status = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* always check world bits */\n        readbits  = S_IROTH;\n        writebits = S_IWOTH;\n\n        if (OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID == st.st_uid)\n        {\n            /* we own the file so use user bits */\n            readbits |= S_IRUSR;\n            writebits |= S_IWUSR;\n        }\n\n        if (OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID == st.st_gid)\n        {\n            /* our group owns the file so use group bits */\n            readbits |= S_IRGRP;\n            writebits |= S_IWGRP;\n        }\n\n        if (access_mode == OS_WRITE_ONLY || access_mode == OS_READ_WRITE)\n        {\n            /* set all \"write\" mode bits */\n            st.st_mode |= writebits;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /* clear all \"write\" mode bits */\n            st.st_mode &= ~writebits;\n        }\n\n        if (access_mode == OS_READ_ONLY || access_mode == OS_READ_WRITE)\n        {\n            /* set all \"read\" mode bits */\n            st.st_mode |= readbits;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            /* clear all \"read\" mode bits */\n            st.st_mode &= ~readbits;\n        }\n\n        /* finally, write the modified mode back to the file */\n        if (fchmod(fd, st.st_mode) < 0)\n        {\n            /*\n             * These particular errnos generally indicate that the\n             * underlying filesystem does not support chmod()\n             *\n             * This is often the case for FAT / DOSFS filesystems\n             * which do not have UNIX-style permissions, or (in the\n             * case of EROFS) if the filesystem is mounted read-only.\n             */\n            if (errno == ENOTSUP || errno == ENOSYS || errno == EROFS)\n            {\n                status = OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                OS_DEBUG(\"fchmod(%s): %s (%d)\\n\", local_path, strerror(errno), errno);\n                status = OS_ERROR;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            status = OS_SUCCESS;\n        }\n    }\n\n    close(fd);\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_FileChmod_Impl:\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\nextern uid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID\n...\nextern gid_t OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID\n...\n#define OS_WRITE_ONLY 1\n...\n#define OS_READ_WRITE 2\n...\n#define OS_READ_ONLY 0\n...\n#define OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED (-28)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

Rule 2.2 concerns executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; since there is no runtime code here, this does not violate the rule. (A violation would occur if OS_DEBUG expanded to an executed no-op function call that could be removed without changing behaviour.)"
