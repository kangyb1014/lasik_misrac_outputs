  "explanation": "Each listed symbol can affect control flow or could be a macro/constant whose definition would make certain branches provably unreachable at analysis time. Brief rationale:\n\n- OS_READ_ONLY, OS_WRITE_ONLY, OS_READ_WRITE: The function compares access_mode to these constants to decide mutually exclusive branches that set/clear read/write bits. If their definitions overlap or collapse to the same value, some branches become compile-time unreachable.\n\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: Used in equality tests against st.st_uid/st.st_gid. If defined such that the comparisons are always true or always false (e.g., macros or compile-time constants used by the build), the blocks that set user/group bits could be unreachable.\n\n- OS_ERROR, OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, OS_SUCCESS: Return/status constants used in early returns and final return. If any are defined in an unexpected way (e.g., as expressions with side effects or macros that include returns), they could alter reachability; their values also indicate which return paths exist.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: Macro/function invoked on error paths. It could be a macro that expands into control-flow constructs (e.g., containing a return/abort) which would make subsequent code unreachable. Its definition must be known to determine reachability of code following its invocation.\n\n- open, fstat, fchmod, close, strerror: These library calls determine runtime decisions (success/failure) that select branches. While their runtime outcomes are dynamic, their declarations/macros are needed to detect if they were wrapped or redefined as macros that change control flow or cause early returns.\n\n- errno, ENOTSUP, ENOSYS, EROFS: The fchmod error handling branches depend on errno comparisons against these macros. If these macros are aliased or errno is implemented unusually (e.g., as an expression), certain error-handling branches could be unreachable.\n\n- mode_t, struct stat, S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP: These types/macros are used to construct st_mode and compute bitmasks. If any are defined in nonstandard ways (macros, constants, or empty), the bitwise branches (setting/clearing bits) might be compiled away or become unreachable.\n\n- O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY: Flags used in the two open() attempts. If these are defined such that the first open call is equivalent to the second or open is a macro, the control path that attempts the second open or the early return may be affected.\n\nProviding definitions or declarations for these symbols (macros, constants, and function prototypes) is necessary for a static analysis to determine whether any branch or statement in OS_FileChmod_Impl is provably unreachable under the project's build configuration."
