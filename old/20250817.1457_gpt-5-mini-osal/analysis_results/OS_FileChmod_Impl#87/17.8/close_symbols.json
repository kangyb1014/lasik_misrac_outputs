  "explanation": "For verifying MISRA C rule \"A function parameter should not be modified\" for OS_FileChmod_Impl the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_DEBUG: often a macro expanded inline; since macros are expanded in the function body they can reference and assign to parameter identifiers (e.g. local_path or access_mode). The macro definition is needed to prove it does not write to the parameter names.\n- open: prototype/behavior. Although a normal function cannot reassign the caller's parameter variable (it receives a value), knowing its prototype confirms it is called with local_path and cannot directly mutate the local_path identifier. Also ensures it does not take char ** or similar.\n- fstat: prototype/behavior; confirms fstat takes fd and &st (no way to change the parameter variables) and that it does not accept local_path in a way that could rebind the parameter.\n- fchmod: prototype/behavior; same reasoning as fstat \u2014 ensure it cannot reassign the local pointer variable.\n- close: prototype/behavior; ensure closing fd does not affect parameters.\n- strerror: prototype/behavior and whether it is a macro; if it were a macro it could expand to code referencing local identifiers.\n- errno: symbol/type (possibly macro or lvalue). Needed to check uses such as errno == ENOTSUP; if errno were a macro that expanded in a way that could assign to parameters, that must be known.\n- struct stat (definition including st_mode, st_uid, st_gid): The code reads/writes st.st_mode; analyzer must know these members exist and their types to ensure no aliasing to the parameters occurs (e.g., odd platform-specific definitions that might alias to local_path \u2014 unlikely but checkable).\n- mode_t (typedef): type of st_mode and readbits/writebits; needed to reason about bit operations and that these operations do not involve parameter assignment.\n- S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP: permission macros/constants used to build readbits/writebits and modify st.st_mode; need to ensure none are macros that expand to code that could touch local identifiers.\n- OS_IMPL_SELF_EUID, OS_IMPL_SELF_EGID: compared against st.st_uid/st_gid; include definitions to ensure they are simple constants/expressions and not macros that modify parameters.\n- OS_WRITE_ONLY, OS_READ_ONLY, OS_READ_WRITE: values compared to access_mode; definitions ensure these are constants (not macros that could expand into assignments) and allow confirming access_mode is only read, not written.\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: return-code constants; include to confirm status assignments do not alias or modify parameters.\n- ENOTSUP, ENOSYS, EROFS: errno constants used in comparisons; include to rule out macro side-effects.\n- uint32 (typedef): type of access_mode; include to ensure access_mode is passed by value and cannot be indirectly modified by called functions.\n\nIn short, include any macros and typedefs used in expressions (especially OS_DEBUG and any macro-like symbols) plus the prototypes/types of called functions so the analyzer can determine whether any code path (including macro expansions) assigns to the formal parameters local_path or access_mode. This set is minimal to establish that no assignment to the parameter identifiers occurs in the function body or via macro expansions."
