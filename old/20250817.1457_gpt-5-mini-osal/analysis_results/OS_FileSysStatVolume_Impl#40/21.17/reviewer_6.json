  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, OS_statvfs_t *result)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local;\n    struct statvfs                stat_buf;\n\n    local = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token);\n\n    if (statvfs(local->system_mountpt, &stat_buf) != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    result->block_size   = OSAL_SIZE_C(stat_buf.f_bsize);\n    result->blocks_free  = OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(stat_buf.f_bfree);\n    result->total_blocks = OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(stat_buf.f_blocks);\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:Yes \u2014 OS_CHECK_STRING(fsdevname, sizeof(filesys->device_name), ...) likely invokes string.h routines (e.g. memchr/strnlen) using the destination buffer size as the maximum probe length. If the object pointed to by fsdevname is smaller than sizeof(filesys->device_name) (for example a caller-supplied buffer of 8 bytes) and does not contain a NUL within that smaller allocation, the string routine will be asked to read beyond the bounds of the fsdevname object, producing an out-of-bounds access. This would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, OS_statvfs_t *result)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local;\n    struct statvfs                stat_buf;\n    FILE *logf = NULL;\n    time_t tnow;\n\n    /* Preserve original behavior: get the local filesystem record */\n    local = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token);\n\n    /* Open probe log (append) to capture control flow and relevant state. */\n    logf = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/327.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (logf != NULL)\n    {\n        tnow = time(NULL);\n        fprintf(logf, \"\\n---- OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl probe @ %ld ----\\n\", (long)tnow);\n        fprintf(logf, \"token ptr = %p\\n\", (const void *)token);\n        fprintf(logf, \"local record ptr = %p\\n\", (void *)local);\n\n        /* Log mountpoint pointer only (do NOT read beyond its bounds). */\n        if (local != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"local->system_mountpt ptr = %p\\n\", (const void *)local->system_mountpt);\n\n            /* Note: We deliberately do NOT attempt to read or print the contents of\n             * local->system_mountpt here because doing so could itself cause an\n             * out-of-bounds access if the object is smaller than an assumed size.\n             * This probe logs pointer values and runtime results so that other\n             * tools/agents can reason about potential size mismatches without\n             * introducing additional unsafe reads. */\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"local is NULL\\n\");\n        }\n\n        fflush(logf);\n    }\n\n    /* Call the original statvfs as before */\n    if (statvfs(local->system_mountpt, &stat_buf) != 0)\n    {\n        /* Log failure details */\n        if (logf != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"statvfs FAILED: errno=%d (%s)\\n\", errno, strerror(errno));\n            fprintf(logf, \"Returning OS_ERROR\\n\");\n            fclose(logf);\n        }\n\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    /* Log statvfs results prior to assignment */\n    if (logf != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(logf, \"statvfs succeeded\\n\");\n        fprintf(logf, \"stat_buf.f_bsize = %llu\\n\", (unsigned long long)stat_buf.f_bsize);\n        fprintf(logf, \"stat_buf.f_bfree = %llu\\n\", (unsigned long long)stat_buf.f_bfree);\n        fprintf(logf, \"stat_buf.f_blocks = %llu\\n\", (unsigned long long)stat_buf.f_blocks);\n        fflush(logf);\n    }\n\n    /* Preserve original assignments */\n    result->block_size   = OSAL_SIZE_C(stat_buf.f_bsize);\n    result->blocks_free  = OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(stat_buf.f_bfree);\n    result->total_blocks = OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C(stat_buf.f_blocks);\n\n    if (logf != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(logf, \"Assigned result->block_size = %llu\\n\", (unsigned long long)result->block_size);\n        fprintf(logf, \"Assigned result->blocks_free = %llu\\n\", (unsigned long long)result->blocks_free);\n        fprintf(logf, \"Assigned result->total_blocks = %llu\\n\", (unsigned long long)result->total_blocks);\n        fprintf(logf, \"Returning OS_SUCCESS\\n\");\n        fclose(logf);\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl.

  "explanation": "The reported violation is not supported by the provided OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl code. The function does not call any of the <string.h> string-handling functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). It simply passes local->system_mountpt to statvfs; statvfs is not a <string.h> routine and the rule specifically targets the Standard Library functions in <string.h>.\n\nAgent A's scenario refers to an OS_CHECK_STRING invocation (and its internal use of strnlen/memchr/etc.), which could indeed cause out-of-bounds reads if the supplied buffer is shorter than the length argument. That would be a valid concern for code that actually uses the <string.h> functions with an incorrect length. However, no such call appears in the submitted OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl snippet, so the claim that this function violates MISRA 21.17 is incorrect.\n\nNote: there is a separate, real safety requirement here \u2014 callers must ensure local->system_mountpt points to a valid NUL-terminated string within its allocated bounds before calling statvfs. If some other macro (e.g. OS_CHECK_STRING) used elsewhere performs string.h operations with an incorrect size argument, that other code should be fixed. But that issue is not demonstrated in this function as shown."
