Under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer should be to a const-qualified type whenever possible. If this member is intended to point to immutable data (for example a static device/volume name or read-only memory), it should be declared as 'const char *address;'. As written it violates Rule 8.13 unless there is a documented need to modify the pointed-to data (i.e., a justification/exception).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void os_fs_log_volume_probe(const OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local,\n                                   const struct statvfs *stat_buf,\n                                   const char *stage,\n                                   int err)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/323.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return; /* If logging cannot be performed, do not affect original logic */\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"[OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl] stage=%s\\n\", (stage != NULL) ? stage : \"(null)\");\n\n    if (local == NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"  local = NULL\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Log pointer value of local and the mount point pointer and contents (if present) */\n        fprintf(f, \"  local ptr=%p\\n\", (const void *)local);\n        fprintf(f, \"  local->system_mountpt ptr=%p\\n\",\n                (const void *)local->system_mountpt);\n\n        if (local->system_mountpt != NULL)\n        {\n            /* Print up to a reasonable length to avoid overly large logs */\n            fprintf(f, \"  local->system_mountpt value=\\\"\");\n\n            /* Print safely: limit to first 512 chars */\n            {\n                const char *s = local->system_mountpt;\n                size_t i;\n                for (i = 0; (s[i] != '\\0') && (i < 512); ++i)\n                {\n                    /* Print character-by-character to avoid buffer assumptions */\n                    fputc((unsigned char)s[i], f);\n                }\n                if (s[i] != '\\0')\n                {\n                    fprintf(f, \"...

  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the provided code. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointer types be const-qualified when the pointed-to data is not modified, but whether a violation exists depends on the declaration and intended use of the pointer member (e.g. local->system_mountpt). The snippet shown does not include the definition of OS_filesys_internal_record_t or the declaration of system_mountpt, so you cannot tell from this function alone whether the member is declared as char * or const char *. Also, the code only reads the mount-point string and passes it to statvfs, which takes a const char * \u2014 passing a char * to a const char * parameter is allowed and does not itself violate the rule. Therefore there is insufficient evidence to conclude a MISRA 8.13 violation; it may be a real issue if system_mountpt is declared as non-const and there is no reason to modify it, but that declaration/context is not shown, so Agent A's definite claim is not correct as presented."
