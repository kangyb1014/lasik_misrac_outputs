In OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl this is used as: local = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token); local is declared as OS_filesys_internal_record_t * but is only read (system_mountpt is accessed). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible. Here the pointer is not const-qualified (and the macro does not produce a const-qualified pointer), so the rule is violated. A fix is to declare local as const OS_filesys_internal_record_t * (or have the macro return a pointer to const).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_FileSysStatVolume_LogProbe(const char *stage,\n                                          const void *token_ptr,\n                                          void *local_ptr,\n                                          int statvfs_ret,\n                                          const struct statvfs *stat_buf,\n                                          const void *result_ptr)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/323.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging fails, do not alter program behavior. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    time_t now = time(NULL);\n    fprintf(f, \"[%ld] OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl probe: %s\\n\", (long)now, stage);\n    fprintf(f, \"  token pointer: %p\\n\", token_ptr);\n    fprintf(f, \"  local pointer: %p\\n\", local_ptr);\n    /* Note: local->system_mountpt is accessed in the original function; try to\n     * print it if available.

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. In OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl the local variable is declared as a non-const pointer (OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local) but the function only reads from the object (it only accesses local->system_mountpt and does not modify the pointed-to record). MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible; here that is possible and appropriate, so local should be declared as const OS_filesys_internal_record_t *local (or the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro could be adjusted to yield a pointer-to-const). Assigning the non-const pointer produced by the macro to a pointer-to-const is allowed (no qualifier removal), so the change is safe provided the function does not need to modify the object. Therefore the reported violation is valid."
