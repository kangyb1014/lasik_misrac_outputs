  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function are statically unreachable. Explanation of reachability analysis: \n\n- Control flow: The function has a single conditional (if (statvfs(...) != 0)) that may either return OS_ERROR or continue to populate the result and return OS_SUCCESS. Both the true and false branches are reachable at runtime depending on the return value of statvfs; there are no statements after an unconditional return that would be dead.\n\n- Macro usage: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token) expands to &OS_filesys_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))]. The &( *token ) expression is valid because *token is an lvalue; the expansion does not introduce unreachable code. The inlined OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx, which is a plain indexing operation and does not produce dead code.\n\n- No compile-time constant conditionals, no unconditional loops, no labels/gotos that skip code, and no code placed after unconditional returns exist in the function. All assignments to result (block_size, blocks_free, total_blocks) are reachable when statvfs succeeds.\n\nGiven these points, there are no fragments in the given function that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code). If you want investigation of potential runtime errors or undefined behavior (e.g., out-of-range obj_idx, non-null-terminated mount point, or statvfs failure modes), those are different MISRA concerns but are not evidence of unreachable code."
