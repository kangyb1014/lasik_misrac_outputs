  "explanation": "No pointer parameters are reassigned in this function. The parameters are:\n- const OS_object_token_t *token: The code only dereferences *token when calling OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET; this reads the referenced object but does not modify the pointer parameter itself. The token pointer is not assigned to anywhere.\n- OS_statvfs_t *result: The code writes to members of the object pointed to by result (result->block_size, result->blocks_free, result->total_blocks). MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 permits modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter; it only forbids modifying the pointer variable itself. The result pointer is not reassigned.\nAll other assignments (local = ..., stat_buf, and calls) operate on local variables or objects not involving reassignment of the parameter pointers. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be investigated for this rule."
