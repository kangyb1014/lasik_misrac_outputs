  "explanation": "No executed operations in OS_FileSysStatVolume_Impl appear to be dead code. Each statement contributes to observable behaviour: the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET access computes the filesystem record used as an argument to statvfs; the call to statvfs obtains filesystem statistics (observable I/O/system call) and its failure path returns OS_ERROR; the three assignments copy the statvfs results (with explicit casts via OSAL_SIZE_C/OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C) into the output structure that the caller receives; and the final return reports success. The cast macros are type conversions and can affect behaviour if removed, so they are not dead. There is no unreachable code in the function and no initialization mistaken for an assignment. The surrounding code (parameter checks and object lookup/release) ensures the output pointer is valid and the token is meaningful, so none of the executed operations here can be removed without changing program behaviour. Therefore no fragments need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
