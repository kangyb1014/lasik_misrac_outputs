  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TaskDelete_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskDelete_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;\n    void *                          retval;\n    int                             ret;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n    ** Try to delete the task\n    ** If this fails, not much recourse - the only potential cause of failure\n    ** to cancel here is that the thread ID is invalid because it already exited itself,\n    ** and if that is true there is nothing wrong - everything is OK to continue normally.\n    */\n    ret = pthread_cancel(impl->id);\n    if (ret != 0)\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_cancel: Failed on Task ID = %lu, err = %s\\n\",\n                 OS_ObjectIdToInteger(OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token)), strerror(ret));\n\n        /* fall through (will still return OS_SUCCESS) */\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * Note that \"pthread_cancel\" is a request - and successful return above\n         * only means that the cancellation request is pending.\n         *\n         * pthread_join() will wait until the thread has actually exited.\n         *\n         * This is important for CFE, as task deletion often occurs in\n         * conjunction with an application reload - which means the next\n         * call is likely to be OS_ModuleUnload().

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The only statement inside the if is a call to OS_DEBUG which, per the provided definitions, is defined as an empty macro. Therefore the debug call (and its strerror argument) is removed at preprocessing and no executed operation in that branch is redundant dead code. The meaningful operations are pthread_cancel (and pthread_join in the else), and the branch simply skips the join when cancel failed; this is intentional. Hence Rule 2.2 is not violated for this fragment."
