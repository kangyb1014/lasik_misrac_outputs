  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions were detected in the provided code. The constructs used are standard C and/or standard POSIX library usage, not compiler extensions: \n\n- pthread_cancel, pthread_join and pthread_t are POSIX API/library features, not language extensions. \n- The OS_DEBUG macro is a variadic macro (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) ) \u2014 variadic macros are part of standard C (since C99), not a compiler extension. \n- The use of static inline functions is standard C (C99 and later). \n- The other macros and expressions (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, address-of, array indexing, dereference, return statements, etc.) are standard C language constructs and do not use GCC/MSVC-specific extensions such as __attribute__, typeof, statement expressions, inline assembly, nested functions, or other vendor keywords. \n\nIf the target compiler explicitly documents any of the above standard features (for example, variadic macros or inline) as nonstandard or an extension for that compiler/version, then those specific features would need to be re-evaluated. Based on the code alone and common compiler documentation, there are no fragments to report under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
