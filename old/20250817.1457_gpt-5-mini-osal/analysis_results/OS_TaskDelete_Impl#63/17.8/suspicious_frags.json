  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies the parameter variable 'token' itself. The function prototype declares 'token' as 'const OS_object_token_t *token' (a pointer parameter), and throughout the body it is only: - dereferenced (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token)) to obtain the table entry, - passed by value to helper functions (OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token) and subsequently OS_ObjectIdToInteger(...)), or - used inside formatting calls for debug output. There are no assignments to 'token' (no token = ..., no token++, no reinitialization), nor any other operation that alters the pointer parameter. The pointer\u2019s pointee is only read (and even if it were written, the MISRA rule allows modification of the object pointed to), and calls to pthread_cancel/pthread_join operate on impl->id, not on the parameter. Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8."
