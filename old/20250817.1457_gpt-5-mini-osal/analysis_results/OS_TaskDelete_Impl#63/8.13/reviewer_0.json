For example, in OS_TaskDelete_Impl the call impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token) yields an OS_impl_task_internal_record_t * but the function only reads impl->id and does not modify the record; impl could therefore be declared const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t * (or the macro could return a pointer to const). The macro thus produces a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer is possible, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_TaskDelete_Impl_log_probe(const OS_object_token_t *token,\n                                        OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl,\n                                        const char *location,\n                                        int ret_code,\n                                        void *retval)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/507.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Log token pointer, object id (as integer), impl pointer, return code and retval pointer. */\n    fprintf(f, \"%s: token=%p object_id=%lu impl_ptr=%p ret=%d retval=%p\\n\",\n            location,\n            (const void *)token,\n            (unsigned long)OS_ObjectIdToInteger(OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token)),\n            (void *)impl,\n            ret_code,\n            retval);\n    /* Note that the actual field 'impl->id' is accessed by the implementation; log that fact. */\n    if (impl != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"%s: NOTE: implementation record is non-NULL; impl->id will be accessed (value not printed for portability)\\n\",\n                location);\n    }\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_TaskDelete_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl;\n    void *                          retval;\n    int                             ret;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token);\n\n    /* Probe after obtaining the implementation record */\n    OS_TaskDelete_Impl_log_probe(token, impl, \"after_get_impl\", -1, NULL);\n\n    /*\n    ** Try to delete the task\n    ** If this fails, not much recourse - the only potential cause of failure\n    ** to cancel here is that the thread ID is invalid because it already exited itself,\n    ** and if that is true there is nothing wrong - everything is OK to continue normally.\n    */\n    /* Probe immediately before calling pthread_cancel (impl->id will be accessed) */\n    OS_TaskDelete_Impl_log_probe(token, impl, \"before_pthread_cancel (about to access impl->id)\", -1, NULL);\n\n    ret = pthread_cancel(impl->id);\n\n    /* Probe after pthread_cancel returns */\n    OS_TaskDelete_Impl_log_probe(token, impl, \"after_pthread_cancel\", ret, NULL);\n\n    if (ret != 0)\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_cancel: Failed on Task ID = %lu, err = %s\\n\",\n                 OS_ObjectIdToInteger(OS_ObjectIdFromToken(token)), strerror(ret));\n\n        /* fall through (will still return OS_SUCCESS) */\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * Note that \"pthread_cancel\" is a request - and successful return above\n         * only means that the cancellation request is pending.\n         *\n         * pthread_join() will wait until the thread has actually exited.\n         *\n         * This is important for CFE, as task deletion often occurs in\n         * conjunction with an application reload - which means the next\n         * call is likely to be OS_ModuleUnload().

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the shown function the local pointer impl is only used for read access (impl->id) and is never used to modify the pointed-at record; therefore it can and should be declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl) to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET returning a mutable pointer is the source of the non-const type, but that does not excuse the local declaration: converting the returned T * to a const T * is allowed and appropriate here. The only reasons this would not be a violation are if the function actually modified the record (it does not), or if impl had to be passed to an API that requires a non-const pointer (not the case in the shown code). Suggested fixes: declare impl as const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl, or change the macro/API to provide a pointer-to-const where mutation is not intended."
