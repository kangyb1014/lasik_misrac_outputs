  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. In OS_TaskDelete_Impl the local variable impl is declared as a plain pointer (OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl) but the function only reads from the pointed object (impl->id passed to pthread_cancel/pthread_join) and never modifies *impl. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types when possible; here the pointer could and should be declared as const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *impl to reflect the read-only usage. The only caveat is if there is a project-specific reason (or the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro or other callers require a non-const pointer) that prevents making it const; absent such a reason, the report is correct."
