  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target function OS_CondVarLock_Impl and the related symbols. The function only calls pthread_mutex_lock and returns status codes; there are no calls to memcmp or any string comparison functions. The provided inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx (an index), and the table declaration OS_impl_condvar_table is an array \u2014 neither contains or implies use of memcmp or comparison of null-terminated strings. No other code or macros shown expand to memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
