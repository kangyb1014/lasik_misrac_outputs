  "explanation": "No unreachable code is present within this function. Reasoning: \n- The assignment impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is a normal expression statement; its result is used and control continues to the next statement. There is no code after it that is by construction unreachable. \n- The call status = pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut); executes and its return value is tested. Both outcomes of the test are handled: if (status != 0) returns OS_ERROR; otherwise execution continues to the final return OS_SUCCESS. Each branch ends with a return, but there is no code following those returns that would be unreachable. \n- There are no unconditional jumps, infinite loops, or code after an unconditional return in this function that would make any statement unreachable. \nNote: If the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to code that contains control-flow affecting constructs (e.g., an internal return, longjmp, or goto out of this function), that expansion is outside the scope of this function listing; such macro definition should be reviewed separately. Based solely on the visible function body, there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code)."
