  "explanation": "I examined OS_CondVarLock_Impl and the provided related definitions. The function only calls pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut) after obtaining impl via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, then returns OS_SUCCESS or OS_ERROR. There are no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), no direct pointer arithmetic or buffer copies involving character arrays, and no usages of string handling APIs in the shown code. The OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t contains pthread types only, and the array OS_impl_condvar_table is an array of those records \u2014 none of which involve string.h operations. Therefore, with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (use of <string.h> functions causing out-of-bounds access), there are no suspicious code fragments to investigate in the provided code."
