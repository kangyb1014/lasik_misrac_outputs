  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CondVarLock_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CondVarLock_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int                                status;\n    OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token);\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mut);\n    if (status != 0)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_CondVarLock_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t OS_impl_condvar_table[OS_MAX_CONDVARS]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_mutex_t mut;\n    pthread_cond_t  cv;\n} OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ntypedef struct\n{\n    pthread_mutex_t mut;\n    pthread_cond_t  cv;\n} OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment is a typedef that defines a type (no executed operations). It is referenced by OS_CondVarLock_Impl (pointer to OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t) and by the object table, so removing it would affect program behavior. Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated."
