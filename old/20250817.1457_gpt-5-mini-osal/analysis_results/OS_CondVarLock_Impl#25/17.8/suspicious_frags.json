  "explanation": "No code fragments in the function modify the function parameter itself. The following were examined and found safe with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8:\n\n- The use of *token in the macro invocation impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token); only dereferences the pointer to obtain the object for indexing; it does not assign to or otherwise modify the token pointer parameter.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) expands to (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]) which becomes &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))] when invoked. This takes the address of the object referred to by token (effectively token) and does not modify the pointer parameter or the object.\n- There are no assignments to token, no increments/decrements, and token is not passed to any function in a way that would modify the pointer itself. The only other operations access impl and impl->mut; these do not modify the parameter.\n\nGiven the above, there are no fragments that appear to violate the rule (i.e., no modifications of the pointer parameter or of the pointed-to object via a non-allowed mechanism)."
