  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The provided function contains no for statements or for-like constructs to which MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 would apply. A search of the code shows no 'for' tokens in the function body, no loop counters, and no loop control flags. The OS_DEBUG macro is defined as empty in the additional code, so it does not introduce any hidden for loops in this translation unit. External calls (dlsym, dlerror) are library functions and not part of the examined source; Rule 14.2 concerns for statements in the source under review (and the behaviour of any functions called from a for loop body, which is not applicable here because there is no for loop). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 14.2."
