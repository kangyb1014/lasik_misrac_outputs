Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Summary: The target function contains no for loops itself, so it cannot directly violate the MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' rule. However, to be conservative we must examine any called macros/functions that are expanded or executed in the body (they could contain a for loop or have side effects relevant to loop analysis). The following symbols are needed for that verification:\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - Reason: OS_DEBUG is used inside the function and is commonly a macro. The macro expansion could include control structures (including for loops) or modify global objects. To be certain the target function as written does not introduce or hide an ill-formed for loop, the exact definition/expansion of OS_DEBUG must be inspected.\n\n- dlerror\n  - Reason: dlerror() is called twice in the function. While it is a library function and will not insert a for loop into this function, its prototype/semantics should be checked to confirm it has no hidden side effects that would interact with any potential loop counters or control flags if a loop were later introduced or if macro expansions call into dlerror. This is a low-risk verification but included for completeness.\n\n- dlsym\n  - Reason: dlsym() is called and its return value is used. Like dlerror, it does not create loops in the caller, but its behavior/side effects should be known if one needed to reason about loop counters or objects modified by functions invoked from within a for loop.\n\nNote: There are no local or nested for statements in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl, so no further symbols (callers, other internal helpers, or type definitions) are required to determine that this function as shown does not violate the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule. The items above are only required to confirm that no called macro/function hides a problematic for loop or unexpected side effects."
