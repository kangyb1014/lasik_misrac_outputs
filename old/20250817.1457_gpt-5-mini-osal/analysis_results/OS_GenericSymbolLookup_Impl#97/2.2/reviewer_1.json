  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. If OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro (e.g. #define OS_DEBUG(...)) then the source line OS_DEBUG(...); expands to a null statement (an empty \u2018;\u2019). That expansion contains no executed \"operation\" in the sense intended by MISRA 2.2 \u2014 there is no side\u2011effecting code being executed whose removal would change program behaviour. Moreover the call is a conditional/instrumentation macro that in other build configurations may expand to real code; its presence in source is intentional and portable across configurations. MISRA 2.2 targets real dead operations (executable code that has no effect), not macro placeholders or null statements used for configurable instrumentation. For these reasons the scenario presented by agent A does not demonstrate a genuine MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 violation."
