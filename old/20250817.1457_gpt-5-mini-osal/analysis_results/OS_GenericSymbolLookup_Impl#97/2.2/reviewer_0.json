E.g. in OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl the call\n    OS_DEBUG(\"Error: %s: %s\\n\", SymbolName, dlError);\nexpands (with #define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)) to an empty statement (\u201c;\u201d), which is an executed no-op. Removing those OS_DEBUG calls would not change the functional behaviour of the program, so they constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Log(const char *event, const char *SymbolName, const void *Function, const char *dlError, long status)\n{\n    FILE *f = NULL;\n    time_t t = time(NULL);\n    struct tm tm_buf;\n    char timestr[64];\n\n    /* Ensure directory exists; ignore error if it already exists. */\n    (void)mkdir(\"/tmp/logs\", 0777);\n\n    f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/778.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging cannot be performed, silently return to avoid altering behavior. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Format time safely */\n    if (localtime_r(&t, &tm_buf) != NULL)\n    {\n        if (strftime(timestr, sizeof(timestr), \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", &tm_buf) == 0)\n        {\n            timestr[0] = '\\0';\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        timestr[0] = '\\0';\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"%s - EVENT=%s; SymbolName=%s; Function=%p; dlError=%s; status=%ld\\n\",\n            timestr,\n            (event != NULL) ? event : \"(null)\",\n            (SymbolName != NULL) ?

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids dead code defined as code that is executed and whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The OS_DEBUG calls in the snippet are diagnostic macros that either expand to real logging calls (in which case their removal changes observable behaviour) or expand to nothing (e.g. #define OS_DEBUG(...)) \u2014 in that latter case there is no runtime code generated (a null statement in source produces no instructions), so there is no executed no-op to classify as \"dead code\" under the rule. Moreover, even if the macro were empty in one build, removing the source lines could change timing or other externally-observable behaviour in an embedded system; MISRA explicitly notes timing can affect behaviour. The supplied test/log evidence does not demonstrate that these lines are executed no-ops (the logging wrapper produced no output, which can be due to the function not being exercised, environment restrictions, or the macro being compiled out). For these reasons the claim that OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl violates MISRA Rule 2.2 is not supported."
