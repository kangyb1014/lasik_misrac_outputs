  "explanation": "dlsym: Need the actual declaration/definition (or macro expansion) to confirm it does not modify the caller's parameter variables. In standard POSIX it takes its arguments by value (void *handle, const char *name) so it cannot assign to the caller's pointer parameters, but if dlsym is a macro or wrapped implementation it could expand to code that modifies local parameter variables \u2014 the definition rules this out.\ndlerror: Although dlerror takes no arguments, its definition or macro expansion must be checked to ensure it does not contain side-effecting code that could assign to local parameter variables (unlikely but possible if implemented as a macro).\nOS_DEBUG: Often a macro; its expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not perform assignments to the function parameters (for example a bizarre debug macro that writes into caller-named identifiers). The calls OS_DEBUG(\"...\", SymbolName, dlError) use parameter names and a macro could conceivably reference/modify them.\ncpuaddr (typedef): Need the typedef to confirm the semantics of cpuaddr and cpuaddr *SymbolAddress. In particular confirm that cpuaddr is an integer type (not some pointer type) so that the statement *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function modifies the pointed-to object (allowed by the MISRA rule) rather than modifying the pointer parameter itself. This ensures the assignment is to the object referenced, not to the pointer parameter variable."
