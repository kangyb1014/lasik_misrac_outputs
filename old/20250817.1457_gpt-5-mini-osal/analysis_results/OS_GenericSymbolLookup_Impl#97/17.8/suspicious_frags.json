  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in a way that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Specifically:\n- The only write involving a pointer parameter is the statement \"*SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function;\" \u2014 this modifies the object pointed to by SymbolAddress, which the rule explicitly allows. The pointer variable SymbolAddress itself is not reassigned.\n- dl_handle is only passed to dlsym() and is not assigned to or altered anywhere in the function.\n- SymbolName is declared as const char * and is only used as a read-only argument (passed to dlsym and OS_DEBUG); it is not modified.\n- All other assignments affect local variables (Function, dlError, status) and not any parameter variables.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in this function."
