  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code was identified in the supplied code. Reasoning:\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: All branches (dlError != NULL, Function == NULL, else) are determined by run-time results of dlerror()/dlsym() and are therefore potentially reachable; there are no constant expressions that make a branch impossible. The function contains no statements after an unconditional return that would be unreachable.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Impl: The decision to iterate module-local symbols is based on the run-time return value of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl; the loop body is reachable when the iterator yields items. There are no constant conditions rendering the loop or its body unreachable.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl and callers: These functions simply pass results through; there are no unreachable statements or branches caused by compile-time constants.\n\n- Use of macros: OS_DEBUG is defined empty, but that merely removes logging statements at preprocessing time and does not create unreachable code (it does not introduce constant conditions or dead code hidden behind constant false macros). The remaining code around those macros remains reachable at run-time.\n\n- No other constructs (e.g., if (0), return followed by executable statements, or unconditional infinite loops that make subsequent code unreachable) were present in the provided snippets.\n\nTherefore, there are no code fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) in the provided source. If you want, I can also check for other MISRA rules or re-check if additional source files or different macro definitions are in effect that might create unreachable code (e.g., different definitions of OS_DEBUG or compile-time flags)."
