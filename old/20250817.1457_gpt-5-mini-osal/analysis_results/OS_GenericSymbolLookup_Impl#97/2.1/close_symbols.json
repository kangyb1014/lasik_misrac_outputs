  "explanation": "dlerror: The return value of dlerror() (NULL vs non-NULL) controls the first if-branch. Its semantics (and whether it can never/always be NULL for this build) are needed to determine if any branch is unreachable.\n\ndlsym: The value returned by dlsym() (Function == NULL or not) controls the else-if branch. Knowledge of dlsym() behavior is required to assess reachability of those branches.\n\nOS_DEBUG: This macro/function is invoked inside the conditional branches. Its definition must be inspected because it could contain control-flow effects (e.g. return, goto, longjmp, abort) which would make later statements in the function unreachable.\n\nOS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: These symbols set the status value returned by the function. While they are typically constants, if they are macros/functions with side effects or control-flow, that could affect reachability; their definitions are required to rule that out.\n\ncpuaddr: The cast to (cpuaddr) and the write *SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)Function must be type-correct and not expand to code with side effects; the cpuaddr typedef/macro should be checked to ensure it does not introduce hidden control flow that could affect reachability.\n\nOS_SymbolLookup_Impl and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl: These are the direct callers of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl. To determine whether the function itself is reachable in the project (and thus whether the entire function could be dead/unreachable code), the callers' definitions and whether they are reachable must be inspected.\n\nOS_SymbolLookup and OS_ModuleSymbolLookup: These higher-level callers (referenced in the static call graph) are needed to continue the reachability analysis upward (to public APIs or entry points). If none of these call chains are reachable from any program entry point, the function could be considered unreachable.\n\nTogether, these symbols provide the necessary behavioral and call-chain information to determine whether any statements/branches inside OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl (or the function as a whole) are unreachable under the MISRA C rule."
