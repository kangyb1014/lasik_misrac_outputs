  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions were identified in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no uses of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_..., __extension__, typeof, inline assembly (asm), statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, computed gotos, labels-as-values, or nonstandard integer types like __int128.\n- The OS_DEBUG macro uses the standard C99 variadic macro token __VA_ARGS__, which is a standard language feature, not a compiler extension.\n- The use of POSIX library calls (dlsym, dlerror) are library/API calls, not language extensions and therefore not in scope for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 reporting.\n- The cast from a void* to cpuaddr (uintptr_t) is an implementation-defined conversion but is not a compiler language extension; it is standard C behavior and therefore not reported under Rule 1.2.\n- Typedefs shown (int32_t, uintptr_t) are standard stdint types, not extensions.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that need investigation for use of compiler language extensions as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
