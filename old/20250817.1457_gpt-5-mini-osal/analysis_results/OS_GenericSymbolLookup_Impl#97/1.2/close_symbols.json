  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions/declarations of the symbols it uses (macros/types/functions) because those definitions can contain extensions (attributes, compiler built-ins, nonstandard keywords, statement-expressions, inline asm, GCC/Clang __attribute__ or __builtin_*, etc.). Specifically:\n\n- cpuaddr: This typedef is central because the function casts a void* to cpuaddr and assigns it to *SymbolAddress. The cpuaddr typedef may be an implementation-specific integer type or use compiler extensions (e.g., __int128, __attribute__, packed/unaligned types). You must inspect its definition to see if a language extension is used.\n\n- int32: The function return type is int32; this is typically a typedef and its definition may use compiler-specific constructs. Verify its typedef to rule out extensions.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: This macro is used for error reporting and may expand to code that uses extensions (variadic-macro syntax, statement-expressions ({ ... }), compiler-specific logging macros, attributes, inline asm, or builtin functions). Inspect its definition to ensure it is standard C.\n\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: These symbolic constants (macros or enum members) might be defined using compiler-specific constructs (e.g., assigned via __extension__ expressions, attributes, or unusual integer-width types). Check their definitions.\n\n- dlsym: The call to dlsym and the subsequent cast rely on the dlsym declaration. Platform headers sometimes decorate dlsym with nonstandard attributes or use macros that map to compiler-specific names. Inspect the dlsym prototype/definition in the included headers to ensure no extensions are introduced.\n\n- dlerror: dlerror() is called to check runtime errors; its declaration or any macros around it may include compiler-specific attributes or extensions. Verify its declaration.\n\nInspecting these symbols (type definitions and macros/declarations) is sufficient to determine whether the target function itself uses any language extensions indirectly via casts, macros, or called/decorated declarations. Other local identifiers (e.g., Function, dlError, status) are plain local variables and need no further inspection."
