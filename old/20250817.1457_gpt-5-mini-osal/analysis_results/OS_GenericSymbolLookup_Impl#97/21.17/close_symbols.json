  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C rule about use of <string.h> functions (no out-of-bounds accesses of objects referenced by pointer parameters) you must be able to reason about any string operations or string-buffer origins reachable from the target function. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- dlerror\n  - dlerror() returns a char* error string and may use/return internal buffers. To determine whether any string functions (e.g., strlen, strcpy used internally by dlerror or by code that consumes its result) can read past object bounds you must inspect the dlerror implementation, return value lifetime, and whether the returned pointer is NUL-terminated or points into a buffer that could be overrun.\n\n- dlsym\n  - dlsym() takes SymbolName (const char*) and may expect a NUL-terminated string; its implementation could call string routines or otherwise access the SymbolName buffer. You need the dlsym prototype/semantics and implementation details to ensure it does not read beyond the provided SymbolName object.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - OS_DEBUG is used with \"%s\" to print SymbolName and dlError. The debug/log routine may call printf, strlen, or other string.h functions. To ensure no out-of-bounds string accesses occur when printing these pointers, inspect how OS_DEBUG consumes its string arguments and whether it copies or scans them.\n\n- OS_SymbolLookup_Impl (caller)\n  - This caller passes SymbolName and SymbolAddress into OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl. To know whether SymbolName (and the address passed for SymbolAddress) is a valid, NUL-terminated, in-bounds buffer you must examine the caller\u2019s behavior: how it constructs/obtains SymbolName and whether it ensures termination and object bounds before calling the generic lookup.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl (caller)\n  - Another direct caller that forwards a name/handle into the target function. You must inspect how this function obtains or composes the SymbolName (for example, from module metadata or token lookups) to ensure it is a properly sized, NUL-terminated buffer and not susceptible to string.h-related out-of-bounds reads by dlsym/OS_DEBUG.\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken\n  - This is invoked by OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl and may be involved in producing the module name or symbol name buffers. If it constructs or copies strings (e.g., using strcpy/strncpy/strlen), you must review it to ensure no out-of-bounds accesses occur upstream of the target function.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive and OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy\n  - These are called by OS_SymbolLookup_Impl and may participate in creating or iterating over object names passed as SymbolName. Their implementations may call string.h routines or produce buffers whose bounds/termination must be validated.\n\n- cpuaddr (typedef / definition)\n  - The function casts the void* result of dlsym into cpuaddr and writes to *SymbolAddress. While not a <string.h> symbol, the type/size of cpuaddr and the pointer conversion matter to determine if any pointer arithmetic or truncation could indirectly lead to invalid pointer usages when strings are later accessed. Also you need to confirm the caller provides a valid pointer for SymbolAddress (see the callers above).\n\nIn short: to judge whether any string.h functions could read/write past object bounds you must examine the implementations/prototypes where strings originate (callers and helper functions), and the functions that consume or produce string data (dlsym, dlerror, OS_DEBUG). The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to trace string origins, lifetimes, and any use of standard string routines reachable from OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl."
