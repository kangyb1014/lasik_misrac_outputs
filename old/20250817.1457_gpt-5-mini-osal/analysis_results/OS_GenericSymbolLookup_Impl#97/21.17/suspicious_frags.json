  "explanation": "No occurrences of the string.h functions named by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code fragments. Specific notes:\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl: uses dlerror() and dlsym(), and assigns/casts the returned void* to cpuaddr. These are not string.h functions and do not perform string buffer accesses governed by Rule 21.17.\n- The OS_DEBUG invocations include a \"%s\" format and SymbolName, but the provided definition (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)) expands to nothing, so there is no runtime string handling in the shown code. Even if OS_DEBUG were to expand to a logging function, that would be I/O (printf-family), not functions from <string.h> listed in Rule 21.17.\n- Other provided helper functions (OS_SymbolLookup_Impl, OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl, iterator helpers) do not call any of the listed string.h functions.\n\nBecause none of the specified string.h functions are used in the supplied code, there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. If there are other project files where OS_DEBUG is defined to call string-handling routines or where the listed string.h functions are used, those files should be examined separately."
