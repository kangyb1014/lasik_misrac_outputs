Since the code does not modify the pointed-to object, MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires the pointer to be const-qualified (e.g., const void *Function). Thus the assignment 'Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);' demonstrates a violation.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\ntypedef int32_t int32;\ntypedef uintptr_t cpuaddr;\nstatic const int32 OS_IMPL_ERROR  = -1;\nstatic const int32 OS_IMPL_SUCCESS = 0;\nstatic void OS_DEBUG(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    va_list ap;\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/779.txt\", \"a\");\n\n    if (fp != NULL)\n    {\n        va_start(ap, fmt);\n        vfprintf(fp, fmt, ap);\n        va_end(ap);\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n}\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    va_list ap;\n    FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/779.txt\", \"a\");\n\n    if (fp == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If the probe log cannot be opened, attempt nothing further. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(fp, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    /* Ensure the line is flushed for immediate evidence collection. */\n    fflush(fp);\n    fclose(fp);\n}\n\nint32 OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(void *dl_handle, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    const char *dlError; /*  Pointer to error string   */\n    void *      Function;\n    int32       status;\n\n    status = OS_IMPL_ERROR;\n\n    /* Log entry and input state */\n    probe_log(\"ENTER: OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl dl_handle=%p SymbolName=%s\\n\",\n              dl_handle,\n              (SymbolName != NULL) ?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is a \u2018should\u2019 guideline (prefer pointers to const-qualified targets when possible), but the claim that this specific code violates it is unfounded. The pointer Function is storing the result of the POSIX dlsym() API which is declared to return void *; using a non-const void * matches the called API. The code does not dereference or modify the pointed-to object, but the value returned by dlsym may represent either a function or object address and is treated opaquely (cast to an integer cpuaddr). Changing the local declaration to const void * would be technically possible, but is not required and could be misleading in the context of dynamic symbol lookups and subsequent conversions/calls. In short, the reported violation is not correct: this use is consistent with the dlsym API and does not constitute a clear MISRA 8.13 breach in this context."
