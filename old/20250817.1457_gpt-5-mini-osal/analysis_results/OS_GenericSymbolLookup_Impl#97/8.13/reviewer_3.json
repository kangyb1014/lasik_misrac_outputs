  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The local variable \"Function\" is declared as \"void *Function\" but it is only used to hold the result of dlsym(), compared against NULL, printed, and then converted to an integer (cpuaddr) and stored. It is never used to modify the object it points to. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 a pointer should be to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so declaring it as \"const void *Function\" would satisfy the rule. Assigning the void * result of dlsym() to a const void * is allowed without a cast, and the subsequent cast to cpuaddr does not require modification of the pointee. If there were a later need to call an API that takes a non-const void * or to write through the pointer, then const would be inappropriate, but in this function there is no such use, so the reported violation is valid."
