  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: dlError is declared as const char * which already satisfies pointing to a const-qualified type; SymbolName is const char * (correct for input string); the call to dlerror() and assignment to dlError are consistent with dlerror() returning a non-const char * being stored in a const-qualified pointer (which is allowed and intentional for read-only use); the status variable, debug prints, and the control-flow checks do not involve pointer types that could/should be const-qualified. The out-parameter that receives the symbol address must be writable (non-const) because the function stores the result into it, so it is not a candidate for const qualification."
