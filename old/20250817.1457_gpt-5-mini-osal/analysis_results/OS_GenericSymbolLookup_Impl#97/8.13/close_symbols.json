  "explanation": "- dlerror: Needed to confirm its return type is char * (non-const) vs const char *. The function assigns dlerror() result to a local const char * (dlError). Whether this is adding const or discarding constness matters for the MISRA rule analysis.\\n- dlsym: Needed to confirm its return type (usually void *) so we can determine whether any const qualifiers are lost/added when assigning to Function (void *) and later converting to cpuaddr. If an implementation returned const void * that would affect the const-correctness.\\n- cpuaddr: The typedef/definition of cpuaddr (integer type, pointer-sized integer, or pointer type) is required to determine whether casting/converting the result of dlsym to cpuaddr and storing via SymbolAddress (cpuaddr *) is compatible with const-qualification rules and whether SymbolAddress could/should be a pointer-to-const.\\n- OS_DEBUG: Prototype or macro signature is required to check the parameter types (e.g., const char *) to ensure passing SymbolName (const char *) and dlError (const char *) is const-correct and does not hide any const-qualification issues.\\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: Definitions are included to fully understand the status variable type and usage (though they do not directly affect pointer constness, they complete the context of the function's contract).\\nThese symbols provide the type/prototype information needed to decide if any pointer is being assigned to or from a non-const pointer where a const-qualified pointer would be appropriate under the MISRA rule."
