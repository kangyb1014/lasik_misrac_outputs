  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe local variable 'Function' is declared as 'void *Function;' but is only used to hold the result of dlsym() and never used to modify the pointed-to object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type when possible (e.g. 'const void *Function;'). Declaring it non-const therefore violates the rule.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/779.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(void *dl_handle, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    const char *dlError; /*  Pointer to error string   */\n    void *      Function;\n    int32       status;\n\n    status = OS_ERROR;\n\n    /*\n     * call dlerror() to clear any prior error that might have occurred.\n     */\n    dlerror();\n    Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);\n    dlError  = dlerror();\n\n    /*\n     * For the POSIX DL implementation, if the symbol does not exist\n     * then dlerror() is supposed to return non-null.
