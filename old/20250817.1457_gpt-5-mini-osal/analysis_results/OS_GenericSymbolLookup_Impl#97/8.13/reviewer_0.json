  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers should be to const-qualified types when they are used only for reading. In the body of OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl the dl_handle parameter is not modified by the function itself, so at first glance it looks like it could be const-qualified. However dl_handle is passed directly to dlsym(), whose POSIX prototype expects a plain void * handle. Changing the parameter here to const void * would either (a) require casting away const when calling dlsym (which introduces qualifier-discarding casts and would itself conflict with other MISRA rules or require a documented deviation), or (b) require changing the surrounding interfaces to use const, which may not be possible or desirable to maintain API compatibility. Given those constraints, keeping dl_handle as void * is a defensible design choice and not necessarily a MISRA 8.13 violation in context. SymbolAddress is an output parameter and must remain non-const, and SymbolName is already const-qualified as noted. Therefore the agent A report that this code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is not correct as a clear-cut violation (it is at most a stylistic observation that would need an API-level change or a justified deviation)."
