  "explanation": "dlerror - Target calls dlerror() to obtain an error string; inspect its implementation (usually in libdl/libc) to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\ndlsym - Target calls dlsym(); inspect its implementation in libdl/libc to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings (indirect use would count toward a violation if occurring during this function's execution).\n\nOS_DEBUG - Macro or function used for logging error messages. Its expansion/implementation may perform string operations; check it does not use memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nOS_SUCCESS - Macro/constant used to set status on success. Include to resolve any conditional logic or macros that might hide string comparisons (typically harmless but required to fully understand status paths).\n\nOS_ERROR - Macro/constant used to initialize status. Same rationale as OS_SUCCESS (resolve macros that could contain code).\n\ncpuaddr (typedef) - The target writes the Function pointer into a cpuaddr; examine typedef/related conversion macros to ensure no hidden string comparisons occur during conversion or assignment.\n\nint32 (typedef) - Type of the return/status variable; include to resolve any platform-specific macros or inline functions tied to this type that could perform string comparisons.\n\nmemcmp (standard library function) - The MISRA rule under investigation. Include to search implementations of the above symbols (dlerror, dlsym, OS_DEBUG, etc.) for any use of memcmp when comparing null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nNote: The target function itself has no direct callees, so only the symbols it references (and the standard memcmp) need to be examined to determine if memcmp is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings in the execution of this function."
