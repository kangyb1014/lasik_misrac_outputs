  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if UtMessage contains dead code:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText\n  - UtMessage's only observable effect is the call to UT_BSP_DoText; to decide whether the call (and therefore the preceding vsnprintf) is dead we must examine UT_BSP_DoText's body to see whether it performs any observable side-effects (I/O, state changes, shutdown, synchronization, etc.) or is a no-op.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock\n  - Called by UT_BSP_DoText per the static call graph. If DoText acquires locks, that is an observable synchronization side-effect; removing the call could change timing/behaviour in a multithreaded/interrupt context.\n\n- UT_BSP_Unlock\n  - Paired with UT_BSP_Lock; needed to understand the synchronization behaviour and whether removing DoText affects locking/unlocking (observable behaviour/timing).\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl\n  - DoText delegates actual output to this implementation. If it writes to hardware/console/device or performs other I/O, the call is observable; its implementation determines whether DoText is meaningful or effectively a no-op.\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl\n  - Called by DoText according to the call graph; changing console mode is an observable side-effect. Need to inspect to know whether DoText affects global device state.\n\n- OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl\n  - If DoText can invoke shutdown behavior for certain message types, that is a critical observable side-effect. Presence of shutdown makes the call non-dead.\n\n- UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev\n  - Used by DoText to format messages (per call graph). Even if it only returns a string, that may affect output content; examine to determine if formatting has observable effects beyond local data.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (definition, including Buf.Text)\n  - UtMessage uses a local buffer of this type and takes sizeof(Buf.Text). The buffer's definition reveals size and any special attributes (volatile, placed in mapped memory, etc.) that could make the vsnprintf write observable. If Buf.Text is ordinary stack memory and not volatile, then writes to it are only observable via DoText; if it maps to special memory/side-effectful region, the vsnprintf call itself could be observable.\n\n- vsnprintf (implementation / libc behaviour)\n  - Standard library routines can have observable side-effects (e.g., setting errno, using locale/state). Confirm whether the target runtime's vsnprintf has any observable side-effects beyond writing Buf.Text; if none, and DoText is a no-op, the vsnprintf call would be dead.\n\n- build-time configuration or weak/override definitions for UT_BSP_DoText / OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl\n  - In embedded projects these BSP functions are often provided as weak stubs or controlled by compile-time flags (console enabled/disabled). To decide if the call is effectively dead in the built system you must check configuration and whether UT_BSP_DoText/console output are linked to active implementations or to empty stubs.\n\nTogether, these symbols let the analyst determine whether the writes performed by vsnprintf and the call to UT_BSP_DoText produce any externally observable behaviour (I/O, state change, shutdown, synchronization, timing) \u2014 if they do, the code is not dead; if not (and no configuration causes side-effects), the operations could be considered dead code under the MISRA rule."
