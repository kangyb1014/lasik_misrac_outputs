Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for analysing MISRA C \"for loop shall be well\u2011formed\" with respect to UtMessage:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: UtMessage directly calls this function; the MISRA text says the behaviour of the for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. Any for loops inside UT_BSP_DoText must be checked for well\u2011formedness.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev, OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl, UT_BSP_Unlock, OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: These are the transitive callees of UT_BSP_DoText (listed in the static call graph). Because any for loop in UT_BSP_DoText\u2019s callees also contributes to the observable behaviour of UtMessage, each of these functions must be inspected for for\u2011statements that could violate the rule.\n\n- vsnprintf: UtMessage calls the library function vsnprintf. Although it is a library routine, it is part of the observable behaviour of UtMessage; if the implementation contains for loops (or macros expanding to for loops), they must be checked for MISRA compliance or otherwise argued out\u2011of\u2011scope.\n\n- UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t: This local type defines Buf and its Text member (the buffer passed to vsnprintf). The type/definition should be checked to ensure there are no hidden macros, inline functions, or initializer code that contain for loops which would be executed as part of UtMessage.\n\n- va_start/va_end (va_list): The variadic macros and va_list usage are invoked in UtMessage. If any implementation\u2011specific macros or wrappers expand to code containing for loops, they must be examined (or documented as out\u2011of\u2011scope) for MISRA compliance.\n\nConcise rationale: MISRA requires analysing for\u2011loops in the function body and in any called functions (direct and indirect). The list therefore includes the direct callee(s), their transitive callees, and any implementation/type/macros used by UtMessage that could introduce for statements into its behaviour."
