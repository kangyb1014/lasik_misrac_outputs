  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the shown code. Specifically:\n- MessageType (uint8) is only used as a value argument to UT_BSP_DoText; there is no assignment to MessageType.\n- File (const char *) is not used or assigned anywhere in the function; the pointer is neither reassigned nor its pointee modified.\n- Line (uint32) is not used or assigned; the parameter is not modified.\n- Spec (const char *) is passed to vsnprintf as a format string; the pointer itself is not reassigned and its pointee (the format string) is not modified by this call.\n- The variadic handling (va_list va, va_start, va_end) operates on the local va variable; it does not modify any of the formal parameters.\n- Buf.Text is a local buffer and is the object being written by vsnprintf; modifying a local object does not violate Rule 17.8 (which concerns function parameters).\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
