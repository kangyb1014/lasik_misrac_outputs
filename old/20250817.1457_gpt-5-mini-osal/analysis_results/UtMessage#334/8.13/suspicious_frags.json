  "explanation": "The function parameters 'const char *File' and 'const char *Spec' are already const-qualified, so they do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. MessageType and Line are non-pointer scalar parameters and are not relevant to pointer const-qualification. The only pointer-like entities in this snippet that require review are the local buffer declaration/uses and the va_list: Buf (and its member Text) is used as a modifiable character buffer and is passed to external functions; va_list may be an underlying pointer type on some platforms. The listed fragments cover all places in this function where non-const pointer objects are declared or passed \u2014 there are no other pointer declarations in the provided code that would need investigation for Rule 8.13."
