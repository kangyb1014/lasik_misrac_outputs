  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: Buf is declared as an object of type UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t, not as a pointer, so Rule 8.13 (about pointer types being const-qualified when possible) is not violated here. (A possible violation scenario would be if UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t were a typedef for a pointer type \u2014 e.g. typedef char *UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t; \u2014 in which case Buf would be a pointer to a non-const-qualified type and could violate Rule 8.13 unless the pointed-to type is made const-qualified when appropriate.)"
