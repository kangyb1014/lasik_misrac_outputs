  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments (function signature, local declarations: UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t Buf; va_list va; and the va_start/va_end calls) do not invoke any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and therefore are not directly relevant to buffer-overrun concerns governed by that rule. The va_list/va_start/va_end usage relates to variadic argument handling (stdarg.h), not string.h operations. Declarations alone do not perform memory accesses that could violate the rule. The two reported lines are the only places in the snippet where a buffer is written/read via library calls and thus need investigation (e.g. to verify Buf.Text is an actual array of sufficient size and that the buffer size argument is correct)."
