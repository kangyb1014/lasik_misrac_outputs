  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n\nReasons (why other fragments do not need investigation):\n- The function parameter is already a pointer to const: const OS_object_token_t *token \u2014 this matches the rule.\n- The use of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token) ultimately passes &(*token) to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken which accepts a const OS_object_token_t *; there is no loss of const-qualification or unsafe conversion here.\n- The impl variable is a pointer to OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t and points into the mutable OS_impl_condvar_table array. It cannot be const-qualified because the code obtains addresses of impl->cv and impl->mut and passes them to pthread_cond_destroy / pthread_mutex_destroy, which require pointers to non-const objects (the operations mutate/destroy those objects). Making impl a pointer-to-const would prevent these required operations.\n- The addresses &impl->cv and &impl->mut are pointers to the actual pthread types; these must remain non-const to satisfy the pthread API, so they are not candidates for const-qualification.\n\nGiven the above, there are no pointers in this function that could be more const-qualified without breaking required behavior or API contracts, so no fragments need further investigation for Rule 8.13."
