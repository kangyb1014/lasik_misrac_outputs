  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter. The parameter is declared as a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token), so neither the pointer itself nor the pointed-to object is modified in this function. The only use of token is in impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token); the macro expands to take the address of the token expression (&(tok)), and with tok == *token this becomes &(*token) which is equivalent to token (a read-only use). OS_ObjectIndexFromToken accepts a const pointer and only reads token->obj_idx. There are no assignments to token (no \"token = ...\"), no operations that alter *token, and the calls to pthread_cond_destroy/pthread_mutex_destroy operate on impl members, not on the token parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
