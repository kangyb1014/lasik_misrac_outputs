  "explanation": "I found no uses of any string handling functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) in the provided function OS_CondVarDelete_Impl or in the related definitions. The code only calls pthread_cond_destroy and pthread_mutex_destroy and uses the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro to index an array of OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t, which contains pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t members (no character buffers or string operations). The OS_ObjectIndexFromToken inline simply returns token->obj_idx and does not perform any string handling. Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17; no string.h function calls or string-pointer-based accesses exist in the supplied code. (Note: general bounds checking of the array index is a separate concern but is not related to Rule 21.17, which specifically targets string.h functions.)"
