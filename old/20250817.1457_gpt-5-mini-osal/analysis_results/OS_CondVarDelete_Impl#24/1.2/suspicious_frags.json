  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided function. The code only uses:\n- Standard C syntax (types, pointers, function calls, if statements, return).\n- typedef-like names (int32, OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t) which are ordinary user-defined types, not language extensions.\n- A macro invocation (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET), which is a preprocessor feature of standard C, not a compiler language extension in itself.\n- POSIX pthread API calls (pthread_cond_destroy, pthread_mutex_destroy), which are library/system calls, not compiler language extensions.\n\nThere are no occurrences of documented compiler extensions such as identifiers beginning with __ for compiler intrinsics, __attribute__, __asm__, typeof (nonstandard), statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, inline assembler, __builtin_... functions, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
