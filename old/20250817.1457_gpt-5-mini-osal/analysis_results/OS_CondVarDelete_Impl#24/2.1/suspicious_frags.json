  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Rationale: \n- There are no statements placed after an unconditional return; the single return at the end is reachable. \n- The two if-statements test the runtime return value of pthread_cond_destroy and pthread_mutex_destroy (status != 0); these depend on the OS/thread library at runtime and thus their bodies are potentially reachable. \n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an index lookup using OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok)), where OS_ObjectIndexFromToken reads token->obj_idx; this depends on the runtime token value (passed as *token), so the table access is not a compile-time constant that would make code unreachable. \n- There are no constant boolean expressions, unconditional goto/branching that would make subsequent code unreachable, and no dead labels or unused code blocks in the shown function. \nGiven the provided definitions and the absence of any always-true/always-false compile-time conditions or unreachable control-flow constructs in the excerpt, there is no code here that needs investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
