  "explanation": "You must know which called functions can alter control flow or be classified as non\u2011returning to decide if parts of UtPrintx become unreachable. Explanations:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: Direct callee at the end of the loop body. If UT_BSP_DoText is annotated or implemented as 'noreturn' (calls exit/longjmp/shutdown) then subsequent iterations of the while loop and any code after the call would be unreachable. The analysis must inspect UT_BSP_DoText's behavior/attributes.\n\n- OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: Shown in the static call graph as a callee of UT_BSP_DoText. If this implementation (or any callee of UT_BSP_DoText) does a non\u2011returning shutdown, it makes code after UT_BSP_DoText unreachable. You need its implementation/attributes to determine reachability.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock and UT_BSP_Unlock: Also callees of UT_BSP_DoText. If they perform control\u2011flow altering operations (longjmp, terminate, blocking forever) they can affect reachability. At minimum, you must know they are normal returning functions to rule out unreachable code resulting from their behavior.\n\n- snprintf, sprintf, strlen: Standard library functions used to build the OutputLine. Although these normally return and don\u2019t change control flow, they could be replaced/implemented in the project with wrappers or macros that are non\u2011returning or have side effects. The checker must confirm their signatures/attributes (returning vs non\u2011returning) to be certain no statements become unreachable because a formatting call never returns.\n\nIn short: confirm whether any of the above functions (direct callees or their callees) are non\u2011returning or perform control transfers (exit/longjmp/abort/terminate). If all are normal returning functions, there is no unreachable code in UtPrintx; if any are non\u2011returning, the loop continuation and later statements may be unreachable and require further inspection."
