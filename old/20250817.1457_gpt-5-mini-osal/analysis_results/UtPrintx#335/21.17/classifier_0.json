  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: OutputLine is a local array of 80 bytes and was populated with snprintf(OutputLine, sizeof(OutputLine), ...), which guarantees NUL-termination when sizeof(OutputLine) > 0. Therefore strlen(OutputLine) will not access beyond the bounds of OutputLine. (Hypothetical violating scenario: if OutputLine were not NUL-terminated\u2014e.g. size passed as 0 or prior writes omitted the terminator\u2014then strlen could read past the buffer and violate Rule 21.17.)"
