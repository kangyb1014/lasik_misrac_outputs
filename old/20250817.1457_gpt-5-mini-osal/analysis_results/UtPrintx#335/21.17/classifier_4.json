  "scenario": "Not directly violated by the single statement OutPtr += 3. strlen(OutputLine) is called earlier and is safe because snprintf(OutputLine, sizeof(OutputLine), ...) guarantees null-termination. However the code uses sprintf(OutPtr, ...) (no bounds) and then advances OutPtr by 3 without bounds checks. If OutputLine does not have enough remaining space (e.g. initial snprintf produced a long prefix or Length allows many iterations so that a later sprintf would need 5 bytes but fewer remain), the subsequent sprintf can overflow OutputLine; that overflow could then cause later uses of string-handling functions (e.g. strlen or other <string.h> routines) to access beyond object bounds. In summary: the fragment itself does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, but the surrounding use of unbounded sprintf and unguarded OutPtr += 3 creates a realistic scenario that can lead to a Rule 21.17 violation if the buffer becomes too small."
