  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not directly invoke the <string.h> string-handling functions listed by MISRA Rule 21.17 and therefore do not need separate investigation for that rule: variable declarations and initializations (uint32 i, j; const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory; char OutputLine[80]; char *OutPtr;) are simple definitions and do not perform string operations; the loop control (for (j = 0; j < 16 && i < Length; j++, i++)) enforces a bound on accesses to Byte_ptr[i], so those byte reads are guarded by i < Length; the call to UT_BSP_DoText merely consumes the prepared OutputLine (any issues with that string originate from the string-manipulation lines already listed). Therefore only the listed lines that perform formatting/length computations and pointer increments that affect the OutputLine buffer need investigation for potential out-of-bounds string accesses."
