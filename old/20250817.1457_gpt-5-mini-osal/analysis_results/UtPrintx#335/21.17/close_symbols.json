  "explanation": "snprintf: Required to know its truncation and NUL-termination guarantees (C99/C11 behavior). The safety of using strlen(OutputLine) and subsequent writes depends on snprintf always producing a NUL when size>0 and how many characters it writes (return value semantics).\n\nsprintf: Required because it is used to append hex bytes into OutputLine at OutPtr. sprintf does not limit the number of bytes written and always writes a terminating NUL; this must be considered to determine whether the call can write beyond the remaining space in OutputLine.\n\nstrlen: Required to know that it scans until a NUL byte and therefore its use is safe only if the buffer written by snprintf is NUL-terminated. Also needed to know the value it returns to position OutPtr.\n\nprintf-format semantics for \"%16lx: \": Required to determine how many characters snprintf can produce for the address header (minimum field width, possible additional digits if unsigned long is wider than expected), which affects how much of OutputLine is consumed by the header.\n\nprintf-format semantics for \"%02X  \": Required to determine exactly how many visible characters each sprintf call will produce for a byte (and therefore how many bytes sprintf actually writes including the terminating NUL). The code advances OutPtr by 3 per byte \u2014 the exact characters produced determine whether that pointer arithmetic is correct or leads to overlapping writes/out-of-bounds.\n\nsizeof(OutputLine) (80) / char size: The buffer size is the limit for writes; include it explicitly so the analyzer can compare total possible written bytes against available space.\n\nuint32 / uint8: Required to know widths of Length, i, j and Byte_ptr element size to compute loop bounds and indexing, and to reason about iterations (16 per line, total lines) and whether Length/indices can cause indexing beyond the provided Memory object.\n\nsizeof(unsigned long) and sizeof(void *): Required because the number of characters produced by \"%16lx\" depends on the width and printed representation of (unsigned long) &Byte_ptr[i]; if unsigned long is larger than assumed, the header can be wider and reduce remaining space.\n\nUT_BSP_DoText prototype/contract: Required to confirm whether UT_BSP_DoText expects a NUL-terminated C string and whether it modifies the buffer. If it expects a NUL-terminated string, correctness of prior string operations must be established; if it modifies the buffer, that could affect subsequent iterations or safety.\n\nThese symbols and properties are necessary to determine whether any of the string-handling calls (strlen, snprintf, sprintf) can read or write outside the bounds of OutputLine (or read past the end of Memory via strlen), and thus whether the code violates the MISRA rule about string handling functions accessing beyond object bounds."
