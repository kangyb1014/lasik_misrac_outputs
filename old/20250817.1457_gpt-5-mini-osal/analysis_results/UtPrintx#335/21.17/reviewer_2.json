  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following UtPrintx code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of UtPrintx.\n```c\nvoid UtPrintx(const void *Memory, uint32 Length)\n{\n    uint32       i;\n    uint32       j;\n    const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n    char         OutputLine[80];\n    char *       OutPtr;\n\n    i = 0;\n    while (i < Length)\n    {\n        snprintf(OutputLine, sizeof(OutputLine), \"%16lx: \", (unsigned long)&Byte_ptr[i]);\n        OutPtr = OutputLine;\n        OutPtr += strlen(OutputLine);\n        for (j = 0; j < 16 && i < Length; j++, i++)\n        {\n            sprintf(OutPtr, \"%02X  \", Byte_ptr[i]);\n            OutPtr += 3;\n        }\n\n        UT_BSP_DoText(UTASSERT_CASETYPE_INFO, OutputLine);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:Yes. OutPtr points into OutputLine (80 bytes). Each sprintf(OutPtr, \"%02X  \", Byte_ptr[i]) will write the formatted bytes plus a terminating NUL (for values < 256 the format produces 4 printable chars + NUL = 5 bytes). The code advances OutPtr by only 3 each iteration, and there is no check that the remaining space in OutputLine is sufficient. For example, if snprintf produced a 20\u2011byte prefix and the loop runs 16 times, sprintf would attempt to write 16*5 = 80 bytes starting at index 20 (indices 20..99), which overruns OutputLine (max index 79). Therefore the use of the string/formatting function here can result in accesses beyond the bounds of the object referenced by OutPtr/OutputLine and violates the rule.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nvoid UtPrintx(const void *Memory, uint32 Length)\n{\n    uint32       i;\n    uint32       j;\n    const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\n    char         OutputLine[80];\n    char *       OutPtr;\n\n    /* Open log file for append; if unavailable, logging is skipped. */\n    FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2687.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (log)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"---- UtPrintx ENTRY ----\\n\");\n        fprintf(log, \"Memory=%p Length=%u\\n\", Memory, (unsigned)Length);\n        fflush(log);\n    }\n\n    i = 0;\n    while (i < Length)\n    {\n        size_t out_size = sizeof(OutputLine);\n\n        if (log)\n        {\n            fprintf(log, \"LOOP start: i=%u remaining_length=%u\\n\", (unsigned)i, (unsigned)(Length - i));\n            fflush(log);\n        }\n\n        /* original prefix formatting retained */\n        snprintf(OutputLine, sizeof(OutputLine), \"%16lx: \", (unsigned long)&Byte_ptr[i]);\n\n        if (log)\n        {\n            int prefix_len = (int)strlen(OutputLine);\n            fprintf(log, \"snprintf produced prefix_len=%d prefix=\\\"%s\\\"\\n\", prefix_len, OutputLine);\n            fprintf(log, \"OutputLine buffer size=%zu\\n\", out_size);\n            fflush(log);\n        }\n\n        OutPtr = OutputLine;\n        OutPtr += strlen(OutputLine);\n\n        if (log)\n        {\n            ptrdiff_t offset = OutPtr - OutputLine;\n            size_t remaining = (out_size > (size_t)offset) ?

  "explanation": "The scenario described by agent A correctly demonstrates that UtPrintx can cause writes beyond the end of OutputLine: sprintf(OutPtr, \"%02X  \", ...) will write 4 printable characters + a terminating NUL (5 bytes) but OutPtr is only advanced by 3 bytes each iteration, and with a typical prefix length the 16 iterations can attempt to write past the 80\u2011byte buffer. However, MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 (as quoted) specifically concerns the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strlen, etc.). The offending call in this code is sprintf (and snprintf), which are formatted I/O functions from <stdio.h>, not functions from <string.h>. Therefore the code does present a real buffer-overrun risk, but that risk is not a violation of Rule 21.17 as stated \u2014 the report misattributes the problem to the wrong rule. The correct judgement is that the report is not correct with respect to Rule 21.17, although the code does violate MISRA guidance about safe use of library routines and bounded writes and should be fixed (for example, use snprintf with the remaining buffer size, check/track the number of bytes written, or ensure OutPtr is advanced by the actual written length and never allow writes beyond sizeof(OutputLine))."
