  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The parameters are: 'const void *Memory' and 'uint32 Length'. There are no assignments to Memory or Length, and neither parameter is incremented or otherwise altered. The code creates a local pointer 'const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;' \u2014 this copies the parameter value into a local variable and any pointer arithmetic or indexing (Byte_ptr[i]) operates on the local pointer, not the parameter itself. Passing &Byte_ptr[i] to snprintf only uses the address for formatting and does not modify the parameter. All other pointers (OutPtr, OutputLine) are local. Therefore Rule 17.8 is not violated and no fragments require investigation."
