  "explanation": "To decide whether UtPrintx violates the MISRA rule \"A pointer should point to a const\u2011qualified type whenever possible\" you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- uint8: the target function creates a const uint8 *Byte_ptr from Memory. You must know the exact typedef of uint8 (e.g. unsigned char) to reason about whether a pointer to that underlying type should be const-qualified and whether any implicit conversions from const void * are safe/allowed.\n\n- uint32: the parameter and loop counters use uint32; knowing its typedef ensures correct reasoning about value/size semantics but mainly confirms no pointer aliasing or integer/ pointer confusion affects const qualification decisions.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText (prototype): the function is called with OutputLine. You must know the parameter types (in particular whether it expects char * or const char *) to determine if OutputLine could/should be const and whether passing a const would be permitted. If UT_BSP_DoText mutates the buffer, OutputLine cannot be const.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_INFO (macro/enum/type): the first argument to UT_BSP_DoText; its type is needed to match the prototype of UT_BSP_DoText and ensure correct overload/parameter types are considered when checking constness of subsequent parameters.\n\n- snprintf (prototype): its signature (char *s, size_t n, const char *format, ...) documents which pointers are const-qualified (format is const char *) and that the destination buffer is non-const char *. This matters because OutputLine is written by snprintf; that proves OutputLine must be non-const.\n\n- sprintf (prototype): same rationale as snprintf: the destination parameter is non-const char *, so uses of sprintf(OutPtr, ...) show OutPtr must be a non-const pointer into OutputLine.\n\n- strlen (prototype): signature (const char *s) shows it accepts const data, but also its use in the code (OutPtr += strlen(OutputLine)) does not modify OutputLine. Knowing strlen's parameter constness helps reason about whether OutputLine could be const at that call site (combined with writes via snprintf/sprintf, it cannot).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine which pointers must be writable (non-const) because they are written to (snprintf/sprintf) and which are appropriately const (Memory/Byte_ptr), and whether any API expects non-const pointers (UT_BSP_DoText) that would force removal of const. This is sufficient to assess compliance with the MISRA pointer-to-const rule for UtPrintx."
