  "explanation": "I reviewed all pointer usages in the function:\n\n- Function parameter: \"const void *Memory\" \u2014 already points to a const-qualified type, so it complies with Rule 8.13.\n- Byte_ptr: declared as \"const uint8 *Byte_ptr = Memory;\" \u2014 the pointee is const-qualified, so this complies. (Note: the pointer itself is not modified after initialization; adding a top-level const (const uint8 * const) would make the pointer itself const, but Rule 8.13 concerns the pointee qualification.)\n- OutputLine: a local char array that is written into via snprintf/sprintf, so its elements must be modifiable; therefore it cannot be const-qualified.\n- OutPtr: declared as \"char *OutPtr\" and used as the destination for sprintf/snprintf writes into OutputLine; the pointee must be non-const to allow modification, so declaring it as pointing to const would be incorrect.\n- The address expression \"&Byte_ptr[i]\" is cast to an integer for printing; this is an integer conversion and not a pointer-to-pointee qualification issue for Rule 8.13.\n\nGiven the above, there are no pointer-to-pointee uses in this function that could (and should) be more const-qualified under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Therefore no suspicious code fragments are reported."
