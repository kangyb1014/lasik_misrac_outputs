  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_BinSemGetIdByName code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_BinSemGetIdByName.\n```c\nint32 OS_BinSemGetIdByName(osal_id_t *sem_id, const char *sem_name)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(sem_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(sem_name);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindByName(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sem_name, sem_id);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:Potential violation: if LENGTHCHECK(name, OS_MAX_API_NAME, ...) internally uses an unbounded string scan (e.g. strlen(name)) then a caller that supplies a non\u2013NUL-terminated buffer (or a buffer whose NUL is beyond its allocated size) will cause the string scan to read past the bounds of the object referenced by name. ARGCHECK only ensures name != NULL and does not prevent a buffer overrun. Example: caller provides a char buf[OS_MAX_API_NAME] that is not NUL-terminated; LENGTHCHECK calling strlen(buf) will continue reading past buf until a NUL is found, causing an out-of-bounds access and therefore a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_BinSem_ProbeLog(const char *stage, const void *sem_id_ptr, const void *sem_name_ptr, int return_code)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/959.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Log stage and pointer values.

  "explanation": "The claim is not supported. MISRA Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions causing out-of-bounds accesses. OS_BinSemGetIdByName itself does not call any string.h routines \u2014 it only checks for NULL pointers (via OS_CHECK_POINTER) and delegates to OS_ObjectIdFindByName. Whether a violation exists depends on how OS_ObjectIdFindByName (or any LENGTHCHECK macro it uses) performs name validation. The provided exhaustive test traces show that the function reaches the \"after_find\" probe and returns error codes (e.g. -13 and -17) rather than crashing when given the tested sem_name pointers (including non-NULL pointers that were intentionally not dereferenced by the probe). Under the stated assumption that the test suite is exhaustive and there are no missing scenarios, the observed behavior demonstrates that no unbounded scan (such as an unsafe strlen running past the buffer) occurred in these cases. Therefore Agent A\u2019s allegation of a MISRA 21.17 violation is not supported by the evidence; the report is incorrect."
