  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to decide if OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry is dead code:\n\n- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t\n  - The function assigns local_arg.opaque_arg = arg and then calls OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread(local_arg.id). To know whether that assignment is meaningful (i.e. whether reading .id uses the stored value), the exact definition of this union/struct is required (layout, whether opaque_arg and id are union members, types and any padding/aliasing). This determines if the write is used and thus whether the code is effective or removable.\n\n- (type of OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t.id)\n  - The concrete type of .id (and its valid value range/semantics) is needed to see if converting/storing arg into that member is well-defined and has runtime effect (for example, whether a cast/truncation or endian/size differences make the assignment a no-op).\n\n- OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread\n  - The single call in the target function. To determine whether removing OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry would change program behaviour we must know what OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread does (side effects, shared-state modifications, timing behaviour). If that callback has observable effects, then the entry function is not dead even if it has no static callers.\n\n- Callees of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread (OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_TaskDelay_Impl, OS_TimeBaseLock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdEqual, OS_TimeBaseUnlock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFromToken)\n  - These are needed to fully assess the observable behaviour of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread (resource manipulation, delays, locks, registrations). If OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread ultimately performs operations that affect system behaviour (timing, synchronization, object state), removing the entry would change the program; conversely, if all called work is itself unreachable/no-op, that affects the dead-code determination.\n\n- pthread_create (or any thread-creation wrapper used in this project)\n  - OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry has internal linkage (static) and the static call graph shows no callers. A common way such a static thread-entry function is used is by passing its address to pthread_create or an OS wrapper. You must inspect uses of pthread_create (or project-specific thread-creation APIs) to see if OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry is passed as the start routine. If it is, the function is reachable at runtime and not dead; if it is not referenced anywhere, it likely is dead.\n\n- Any translation-unit file-scope variables/initializers that take the address of OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry (&OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry or assignment to a function-pointer)\n  - Because static functions can be used via pointer within the same translation unit, any file-scope variables, initializers, or tables that store its address would make it live. You must inspect all such definitions in the TU to be sure there are no address-taken references that the static call graph missed.\n\n- Compilation/unit symbol map (references to OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry)\n  - A linker/object-symbol-level view (or whole-file cross-reference) is required to find any non-obvious uses (e.g., function-pointer tables built by macros, generated code, or data initializers). Since static call graphs can miss indirect references, this map is necessary to prove the function is unused (dead) or used.\n\nTogether these symbols/references let the next analyst determine whether the assignment to the wrapper and the call to OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread are ever executed in the built system and whether their removal would change observable behaviour (side effects, timing), which is required to decide conformance with the MISRA dead-code rule."
