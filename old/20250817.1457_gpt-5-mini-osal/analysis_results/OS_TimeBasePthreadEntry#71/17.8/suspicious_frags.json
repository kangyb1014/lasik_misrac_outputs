  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies the parameter variable 'arg'. The function only reads 'arg' and assigns its value into a local union member (local_arg.opaque_arg = arg), which is a copy into a local object and does not change the parameter itself. There is no assignment to 'arg', no increment/decrement, and no dereference-based modification of the object pointed to by 'arg' in this function. Therefore, with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (the pointer parameter itself must not be modified), there are no suspicious fragments to investigate in this function."
