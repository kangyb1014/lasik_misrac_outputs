  "explanation": "- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The target function stores the incoming void* into this wrapper and then reads local_arg.id. You must see the union/struct definition to know the types, sizes and aliasing of opaque_arg vs id, to verify there is no pointer reinterpretation that could lead to out-of-bounds string operations.\n- OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread: This is the direct callee. Any string.h usage that could violate bounds will be inside this function or in its callees; its implementation is essential to determine whether the id value passed from the wrapper is later used in string operations.\n- OS_TaskRegister_Impl, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease, OS_TaskDelay_Impl, OS_TimeBaseLock_Impl, OS_TimeBaseUnlock_Impl, OS_ObjectIdEqual, OS_ObjectIdFromToken: These are the static callees of OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread (per the call graph). You must inspect their implementations because they may perform buffer copies, name handling or other string operations that could be fed with data derived from the id/opaque_arg; any such uses must be checked for bounds.\n- Type definitions for the id/opaque_arg members: Knowing the exact typedefs (object id/token types, their sizes and representation) is needed to understand how the void* is reinterpreted and whether it could become a pointer to a buffer used by string functions.\n- Definitions of any global/static object tables or name/buffer fields referenced by the above functions: If the callees operate on global buffers (object name fields, tables) you must inspect those buffer definitions and sizes to determine whether subsequent string.h calls could overflow or read past bounds.\n- Any uses of standard string.h functions found in the above implementations: To apply the MISRA rule you must identify the actual string functions used (memcpy, strcpy, memset, etc.) and inspect their call sites (arguments and size parameters) in the callee implementations.\n\nIncluding these symbols (the wrapper type, the callback and its full transitive callees, the related typedefs and any buffers, and any string.h usages) provides the minimal context necessary to determine whether passing local_arg.id from OS_TimeBasePthreadEntry can lead to out-of-bounds accesses by standard string functions."
