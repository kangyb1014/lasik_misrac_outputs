  "explanation": "1) OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (definition): The function copies the incoming arg into local_arg. To judge whether a pointer should be const-qualified we must know the actual declaration of the wrapper (is it a union/struct, and what are its member types). This reveals whether opaque_arg is a void * or a const void * (or some other pointer type) and whether assigning arg loses const qualification.\n\n2) OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t::opaque_arg (exact member type/typedef): MISRA guidance concerns pointer target const-qualification. You must know the precise type of opaque_arg to decide if it should be const-qualified (and whether assigning the function parameter 'arg' to it changes constness).\n\n3) OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t::id (exact member type/typedef): The code passes local_arg.id to OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread. If id is an integer/token vs a pointer type affects whether the original pointer is ever used as a pointer (and therefore whether it should be const). Knowing the id type is required to decide if any pointer-to-non-const issues arise.\n\n4) OS_TimeBase_CallbackThread (prototype/definition): To determine whether the pointer (or value derived from it) is later used to modify pointed-to data, we must see what the callback expects (parameter types) and whether it dereferences/modifies memory. If the callback takes a pointer parameter, that parameter's constness is relevant; if it only takes an integer/token, the pointer may never be dereferenced here.\n\n5) Any typedefs used by the above (e.g. the typedef names that define id and opaque_arg): The concrete typedef names (object id/token types, pointer typedefs) are needed to check const qualifiers in the actual declarations rather than just relying on names.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to decide whether the pointer types in this function should be const-qualified or whether any const-qualification is being lost by the assignment/passing sequence."
