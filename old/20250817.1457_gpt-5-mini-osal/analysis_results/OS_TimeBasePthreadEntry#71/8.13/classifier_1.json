  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pthread entry must match the POSIX signature (void *(*)(void *)), so the parameter cannot be changed to point to a const-qualified type. The function treats arg opaquely (stores/passes it) and does not modify the pointee. A real Rule 8.13 violation would occur if the code modified the pointee through the pointer when it could have been declared as pointing to const."
