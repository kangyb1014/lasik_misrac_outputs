  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) and ensuring they do not access beyond the bounds of the objects passed. The provided target function OS_NetworkGetID and its implementation OS_NetworkGetID_Impl do not call any of those string handling functions or any memory copy/concatenation/string length functions. The only pointer usage is passing the address of a stack int32 (IdBuf) into OS_NetworkGetID_Impl, which assigns a scalar via *IdBuf = gethostid(); \u2014 this is a single scalar write, not an array/buffer operation, so there is no risk of out-of-bounds access related to string.h functions. The additional definitions (OS_SUCCESS macro and typedef for int32) likewise contain no string.h usage. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code relevant to Rule 21.17 that require further investigation."
