  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying a function parameter itself; modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed. In the provided code: - OS_NetworkGetID has no parameters, so it cannot violate Rule 17.8. - OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf) only writes to *IdBuf (the object pointed to) and does not assign to or otherwise modify the pointer parameter IdBuf itself. This is permitted by the rule. - The call OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) merely passes the address of a local variable; that does not modify any function parameter. - The typedef and #define are not function parameters. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
