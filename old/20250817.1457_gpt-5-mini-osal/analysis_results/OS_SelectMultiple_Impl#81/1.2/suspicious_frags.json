  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler language extensions in the provided code. The function and supporting definitions use standard C constructs: typedef aliases (int32 from int32_t), ordinary integer and struct types, preprocessor macros (OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERR_INVALID_ID), and POSIX-style fd_set/FD_ZERO usage (library types/macros, not compiler language extensions). There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __extension__, pragmas that are non-standard, inline assembly, or other extensions documented as compiler-specific. The array member in OS_FdSet uses a compile-time constant expression for its size, not a variable-length array. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
