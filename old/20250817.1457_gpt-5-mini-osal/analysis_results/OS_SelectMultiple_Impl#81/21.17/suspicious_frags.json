  "explanation": "This function contains no direct calls to the <string.h> functions covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The only code fragments that could potentially involve string.h routines (and thus need inspection for out-of-bounds accesses) are the listed macro/function calls \u2014 they may internally use functions like memset/memcpy/strlen/etc. All other fragments in the function are simple local variable declarations, integer comparisons/assignments, NULL checks, control flow (if/else/return) and do not invoke standard string handling functions, so they do not need to be investigated for Rule 21.17."
