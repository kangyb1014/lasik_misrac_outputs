  "explanation": "Rationale for each symbol\n\n- OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl (implementation/prototype): The target function calls this conversion helper. To determine whether any string.h calls inside it (or its internal buffer operations) access beyond object bounds you must inspect its code and prototype (parameter types, buffer sizes, return semantics).\n\n- OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl (implementation/prototype): Similar to ConvertIn, this is called after a successful select. Any use of memcpy/memset/strcpy/etc. inside it could cause out-of-bounds accesses; the implementation and prototype are required to check argument sizes and copying logic.\n\n- OS_DoSelect (implementation/prototype): The select wrapper is called with fd_set structures built here. Its implementation may manipulate buffers or call other helpers that use string.h functions; inspect it to ensure no unsafe string/memory operations occur and to verify how rd_set/wr_set are interpreted.\n\n- OS_FdSet (type/struct definition): The contents and layout of the OS_FdSet structure are required to verify how ConvertIn/ConvertOut read from or write to it (sizes, count of entries, internal buffers). Knowing field sizes lets you check whether any string/memory operations could overflow.\n\n- fd_set (type definition): rd_set and wr_set are of type fd_set; to reason about operations performed on them (and conversions from OS_FdSet) you need the exact fd_set layout/size to ensure any memory copy/clear operations are correctly bounded.\n\n- FD_ZERO (macro): The target uses FD_ZERO; knowing its expansion (e.g., a memset on fd_set) is necessary to determine whether that call itself uses string.h functions (memset) and whether it is used with correct bounds.\n\n- int32 (typedef): The function uses int32 and returns int32; the typedef is needed to ensure integer sizes are as expected when they are used in bounds calculations inside callees.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS (macro/enum) and OS_ERR_INVALID_ID (macro/enum): These return codes are used to control whether ConvertOut is called; understanding their definitions is necessary to follow control flow and know when potential string.h usage in callees would actually execute.\n\n- Any string.h functions used by the above implementations (e.g. memcpy, memset, strncpy, strcpy, strlen, memmove, memcmp, strcat, strncat, strspn): The MISRA rule directly concerns these functions. If any of the listed helper implementations call standard string.h functions, the exact call sites, argument values, and the sizes of the destination/source objects are required to determine if accesses could go out-of-bounds.\n\nIn short: the three direct callees (with their full implementations and prototypes), the definitions of the data structures and macros they operate on (OS_FdSet, fd_set, FD_ZERO), the integer/return-code typedefs/macros, and any actual uses of string.h functions inside those implementations are needed to determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
