  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible. In this function all pointer parameters and pointer usages require mutable (non-const) access:\n\n- ReadSet and WriteSet: both are read by OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl and later potentially written by OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl (the function updates the caller's sets with the select results). Because they are used for output, they cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- &rd_set and &wr_set (fd_set locals): these are initialized via FD_ZERO and then passed to OS_DoSelect, which modifies them to indicate ready descriptors; they are subsequently used by OS_FdSet_ConvertOut_Impl. They must be modifiable and cannot be const.\n\n- &maxfd: passed to OS_FdSet_ConvertIn_Impl to be updated with the highest file descriptor; it is modified by that call and thus cannot be const.\n\nBecause each pointer is either written to directly (FD_ZERO, ConvertOut_Impl, ConvertIn_Impl) or passed to functions that modify the pointed-to object (OS_DoSelect), none of them can be safely changed to point to const-qualified types. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 8.13 in this function."
