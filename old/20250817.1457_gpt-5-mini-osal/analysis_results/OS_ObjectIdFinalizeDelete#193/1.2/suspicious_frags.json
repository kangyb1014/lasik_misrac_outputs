  "explanation": "I found no occurrences of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically: - No use of __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... })gcc extension, nested functions, or other known compiler extensions. - The macro OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED uses a compound literal ((osal_id_t){0}), which is standard C (since C99), not a compiler extension. - All typedefs shown (int32 mapped to int32_t, osal_id_t to uint32) rely on standard fixed-width integer types from stdint.h, not extensions. - Function definitions, pointer dereferences (token->obj_id), and taking the address of a local ( &final_id ) are standard C constructs. Therefore there are no code fragments that, based on the provided source, require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you want, I can re-check against a specific compiler\u2019s documentation if you provide which compiler and its list of documented extensions."
