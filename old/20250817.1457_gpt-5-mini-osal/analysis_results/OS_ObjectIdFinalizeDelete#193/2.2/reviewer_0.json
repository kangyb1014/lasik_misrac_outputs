  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete.\n```c\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(int32 operation_status, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    osal_id_t final_id;\n\n    /* Clear the OSAL ID if successful - this returns the record to the pool */\n    if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        final_id = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* this restores the original ID */\n        final_id = token->obj_id;\n    }\n\n    /* Either way we must unlock the object type */\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, &final_id);\n\n    /* Give event callback to the application */\n    if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_NotifyEvent(OS_EVENT_RESOURCE_DELETED, token->obj_id, NULL);\n    }\n\n    return operation_status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The call to OS_NotifyEvent is dead when the global event handler is never installed. OS_NotifyEvent does nothing if OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler == NULL (it simply returns OS_SUCCESS). In a project configuration where OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler is always NULL (no code ever sets an event handler), the call inside if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS) { OS_NotifyEvent(...); } has no runtime effect and could be removed without changing program behaviour, therefore violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(int32 operation_status, OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    osal_id_t final_id;\n\n    /* Probe: log entry and input state */\n    {\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1546.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: entry operation_status=%ld, token=%p, token->obj_id=%ld\\n\",\n                    (long)operation_status, (void *)token, (long)token->obj_id);\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* Clear the OSAL ID if successful - this returns the record to the pool */\n    if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        final_id = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* this restores the original ID */\n        final_id = token->obj_id;\n    }\n\n    /* Probe: after computing final_id */\n    {\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1546.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: computed final_id=%ld\\n\", (long)final_id);\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* Either way we must unlock the object type */\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish(token, &final_id);\n\n    /* Probe: after transaction finish */\n    {\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1546.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: after OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish token->obj_id=%ld\\n\", (long)token->obj_id);\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* Give event callback to the application */\n    if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* Probe: about to call OS_NotifyEvent */\n        {\n            FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1546.txt\", \"a\");\n            if (f != NULL)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: about to call OS_NotifyEvent(OS_EVENT_RESOURCE_DELETED, obj_id=%ld)\\n\", (long)token->obj_id);\n                fclose(f);\n            }\n        }\n\n        OS_NotifyEvent(OS_EVENT_RESOURCE_DELETED, token->obj_id, NULL);\n\n        /* Probe: after calling OS_NotifyEvent */\n        {\n            FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1546.txt\", \"a\");\n            if (f != NULL)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: returned from OS_NotifyEvent\\n\");\n                fclose(f);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* Final probe: exit */\n    {\n        FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1546.txt\", \"a\");\n        if (f != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(f, \"OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: exit operation_status=%ld\\n\\n\", (long)operation_status);\n            fclose(f);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return operation_status;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete.

  "explanation": "Agent A's claim is not sufficiently supported. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 applies to code that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The agent's scenario assumes a project configuration in which OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler is never set and OS_NotifyEvent therefore \u2018\u2018does nothing\u2019\u2019. This is a configuration-specific claim and has not been established for the whole project; furthermore MISRA explicitly notes that \u2018\u2018behaviour\u2019\u2019 includes timing, so even a no-op return still may affect observable behaviour (timing, synchronization, instrumentation, profiling, etc.). The empty test log does not demonstrate the function is executed nor that the call has no observable effect. To prove a Rule 2.2 violation you must show across the entire project/configuration that OS_NotifyEvent unconditionally has no side effects (including timing and any interaction with shared/global state) and that removing the call would not change any observable behaviour. Absent that project\u2011level proof, the report is not correct."
