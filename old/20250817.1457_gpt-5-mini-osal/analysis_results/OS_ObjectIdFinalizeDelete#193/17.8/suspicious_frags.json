  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this function. The pointer parameter 'token' is only dereferenced (token->obj_id) and passed to other functions; the pointer variable itself is never assigned to or altered (no statements like token = ..., ++token, token += ..., etc.). The non-pointer parameter 'operation_status' is only read and returned, not modified. The local variable 'final_id' is assigned and its address is passed, but this does not modify any function parameter. Note: callees (OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, OS_NotifyEvent) may modify the object pointed to by 'token' (which is allowed by the rule) or modify their own parameters, but those are outside the scope of this function and should be checked in their respective implementations if needed."
