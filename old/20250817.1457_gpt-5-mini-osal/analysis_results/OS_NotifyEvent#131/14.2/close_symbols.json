The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA for\u2011loop analysis of OS_NotifyEvent:\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars\n  - Needed to see the definition/layout of the shared globals and to locate the EventHandler member. Access to the global itself and how/where it is modified could affect whether calling OS_NotifyEvent has side effects relevant to a for loop.\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler\n  - The actual function pointer member; the call site in OS_NotifyEvent invokes this pointer. To judge whether OS_NotifyEvent can violate the rule (by causing modifications to loop counters or loop control flags), the precise identity and semantics of this pointer must be known.\n\n- EventHandler function pointer typedef / prototype\n  - The declared type/signature documents what objects are passed (OS_Event_t, osal_id_t, void *) and whether the function can legally modify them (by value vs pointer). This is needed to reason about aliasing and potential modification of objects used as loop counters/control.\n\n- All functions that may be assigned to OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler (event-handler implementations)\n  - MISRA rule treats the behaviour of functions called inside a for loop as part of the loop body. Any concrete handler implementation that can be invoked by OS_NotifyEvent must be inspected for side effects: does it modify objects that could be used as the loop counter or loop control flag, or otherwise produce persistent side effects that violate clauses 2\u20134.\n\n- All registration/unregistration functions that set or clear OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler\n  - To determine the set of possible handler targets at call time, the code that assigns EventHandler must be examined (who registers which handler and when). This is necessary to build the call-set of potential side effects of OS_NotifyEvent.\n\n- OS_Event_t\n  - The event type passed into the handler: its definition is needed to see if it aliases or contains references to objects that might be loop counters or loop control flags, and to understand whether passing it could allow modification of loop control state.\n\n- osal_id_t\n  - The object identifier type passed to the handler: needed to check whether it can alias or refer to loop counters/control objects and whether handler implementations can modify such objects through it.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete\n- OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew\n- OS_TaskPrepare\n  - These four callers of OS_NotifyEvent must be reviewed for two reasons: (1) to see the calling contexts (is OS_NotifyEvent called from inside for loops, and if so what objects are used as loop counters and what arguments are passed into OS_NotifyEvent), and (2) to determine whether any of the arguments passed down from these call sites could allow OS_NotifyEvent (or the handler it calls) to modify loop counters or control flags. Understanding calling contexts is necessary to decide if OS_NotifyEvent, when invoked from those sites, can cause a MISRA violation.\n\n(Only the above symbols are required to determine whether OS_NotifyEvent itself or the functions it invokes can introduce forbidden side effects into a for loop body. OS_SUCCESS is not relevant to the for\u2011loop well\u2011formedness rule because it is only used as a return value and does not affect loop control or the behaviour of called functions.)"
