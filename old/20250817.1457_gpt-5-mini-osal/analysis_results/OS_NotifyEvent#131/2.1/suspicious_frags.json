  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- The if condition tests a pointer (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler != NULL) that is not a compile-time constant; both the true and false branches are therefore potentially reachable at runtime depending on program state. Neither branch contains statements that make following code unreachable.  \n- The function has a single return at the end that is reachable in all execution paths (both branches assign status and then flow to the return).  \n- There are no statements after the return, no constant-true/false conditions, no infinite loops, and no fall-through cases that would create unreachable code within this snippet.\n\nBased on the code shown, there is no obvious dead/unreachable code that requires investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. If additional project-wide invariants (for example, a guarantee that EventHandler is always non-NULL) exist, they should be documented and checked elsewhere, but such assumptions are not present in this fragment."
