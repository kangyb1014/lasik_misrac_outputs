  "explanation": "No language/compiler extensions are used in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs: a function definition, typedef-based types (int32, OS_Event_t, osal_id_t) which are ordinary aliases and not language extensions, a void* parameter, the NULL macro, access to a struct member (OS_SharedGlobalVars.EventHandler) and a standard function-pointer invocation via that member, assignment, and return. There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs (for example no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, nested functions, statement-expressions, __declspec, asm labels, or other documented compiler extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
