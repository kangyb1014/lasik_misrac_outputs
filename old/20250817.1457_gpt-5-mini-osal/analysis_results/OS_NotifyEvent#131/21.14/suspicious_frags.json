  "explanation": "No calls to memcmp (or any other C standard library string-comparison functions) appear in this function. The code only checks a function-pointer against NULL and calls it, returning an int32 status. There are no operations on null-terminated strings (no char* manipulations, no strcmp/strncmp/memcmp usage) in the provided fragment, so there are no places here that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (Any use of memcmp inside the referenced EventHandler is outside the scope of this fragment and would need to be inspected where that function is defined.)"
