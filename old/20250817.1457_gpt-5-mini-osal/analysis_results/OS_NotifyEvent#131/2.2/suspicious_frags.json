  "explanation": "The listed fragments are places where event-notification code is defined or invoked and therefore should be inspected for potential dead code (for example, if the global EventHandler remains NULL, many notification calls will have no effect and could be dead). Other code fragments in the provided excerpts were not included because they do not exhibit the characteristic of potentially removable operations that would not affect program behaviour: - Assignments to final_id in OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew and OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete are used subsequently (passed to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish and/or returned via outid), so they are not candidates for dead code. - The name-check and allocation logic in OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew (the sequence that sets return_code via OS_ObjectIdFindNextMatch/OS_ObjectIdFindNextFree and the subsequent error handling) affects control flow and return values and therefore cannot be removed without changing behaviour. - The GlobalState shutdown check is used to prevent object creation after shutdown and is not dead. - Calls where the return value from OS_NotifyEvent is assigned and then explicitly checked/used (e.g. the two locations where return_code is tested after the assignment) are not intrinsically dead because their outcome can influence subsequent logic. - OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish and other utility calls are used to manage state (unlocking, releasing resources) and so are not removable. The selected fragments focus on the event-callback implementation, its global default (NULL), and all direct call sites in the provided code where the notification could be a no-op; these should be investigated to determine whether the notifications (or branches within OS_NotifyEvent) constitute dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
