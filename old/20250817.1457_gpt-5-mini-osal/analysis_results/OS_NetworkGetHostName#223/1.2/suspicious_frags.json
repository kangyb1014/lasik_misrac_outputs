  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code. I checked for common compiler extensions such as GCC/Clang builtins or keywords (__attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline assembler, _Pragma or other implementation-defined keywords), none of which appear. The code uses standard C types (size_t, char *) and a typedef of int32_t to int32 (a C99 stdint type, not a compiler extension). The gethostname call is a POSIX library function (an OS API), not a compiler language extension covered by MISRA C: Rule 1.2. The shown macros (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_CHECK_SIZE) expand to other macros (BUGCHECK, ARGCHECK) but their definitions are not provided; the visible expansions do not themselves use language extensions, and there is no evidence in the supplied code that BUGCHECK/ARGCHECK use compiler extensions. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for use of language extensions."
