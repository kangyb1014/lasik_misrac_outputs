  "scenario": "No MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 violation. The statement host_name[0] = 0; does not call any <string.h> functions covered by Rule 21.17. Assuming OS_CHECK_POINTER(host_name) and OS_CHECK_SIZE(name_len) validate host_name != NULL and name_len > 0, the write is within bounds. A potential problem would occur only if OS_CHECK_SIZE does not ensure name_len > 0 (or is absent) \u2014 then host_name[0] = 0 would write out of bounds when name_len == 0."
