  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The fragment OS_CHECK_POINTER(host_name) does not invoke any functions from <string.h> and therefore cannot by itself cause accesses beyond the bounds of the object referenced by host_name. Rule 21.17 specifically targets use of the standard string handling functions; a simple null-pointer check is compliant. (Note: if the macro were implemented to dereference host_name or to call string.h functions such as strlen inside the macro, that implementation could violate the rule \u2014 but no such behavior is present in the shown fragment.)"
