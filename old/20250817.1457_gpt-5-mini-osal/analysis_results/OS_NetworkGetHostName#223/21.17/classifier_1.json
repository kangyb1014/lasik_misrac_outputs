  "scenario": "The fragment OS_CHECK_SIZE(name_len) by itself does not call any <string.h> functions and therefore does not directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, a violation can occur if the macro does not ensure name_len > 0 (or otherwise guarantee the buffer size) and subsequent code or the low-level implementation uses string.h functions that write into host_name. Example violating scenario: OS_CHECK_SIZE is a no-op (does not check size), name_len == 0, and OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl or other code calls strcpy(host_name, \"some_name\") or otherwise writes into host_name \u2014 this causes out-of-bounds writes and thus would breach Rule 21.17. Also host_name[0] = 0 in the failure path is an out-of-bounds write if name_len == 0."
