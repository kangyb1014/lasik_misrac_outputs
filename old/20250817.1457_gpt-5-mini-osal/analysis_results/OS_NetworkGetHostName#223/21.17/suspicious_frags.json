  "explanation": "The remaining fragments (the local declaration \"int32 return_code;\", the comment lines, the if-statement header and block structure \"if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS) { ... }\", and the final \"return return_code;\") do not perform any string handling nor index into the host_name buffer and therefore do not directly raise concerns under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The listed suspicious fragments are the only places in this function that involve the host_name pointer, its size parameter, or delegation to code that could perform string operations and thus require investigation."
