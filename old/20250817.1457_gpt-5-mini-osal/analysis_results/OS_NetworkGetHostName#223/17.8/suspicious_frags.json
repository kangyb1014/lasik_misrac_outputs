  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided code assigns to a pointer parameter variable itself. MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the parameter object that holds the pointer (e.g. doing `host_name = ...`), but allows modifying the object pointed to (e.g. `host_name[0] = 0`). The following points justify why other fragments need not be investigated:\n\n- In OS_NetworkGetHostName, the only operations on the parameter `host_name` are: the NULL check macro OS_CHECK_POINTER(host_name), passing it to OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl(host_name, name_len), and writing to the pointee (`host_name[0] = 0`) when an error occurs. Writing to the pointee is permitted by the rule; there is no assignment to the parameter variable itself.\n\n- In OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl, the pointer parameter `host_name` is passed to gethostname(host_name, name_len) and an element of the pointee is set (`host_name[name_len - 1] = 0`). Both are modifications of the pointed-to object (allowed). There is no code that reassigns `host_name`.\n\n- The macros OS_CHECK_POINTER and OS_CHECK_SIZE expand to checks (BUGCHECK/ARGCHECK) that only evaluate the expressions; they do not perform assignments to the parameter variable.\n\n- Other shown functions/macros (e.g. OS_printf, vsnprintf usage) either take const pointer parameters or only read/forward the pointer; they do not assign to the parameter variables.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments in the supplied code that appear to violate Rule 17.8 (no pointer parameter variable is modified)."
