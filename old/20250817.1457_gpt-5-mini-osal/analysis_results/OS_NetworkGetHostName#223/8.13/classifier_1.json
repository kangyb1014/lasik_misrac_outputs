  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: host_name is an output buffer (the function and its implementation write into it \u2014 e.g. host_name[0] = 0 and OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl(host_name, name_len)). Therefore the pointer must be to a modifiable char and using char * is appropriate. This usage does not breach MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If host_name were intended only for read access, then declaring it as char * instead of const char * would violate Rule 8.13.)"
