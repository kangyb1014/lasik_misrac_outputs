  "explanation": "No pointer-to-non-const issues were found in this function that would warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasons: \n\n- All pointer parameters that refer to input string data are declared to point to const-qualified types: File, Typename, ActualText, and RefText are const char * (correct for read-only use).\n- The UTASSERT_PREFIX is declared as static const char[] (const-qualified), so usage with strncmp is const-correct.\n- Local character buffers (ActualStr, RefStr, TagStr) are non-const arrays deliberately so they can be written to (snprintf, manual modifications, and later passed to UtAssert_GetValueText). These must be non-const to allow mutation and therefore are not violations.\n- Adjusting the pointer values (ActualText += ...) does not modify the characters they point to; it only changes the pointer itself while preserving the const qualification of the pointee \u2014 this is allowed and consistent with the rule.\n- Standard library calls used (snprintf, strncmp, strchr, isspace) are invoked with appropriately qualified pointer types; strchr is called with a const char * (Typename) which matches its prototype taking const char *.\n\nGiven the above, there are no pointer declarations in this fragment that could be more const-qualified without breaking required mutability, so no suspicious fragments to report for Rule 8.13."
