Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For verifying MISRA rule about well-formed for loops you must know any code that could introduce for-loops (or expand into them) in the context of this function and any called code that might be macro-expanded into this function. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- UtAssert_DoCompare: Called directly; if it is a macro or inlined function containing a for-loop or modifying loop counters, that would affect compliance. Need its definition/implementation.\n\n- UtAssert_GetValueText: Called directly and its implementation (or macro expansion) may contain for-loops or modify objects visible here (e.g., buffers) \u2014 include to check any for-loop semantics or side-effects.\n\n- UtAssert_GetOpText: Called directly; same rationale as above \u2014 its body or macro-expansion could introduce for-loops or side-effects relevant to the MISRA check.\n\n- UtAssertEx: Invoked in the return expression; its implementation (or macro) could contain for-loops or perform operations that interact with loop counters or control flags if expanded here \u2014 include to inspect for-loops or side-effects.\n\n- snprintf: Standard library function that may be implemented as a macro or call sequence; if it is macro-expanded (or has implementation details relevant to for-loops in this translation unit) it must be inspected for for-loop presence or side-effects.\n\n- isspace: Often a macro in <ctype.h> that may evaluate its argument multiple times or expand into code containing loops \u2014 include its definition to ensure no for-loops are introduced or unexpected side-effects.\n\n- strchr: Standard library routine; include its definition/implementation if macro-inlined in this build since it could contain loops affecting analysis.\n\n- strncmp: Same rationale as strchr/snprintf \u2014 if in this build it is a macro or inlined implementation, it could contain for-loops or side-effects.\n\n- UtAssert_Radix_DEFAULT and UtAssert_Radix_HEX: Enumeration or macro constants used to change behavior; need their definitions to be sure they are simple constants (not macros with side-effects) and to understand when RadixType can change (affects whether any code path uses constructs that could be for-loops).\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_FAILURE: Macro/constant passed into UtAssertEx; include to ensure it is a simple constant and not a macro that expands into code (which could include a for-loop).\n\n- UtAssert_Radix_t, UtAssert_Compare_t, UT_IntCheck_t: Type definitions used by the function signature and parameters. If any are implemented as macros or typedefs that expand to constructs with embedded loops or side-effects, that matters. Also their signed/unsigned semantics may affect conditional paths that could select different code (including macros) containing loops.\n\nNotes: The function source itself contains no for-statements; however MISRA\u2019s rule requires examining any code that could become part of a for-loop body via macro expansion or inlined calls. Therefore the concrete definitions/implementations (or macro forms) of the above symbols are required to determine whether any for-loop constructs or forbidden modifications of loop counters/flags are present in the effective code of UtAssert_GenericIntegerCompare."
