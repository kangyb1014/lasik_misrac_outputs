  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the provided fragment. The initialization of the EventHandler member to NULL does not demonstrate a pointer-to-non-const problem. The rule would be violated only if the declaration of EventHandler (or any other pointer member of OS_SharedGlobalVars_t) pointed to an object that is never modified but was declared without const (for example, a pointer to read-only data or a callback pointer that should not modify the pointed-to data). With the information shown, there is no evidence that a pointer should have been const-qualified, so Rule 8.13 is not violated."
