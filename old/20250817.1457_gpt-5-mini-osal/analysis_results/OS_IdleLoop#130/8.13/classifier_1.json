  "scenario": "No \u2014 the fragment '.EventHandler = NULL,' by itself does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rule 8.13 concerns how a pointer type is declared (the pointed-to type should be const-qualified when appropriate), not the act of initializing a pointer with NULL. If EventHandler is a function pointer (e.g. void (*EventHandler)(void)) then const-qualifying the function type is not applicable, so there is no violation. A concrete violation scenario would be if EventHandler were declared as a non-const data pointer (for example 'char *EventHandler;') but it only ever points to immutable data \u2014 in that case it should be declared 'const char *EventHandler;' and the current non-const declaration would violate Rule 8.13."
