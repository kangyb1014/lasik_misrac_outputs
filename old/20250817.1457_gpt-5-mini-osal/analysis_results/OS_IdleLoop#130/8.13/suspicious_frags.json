  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that should be const-qualified when possible. The OS_IdleLoop function itself contains no pointer declarations or pointer parameters and only reads a scalar GlobalState value, so it does not trigger Rule 8.13. The macro OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER is an integer constant, not a pointer. The other initializer entries (.GlobalState, .PrintfEnabled, .MicroSecPerTick, .TicksPerSecond, .DebugLevel) are scalar types (integers/bools) and not pointer types, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13. The call OS_IdleLoop_Impl() is a plain function call (no pointer usage shown here). Therefore only the global variable definition (which includes the EventHandler pointer initializer) and the EventHandler initializer itself are potential pointer-related sites that should be investigated for appropriate const qualification."
