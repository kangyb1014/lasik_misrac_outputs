  "explanation": "I have reported those fragments that are execution points or assignments which could plausibly be unused or redundant in some configurations and therefore warrant investigation for potential \"dead code\" per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. The remainder of the code not listed was not flagged because:\n\n- Global initialization via memset and the explicit initialization of OS_SharedGlobalVars fields are required to set a known state; removing these initializations would change program behaviour.\n- OS_BSP_Initialize(), OS_Application_Startup(), OS_DeleteAllObjects(), OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl(), and similar implementation hooks are platform/implementation entry/exit points or perform cleanup and therefore are not candidates for dead code without deeper knowledge of the platform.\n- Calls that perform process termination (exit(...)) or that visibly change shared state (assignments to OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState when invoked) affect program behaviour and thus are not dead code by the rule definition.\n- Comments and descriptive text are non-executable and thus not subject to the dead-code rule.\n\nThe fragments selected are those where either: (a) control flow may be permanently blocking or conditional in a way that a call/assignment may never have observable effect in some builds (e.g. idle loop and its suspending call), (b) global save/assignment may be unused depending on configuration (argc/argv, terminal control flags), or (c) handler-registration logic might be redundant depending on test-hook state. These should be reviewed to determine if any executed operation could be removed without changing the observable behaviour (i.e. actually dead) under any supported configuration."
