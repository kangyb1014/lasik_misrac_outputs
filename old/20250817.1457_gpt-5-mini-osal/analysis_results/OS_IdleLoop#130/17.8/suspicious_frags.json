  "explanation": "No function parameters are declared or modified in the provided code. OS_IdleLoop has no parameters, and the only identifier accessed is the global object OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState which is read (compared) but not assigned. The call to OS_IdleLoop_Impl() has no arguments, so there is no parameter passing or pointer modification visible here. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (which concerns modification of function parameters or pointer parameters themselves)."
