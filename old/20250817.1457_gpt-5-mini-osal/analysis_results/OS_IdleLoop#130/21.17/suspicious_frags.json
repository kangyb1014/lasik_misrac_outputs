  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided OS_IdleLoop function use any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). The function contains only: a comparison of a global scalar (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState) against a compile-time constant macro (OS_SHUTDOWN_MAGIC_NUMBER) and a call to OS_IdleLoop_Impl(). There are no pointer parameters, no array or buffer accesses, and no direct uses of string-handling library calls in the shown code, so there is nothing here that can produce out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses via the standard string functions.\n\nNote: OS_IdleLoop_Impl() is invoked but its implementation is not provided in the supplied code. If that implementation (or other code not shown) calls any <string.h> functions, those locations would need to be inspected; however, they are not part of the given code fragment and thus cannot be reported here."
