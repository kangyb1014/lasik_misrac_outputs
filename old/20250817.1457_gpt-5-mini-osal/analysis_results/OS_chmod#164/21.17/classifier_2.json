  "scenario": "OS_TranslatePath could copy or concatenate the input path into local_path using string.h functions (e.g. strcpy, strcat, memcpy) without checking the length. If the translated path length is >= OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN (or does not leave room for a terminating NUL), the copy would write beyond local_path bounds, violating Rule 21.17."
