  "scenario": "The array declaration itself does not call any <string.h> functions so it does not by itself violate Rule 21.17. A violation can occur if the translator/writer routine writes more bytes than OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN into local_path using string functions. For example, if OS_TranslatePath(local_path) does strcpy(local_path, path) or strcat/local_memcpy without bounds checking and strlen(path) >= OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN, then accesses beyond local_path[] bounds would occur and Rule 21.17 would be violated."
