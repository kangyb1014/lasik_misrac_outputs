  "explanation": "The remaining fragments (e.g. \"int32 return_code;\", the assignment/return statements, the if-check: \"if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\", and the final \"return return_code;\") do not perform any string handling or buffer writes/reads themselves. They are simple scalar declarations, control flow, and assignments that do not invoke or imply the use of <string.h> functions and therefore cannot by themselves violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The only code locations that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses via standard string functions are the buffer declaration/size and the calls that pass/receive character buffers, which are the fragments listed above."
