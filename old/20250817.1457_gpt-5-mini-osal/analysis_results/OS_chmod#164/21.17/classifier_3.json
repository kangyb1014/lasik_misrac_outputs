  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The token OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN by itself does not call any <string.h> functions and so does not breach Rule 21.17. (Rule 21.17 applies to uses of functions like strcpy/memcpy/etc., none of which appear in the fragment.)\n\nPotential violation scenario (not present here): if OS_TranslatePath copies path into local_path using an unbounded function (e.g. strcpy or memcpy) without checking that strlen(path) < OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN, then an access beyond the bounds of local_path would occur and Rule 21.17 would be violated."
