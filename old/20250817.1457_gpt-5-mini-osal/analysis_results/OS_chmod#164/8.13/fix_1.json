  "explanation": "The original source was cut off inside the final fprintf call which caused a parse/compile error. I completed the function by printing the return_code, using the PRIu32 macro to print the uint32 access_mode portably, and closing the file with fclose. No other logic or signatures were changed; only the missing/unfinished lines were added so the file compiles successfully."
