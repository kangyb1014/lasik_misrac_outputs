  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment declares a modifiable array (char local_path[...]) not a pointer type. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations pointing to const-qualified types; an array declaration is not a pointer declaration, so the rule does not apply here. (A violation would occur if a pointer were declared as char *p when it could/should be const char *p.)"
