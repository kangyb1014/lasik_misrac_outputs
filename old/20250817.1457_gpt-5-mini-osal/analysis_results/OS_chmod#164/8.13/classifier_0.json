  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment: the function parameter is declared 'const char *path', so the pointer is const-qualified as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. A violation scenario would be if OS_TranslatePath were declared to take a non-const pointer for the input path (for example: 'int32 OS_TranslatePath(char *path, char *local_path);'), causing the const qualification of 'path' to be discarded when passed \u2014 that would violate Rule 8.13."
