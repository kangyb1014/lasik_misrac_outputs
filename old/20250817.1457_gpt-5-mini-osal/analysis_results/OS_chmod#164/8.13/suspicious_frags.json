  "explanation": "The function parameter 'path' is already declared as const char *, so it is already const-qualified and does not need investigation. The other identifiers in the function (access_mode, return_code, OS_SUCCESS, numeric return) are non-pointer scalar types and not relevant to Rule 8.13. No other pointer usages appear in the function beyond the fragments listed above, so only those fragments need investigation for possible non-const pointer parameters or unnecessary omission of const-qualification."
