  "explanation": "The flagged fragments are included because they are operations executed in the current code that may have no effect in this build or could be redundant (and thus potentially constitute dead code) and therefore warrant investigation. Other parts of the code need not be investigated for dead-code under MISRA Rule 2.2 for the following reasons:\n\n- Parameter checking (OS_CHECK_POINTER) and early-return of error codes: these checks are control-flow/defensive code that affect program behavior when inputs are invalid and must be preserved.\n\n- Token acquisition and release (OS_ObjectIdGetById / OS_ObjectIdRelease and the surrounding record/module lookups): these perform object-index resolution and locking/transaction bookkeeping; removing them would change locking semantics and object access behavior, so they are not dead.\n\n- Using the object tables via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: these are the mechanism to obtain the referenced records and are necessary for correct behavior.\n\n- The strncpy calls are suspected above because of the combination with the prior memset and the known no-op implementation of OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl; however the rest of the code that copies from record/module to module_prop is clearly intended to populate the API-visible structure and cannot be assumed dead without inspection \u2014 hence they are flagged for review but other uses of the record/module variables are not flagged.\n\n- The release/finish transaction call (OS_ObjectIdRelease) is required to restore global lock/transaction state. Removing it would alter concurrency/locking semantics.\n\n- The remainder of OS_printf (formatting, vsnprintf, and OS_ConsoleWrite) is active functionality used when printing is enabled; these operations clearly affect observable behavior when printing is enabled and therefore are not dead.\n\nI focused the suspicion on operations that (a) are effectively no-op in the provided implementation (OS_ModuleGetInfo_Impl), (b) may rely on prior initialization that might be redundant (memset plus strncpy usage), and (c) debug/conditional logging that may be compiled out or be a no-op depending on configuration (OS_DEBUG use). These should be inspected to determine whether they are live, have side-effects, or can be safely removed."
