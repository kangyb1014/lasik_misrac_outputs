  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the actual definitions and declarations of all types, macros and called routines it relies on:\n\n- bool: Verify whether 'bool' is the standard boolean (from <stdbool.h>) or a compiler-specific extension or macro/typedef. If 'bool' is a project typedef or maps to a compiler-specific keyword, that could be a language extension.\n\n- OS_creator_filter_t: The filter variable type may be a typedef or struct that uses compiler extensions (compiler attributes, bitfields with nonstandard widths, packed/unaligned attributes, flexible-array members, or GCC extensions). Inspect its definition.\n\n- OS_common_record_t: The function dereferences 'obj->active_id' and 'obj->creator'; the struct definition could contain extension constructs (attributes, packed, anonymous structs/unions, designated initializers in macros, or other nonstandard features). Check its declaration.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: Even though 'token' is unused in the body, its type declaration could use extensions (attributes, calling-convention macros, etc.) that must be checked.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY: This macro/constant could be defined using compiler extensions (e.g., statement-expressions ({ ... }) , nonstandard casts, or compiler-specific builtins). Inspect its definition to ensure no extension usage.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid (declaration/definition): The call may be a macro that expands to extension constructs, or its prototype/definition may use nonstandard types or attributes. You must check the actual declaration/definition to ensure no language extensions are used.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual (declaration/definition): Same rationale as above \u2014 it could be a macro or inline function using extensions. Verify its implementation/declaration.\n\n- typedef/definition of the object-id type used for obj->active_id / obj->creator / filter->creator_id: The concrete typedef (e.g., an OS_object_id_t or similar) must be inspected because it may be defined using compiler-specific extensions (special integer widths, attributes, or macros). The member types are central to calls and comparisons in the function.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their headers/declarations/definitions) lets the next analyzer determine whether any of the identifiers used in the function resolve to compiler-specific language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
