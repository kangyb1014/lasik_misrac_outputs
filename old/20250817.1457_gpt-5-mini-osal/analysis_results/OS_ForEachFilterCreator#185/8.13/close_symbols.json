  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for the MISRA C 'pointer-to-const where possible' analysis:\n\n- OS_creator_filter_t\n  - Needed to determine the exact member types and whether the filter object is ever mutated. The rule concerns whether the incoming ref should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type; that depends on whether any members of this struct are modified by the function or by other code that expects a non-const pointer.\n\n- OS_common_record_t\n  - Required to confirm the types of obj->active_id and obj->creator and whether those members are read-only in this context. The parameter obj is already const in the function, but knowing the struct layout and member types is necessary to ensure const correctness and that no implicit casts or mutable members force non-const.\n\n- (type of) active_id member\n  - The exact type of active_id (e.g., OS_object_id_t or a pointer) is needed to see whether OS_ObjectIdIsValid accepts that type as a const parameter or requires a non-const argument. That affects whether obj (and by relation other pointers) could or should be const.\n\n- (type of) creator member\n  - Same reason as active_id: we must know the type passed to OS_ObjectIdEqual and whether that API requires mutable data, which would prevent making the pointer-to-filter or its creator_id member const.\n\n- OS_object_id_t (if used)\n  - If active_id/creator are typedefs to a named type, inspect its definition (e.g., whether it is a scalar, struct, or pointer) to decide how const qualification applies and whether changing pointer constness is feasible.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid (prototype)\n  - The function signature shows whether its parameter(s) are const-qualified. If OS_ObjectIdIsValid takes a non-const pointer (or non-const reference), then callers cannot pass a const-qualified object without a cast; this influences whether obj or its members can be const.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual (prototype)\n  - Likewise, its parameter constness determines whether filter->creator_id and obj->creator can be const. If OS_ObjectIdEqual requires non-const arguments, the callback cannot safely take a const filter pointer without modifying that API or using casts (which MISRA discourages).\n\n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY (macro/constant)\n  - Need the type of this constant (e.g., integral, special value, or typed object id) to confirm compatibility with creator_id and whether comparisons use const-correct types.\n\n- callback function typedef / for-each API prototype that defines the signature of this callback (i.e., the declaration that requires a void *ref)\n  - Crucial to know whether the iterator/registration API that invokes OS_ForEachFilterCreator mandates a void *ref (non-const). If the API's callback typedef forces a non-const void* parameter, the function signature cannot be changed to const void* without breaking the API. This determines whether the absence of const on ref is avoidable or required by the surrounding API.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets an analyst determine (1) whether OS_ForEachFilterCreator actually modifies the pointed-to data, (2) whether the callee functions require mutable arguments, and (3) whether the callback API forces a non-const parameter \u2014 all necessary to decide if a const-qualified pointer should be used per MISRA."
