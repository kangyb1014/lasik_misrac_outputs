  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 based on the provided code: the token and obj parameters are already const-qualified (const OS_object_token_t *token, const OS_common_record_t *obj). The remaining members in OS_creator_filter_t (creator_id and user_callback) are not pointer types and thus not subject to this pointer const-qualification rule. The incomplete declaration of OS_common_record_t is present but the function uses a const-qualified pointer to it, so no further const-qualification is missing there. No other pointer declarations appear in the shown code. The listed fragments are the places where a pointer-to-non-const is observable and should be reviewed to determine whether it could or should be a pointer-to-const per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
