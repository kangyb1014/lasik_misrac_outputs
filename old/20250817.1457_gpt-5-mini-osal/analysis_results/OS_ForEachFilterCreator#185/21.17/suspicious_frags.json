  "explanation": "No calls to any functions from <string.h> are present in the provided code fragments. The function OS_ForEachFilterCreator performs boolean checks and comparisons of object identifier values only; it does not copy, move, or inspect character buffers. The helper OS_ObjectIdEqual shown is an integer comparison via OS_ObjectIdToInteger and likewise contains no string handling. There is no use of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or any other string/byte-buffer operations in the supplied code, nor any pointer arithmetic or char-buffer access that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
