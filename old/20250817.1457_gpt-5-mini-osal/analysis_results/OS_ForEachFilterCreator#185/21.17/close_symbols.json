  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can violate the MISRA rule about out-of-bounds string.h usage you must inspect the functions it calls and the types/values passed into them: \n- OS_ObjectIdEqual (prototype + implementation): needed to see whether it uses string.h routines (memcmp/strcmp/strncmp/etc.), how it computes lengths/limits, and what assumptions it makes about its input buffers. If it calls a string.h function, its implementation reveals whether calls could access out-of-bounds memory for the arguments passed here.\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid (prototype + implementation): while this likely performs validity checks, its logic may affect whether later comparisons are safe; inspect whether it touches or normalizes the same object-id objects or invokes string.h functions.\n- OS_creator_filter_t (struct/typedef containing creator_id): the type/shape of filter->creator_id determines whether it is a pointer to a buffer/string or a scalar, and therefore whether passing it to OS_ObjectIdEqual could cause string functions to read beyond bounds.\n- OS_common_record_t (struct/typedef containing active_id and creator): need the exact types of obj->active_id and obj->creator to know what is being passed into OS_ObjectIdIsValid/OS_ObjectIdEqual and whether they are strings/pointers with length constraints.\n- typedef for the object-id type used in creator_id/creator/active_id: the underlying typedef (name and size/representation) is required to judge whether comparisons are pointer/string-based and to check bounds assumptions.\n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY (macro/constant definition): its type/value matters (e.g., special constant, pointer, sentinel) because it is passed to OS_ObjectIdEqual and may affect which overload/branch is taken and whether any string functions are invoked.\n- Any macros/constants that bound object-id/name sizes (e.g., OS_MAX_API_NAME, OS_MAX_NAME_LEN): if OS_ObjectIdEqual or related code relies on compile-time limits, you must know those limits to determine if string.h calls use correct length arguments and cannot overrun buffers.\n- Any functions called by OS_ObjectIdEqual/OS_ObjectIdIsValid that come from <string.h> (e.g., memcmp, strcmp, strncmp): including these shows the actual standard-library calls and their parameters so you can verify that length/size arguments are correct and do not permit out-of-bounds access.\n\nCollecting these symbols (implementations/prototypes and related size macros) is sufficient to decide whether any string.h usage reachable from OS_ForEachFilterCreator can access beyond object bounds."
