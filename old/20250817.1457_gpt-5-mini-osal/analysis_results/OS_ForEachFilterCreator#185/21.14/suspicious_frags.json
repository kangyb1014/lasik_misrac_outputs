  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp are present in the provided code fragment. The function only calls OS_ObjectIdIsValid and OS_ObjectIdEqual and performs logical checks on object identifiers; it does not perform any string operations or direct comparisons of null\u2011terminated strings. Therefore there are no code locations here that potentially violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. (If the implementation of OS_ObjectIdEqual used memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings, that implementation \u2014 which is not included here \u2014 would need review, but it is outside the supplied code fragment.)"
