  "explanation": "- OS_ObjectIdEqual (implementation): Needed to see how equality is implemented. If it uses memcmp to compare character buffers or null-terminated strings, that would trigger the MISRA rule. The implementation shows whether memcmp is used and on what operand types.  \n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid (implementation): Required to verify it does not perform any string comparisons with memcmp that would implicate this call site; also to understand the type semantics of the id being validated.  \n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY (macro/constant definition): To determine whether this is a special numeric constant or a string sentinel; if it is a char* or string literal, comparison semantics could be impacted.  \n- OS_creator_filter_t (struct/typedef): To know the exact type and layout of filter->creator_id (e.g., whether it is an integer id, a fixed-size char array, or a char*), which determines whether memcmp would be an inappropriate way to compare null-terminated strings.  \n- OS_common_record_t (struct/typedef): To know the exact type and layout of obj->creator and obj->active_id (e.g., whether creator is a string or other type) so we can judge whether any memcmp in equality checks operates on null-terminated strings.  \n- typedef for the object identifier used for creator/creator_id (e.g., OS_object_id_t): Explicit typedef/definition of the identifier type used by OS_ObjectIdEqual/OS_ObjectIdIsValid to confirm whether identifiers are strings or opaque/integer types.  \n- memcmp (standard library function): Include the symbol to check if it is invoked (directly or inside OS_ObjectIdEqual) and to assess whether it is ever used to compare null-terminated strings (the MISRA concern).  \n- OS_object_token_t (typedef/struct): Included for completeness to understand any related types in the signature; not likely to affect memcmp usage here but useful if the token/type aliases reveal string usage for ids.\n\nThese symbols together allow the next analyst to determine whether any string comparison in the called equality/validation logic uses memcmp on null-terminated strings, and thus whether the target function is implicated in a MISRA C memcmp-on-strings violation."
