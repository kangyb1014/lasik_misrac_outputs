  "explanation": "All other parts of the provided code are simple declarations or not present in the snippet and therefore do not present additional candidates for unreachable code. There are no statements after a return, no dead switch/case blocks, no unconditional infinite loops, and no other functions or code paths in the provided snippets that could be statically identified as unreachable. The listed fragments capture the expressions and definitions that could cause or reveal unreachable sub-expressions (for example via constant folding, implementation-defined mapping functions, or macro values) and thus should be investigated further."
