  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ForEachFilterCreator:\n```c\nbool OS_ForEachFilterCreator(void *ref, const OS_object_token_t *token, const OS_common_record_t *obj)\n{\n    OS_creator_filter_t *filter = ref;\n\n    /*\n     * Check if the obj_id is both valid and matches\n     * the specified creator_id\n     */\n    return (OS_ObjectIdIsValid(obj->active_id) && (OS_ObjectIdEqual(filter->creator_id, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) ||\n                                                   OS_ObjectIdEqual(obj->creator, filter->creator_id)));\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn (OS_ObjectIdIsValid(obj->active_id) && (OS_ObjectIdEqual(filter->creator_id, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) ||\n                                                   OS_ObjectIdEqual(obj->creator, filter->creator_id)));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The expression computes a boolean result using function calls and logical operators; short\u2011circuiting may prevent some calls from being executed but that is not dead code. All operations that can be executed contribute to the returned value, so removing any executed call would (potentially) change behavior. (Hypothetical violation would require an executed operation with no effect\u2014e.g. a call with no side effects whose result is never used\u2014but that does not apply here.)"
