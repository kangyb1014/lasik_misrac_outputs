  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d you must confirm that none of the pointer parameters (ref, token, obj) or the objects they refer to are being modified (or passed to callees that modify them). The listed symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- OS_creator_filter_t\n  - Needed to know the type of filter and the type/const-qualification of its member creator_id. This lets you determine whether assigning filter = ref changes the parameter ref (type/qualifier mismatch) or discards const, and whether accessing filter->creator_id could imply modification of the object referenced by ref.\n\n- OS_common_record_t\n  - Required to inspect the types and const-qualifiers of obj->active_id and obj->creator. This shows whether reading those members from a const OS_common_record_t * is legal and whether passing those members to the called functions can lead to modification of *obj.\n\n- OS_object_token_t\n  - Although token is unused in the function body, its type/qualification should be known to show that the parameter is not modified (and that no hidden side effects occur via macros or inline code that reference token).\n\n- OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY\n  - The macro/constant must be examined to ensure it has no side effects (e.g., it is not defined as an expression that assigns to an argument). It's used in the comparison and could affect whether any parameter is modified.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIsValid (declaration/definition)\n  - You need the prototype and/or implementation to confirm it does not accept pointers to the function parameters (or otherwise modify objects passed). If it is a macro or function that takes pointers or non-const references, it could indirectly modify parameters or objects.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdEqual (declaration/definition)\n  - Same reason as above: confirm its signature/implementation does not modify its arguments (for example, if it were a macro that took lvalues and gave them side effects). In particular, ensure comparisons use values or const parameters so that passing obj->creator or filter->creator_id cannot cause modification.\n\nIn short: obtain the type definitions for the pointer-targeted structures, the constant macro definition, and the prototypes/implementations of the two called routines (or their macro bodies). With those you can conclusively determine whether any function parameter variable or the objects they point to are modified in this function (directly or via callees)."
