  "explanation": "Other fragments need not be investigated for Rule 17.8 because they do not modify function parameters: - The token and obj parameters are declared const and are only dereferenced for reads (obj->active_id, obj->creator), so no modification of the pointer parameters or pointed-to objects occurs in the shown code. - There are no assignments to the parameter variables (ref, token, obj) elsewhere in the function body. - The comment and surrounding whitespace/typedef/macro definitions do not affect parameter modification. - Calls to the helper functions/macros shown (OS_ObjectIdIsValid, OS_ObjectIdEqual) are used in boolean expressions only; based on the presented code there is no evidence they modify the passed-in parameters here. If those helper functions have side effects, they should be reviewed separately, but they are outside the provided fragment."
