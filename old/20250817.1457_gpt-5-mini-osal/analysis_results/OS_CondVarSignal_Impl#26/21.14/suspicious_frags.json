  "explanation": "I examined the provided target function and the related definitions. There are no calls to memcmp anywhere in the target function or the supplied additional code. The macros and functions shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) perform numeric index extraction and array indexing, not string operations. The OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t fields are pthread types (mutex/condvar), not char arrays or string pointers. The OS_object_token_t type is not shown as a character/string type, and no code fragments perform string comparisons. Therefore there are no instances in the supplied code that use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings and nothing here requires investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If there are other source files not provided, those should be searched for memcmp usages comparing C strings."
