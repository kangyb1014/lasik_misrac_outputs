  "explanation": "No unreachable code is present in the provided function. Reasoning: all statements are reachable at runtime \u2014 the macro-based lookup (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...)) executes unconditionally; the call to pthread_cond_signal(...) executes and may return 0 or a nonzero error code at runtime, so both branches of the subsequent if (status != 0) { return OS_ERROR; } and the final return OS_SUCCESS; are potentially reachable. The macro expansion yields OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token) (since OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is invoked with *token and the macro takes the address), which does not introduce any compile-time constant condition or omitted code path that would make any statement unreachable. There are no unconditional returns, infinite loops, or compile-time-constant conditionals that would render code unreachable. Note: potential issues such as null token dereference or runtime UB are not violations of MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) and thus are out of scope for this rule check."
