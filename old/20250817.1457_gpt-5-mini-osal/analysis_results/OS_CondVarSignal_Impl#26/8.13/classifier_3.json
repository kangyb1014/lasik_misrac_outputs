  "scenario": "No violation. pthread_cond_signal expects a pointer to a modifiable pthread_cond_t and may modify its underlying state, so taking &impl->cv as a non-const pointer is appropriate. A Rule 8.13 violation would occur if the object could be const-qualified (for example if impl were declared const OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t *impl or impl->cv could be declared const) but a non-const pointer was used when a const-qualified pointer was possible."
