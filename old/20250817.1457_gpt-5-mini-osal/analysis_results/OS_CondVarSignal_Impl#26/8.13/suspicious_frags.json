  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter 'token' is already a pointer to a const-qualified type; 'status' is a plain int and not a pointer; the return statements only return integer status codes. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer dereferences in this function beyond the ones listed above, so no additional fragments are relevant to the guideline."
