  "explanation": "No uses of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code fragment. The function only: obtains an impl pointer via OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, calls pthread_cond_signal(&impl->cv), and returns status codes. There is no buffer manipulation, no copying of memory or strings, no pointer arithmetic or array indexing that could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses related to string handling. The only macro used (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) is not expanded here; based on the visible code there are still no string functions to inspect. Therefore there are no fragments in this snippet that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
