  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to the form and contents of for statements. I inspected the provided function and all related definitions and found no for statements anywhere (neither in the function body, nor in the macro expansion, nor in the inline helper, nor in the data declarations). Details of the inspection:\n\n- OS_CondVarSignal_Impl: contains no for loop \u2014 only variable declarations, a table lookup via a macro, a call to pthread_cond_signal, and returns. No for statements to assess.\n\n- OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro: expands to an array indexing with a call to OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&tok). This does not introduce any for statements. (Note: the macro takes the address of tok; in the usage shown tok is *token so the address-of applied to the dereference yields the original pointer \u2014 no for loop or hidden iteration.)\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken inline function: is a simple return of token->obj_idx with no loops.\n\n- OS_impl_condvar_table declaration: is a static array, not a loop.\n\n- OS_impl_condvar_internal_record_t typedef and OS_object_token_t typedef: are structure/type definitions only, no executable for statements.\n\n- The call to pthread_cond_signal and the check of its return value contain no for loops.\n\nBecause there are no for statements in any of the provided code fragments (including macro expansions and inline functions), there are no code fragments that need to be investigated for compliance with Rule 14.2. If you have additional source files or other macros that might expand to for loops, please provide them for review."
