  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify any function parameter (token, start_time, interval_time) or the pointer parameter itself. Specific checks performed:\n\n- token is only dereferenced via *token in OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) to obtain object pointers (local and timebase). This reads the pointed value; it does not reassign the token pointer variable. Modifying the object pointed-to (local->... and timebase->...) is allowed by Rule 17.8.\n- start_time and interval_time are passed by value (to OS_UsecToTimespec) and used in comparisons (interval_time > 0); there are no assignments to these parameters.\n- There is no pointer arithmetic or reassignment involving token, nor any assignment to start_time or interval_time anywhere in the function.\n- Calls such as OS_UsecToTimespec(...), timer_settime(...), and strerror(errno) do not modify the parameter variables in this function.\n\nThe only potential area to inspect further would be the definition of the macro/function OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET if it had surprising side effects; however, in this code it is invoked with *token (a value) and the expansion shown here does not reassign the token parameter. Therefore no fragments need investigating for Rule 17.8."
