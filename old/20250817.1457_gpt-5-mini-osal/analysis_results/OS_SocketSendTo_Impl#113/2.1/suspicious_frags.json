  "explanation": "Fragments not listed are not suspected of being unreachable and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1: - The AF_INET case and its assignment to addrlen are used for the common IPv4 path and can be reached when sa->sa_family == AF_INET. - The sendto call and its subsequent error handling (os_result check and returns) are reachable depending on runtime return value of sendto. - The final return of os_result is reachable on successful sendto. - The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET call and the assignment to impl are executed before any control-flow branches and are not unreachable. - The use of RemoteAddr->AddrData to form sa is used by the switch and subsequent operations; it is reachable. The four fragments reported should be investigated because they are the places where code presence/exclusion (preprocessor guard), unconditional default handling, an early return based on addrlen, and a macro that expands to nothing could lead to unreachable or effectively removed code depending on build configuration or runtime conditions."
