  "explanation": "Most pointer uses in this function already point to const-qualified types: the function parameters are declared const where appropriate (const OS_object_token_t *token, const void *buffer, const OS_SockAddr_t *RemoteAddr), and the local sockaddr pointer is declared const (const struct sockaddr *sa) and assigned via a cast to const. The sendto call also expects const-qualified pointers and the arguments match that. The only local pointer declared without const qualification is 'impl' which is assigned from OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and thereafter only read (its fd member is used). Therefore 'impl' (and its assignment) should be investigated to determine whether it can be declared as a pointer to const (e.g. const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl) to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. No other pointer declarations or uses in the shown code appear to require investigation under this rule."
