  "explanation": "No calls to the standard <string.h> functions that can access object buffers beyond their bounds (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the function. The only string-related use is strerror(), which: (a) is not one of the listed buffer-manipulating functions and takes an int parameter (it does not take a pointer to a caller-supplied buffer that could be overrun), and (b) in this code is wrapped by OS_DEBUG which is defined empty, so no runtime call is produced. The use of sendto() uses buffer and buflen but is a system/socket call, not a <string.h> function governed by Rule 21.17, and the address length is explicitly checked against RemoteAddr->ActualLength before the call. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
