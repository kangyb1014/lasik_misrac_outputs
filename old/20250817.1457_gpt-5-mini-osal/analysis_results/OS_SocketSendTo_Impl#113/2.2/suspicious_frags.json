  "explanation": "The other code fragments in the function are not flagged because they perform observable work or their removal would change behaviour: the local variables (os_result, addrlen, sa, impl) are assigned and subsequently used (addrlen is validated against RemoteAddr->ActualLength; impl->fd is passed to sendto; os_result is returned). The switch branches (AF_INET and default) compute addrlen which directly affects flow (possible early return) and are therefore relevant to program behaviour. The sendto call (with MSG_DONTWAIT) is executed and its error handling (return OS_ERROR) is used. The return values (OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, and the sendto result) are used by callers. These operations are not dead code because removing them would alter program behaviour or observable outputs. The fragments reported above are selected because they can lead to code that has no effect in the built project (for example an empty OS_DEBUG macro removes the diagnostic call) or because the conditional compilation / macro usage can hide code or change whether code is present/used; those should be investigated further for possible dead-code violations under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
