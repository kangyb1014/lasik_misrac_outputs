  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The code does not contain any of the common compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm / asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, nested functions, __builtin_* intrinsics, pragmas that change language semantics, or other vendor-specific keywords. Specific points inspected and why they are not extensions:\n\n- The OS_CHECK_STRING macro uses a do { ... } while (0) wrapper \u2014 this is a standard portable macro idiom, not a language extension.\n- The sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) usage is valid because sizeof\u2019s operand is not evaluated; using a pointer member in sizeof does not require the object to be initialized and is standard C.\n- The explicit cast (void *)mountpoint removes const qualification via an explicit cast; this is normal C casting and not a compiler extension (though it may be questionable for const-correctness, it is not an extension).\n- The inline function (static inline ...) is standard C (C99 and later) and is not a compiler-specific extension.\n- All custom types (int32, uint8, osal_blockcount_t, OS_object_token_t, etc.) are typedefs and therefore not language extensions.\n- The macros and array indexing (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_filesys_table[..]) use standard C constructs only.\n\nBecause none of the above use compiler-specific extension features, there are no code fragments that need to be flagged for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (no language extensions). If you want, I can also check for other MISRA rules (e.g., const-correctness or possible uninitialized use) but those are outside Rule 1.2."
