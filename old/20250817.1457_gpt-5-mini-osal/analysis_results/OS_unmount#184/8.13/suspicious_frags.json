  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either already use const where appropriate or deliberately require a modifiable (non-const) pointer: the function parameter is declared const char * (correct for input data), the filesys pointer is used to modify the filesystem record (filesys->flags is written), OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl and OS_ObjectIdRelease operate on token or filesystem state and therefore legitimately take non-const pointers, and sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) is a compile-time size operation that does not involve modifying pointed-to data. The only places where a const-qualified input is explicitly cast away / passed into APIs that accept non-const (potentially violating 8.13) are the two fragments reported above."
