  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call to OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl(&token) is a no-op in the provided project (its implementation always returns OS_SUCCESS and has no side-effects). Removing this call would not change program behaviour, so the executed operation is redundant and therefore constitutes dead code.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_unmount code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1474.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_unmount as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_unmount:\n```c\nint32 OS_unmount(const char *mountpoint)\n{\n    int32                         return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t             token;\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_STRING(mountpoint, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt), OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint,\n                                         (void *)mountpoint, &token);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, token);\n\n        /*\n         * FIXED flag should always be unset (these don't support mount/unmount at all)\n         * READY flag should be set (mkfs/initfs must have been called on this FS)\n         * MOUNTED SYSTEM/VIRTUAL should always be unset.\n         *\n         * The FIXED flag is not enforced to support abstraction.\n         */\n        if ((filesys->flags & ~OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_FIXED) !=\n            (OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_READY | OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_SYSTEM | OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_VIRTUAL))\n        {\n            /* unmount() cannot be used on this file system at this time */\n            return_code = OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return_code = OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl(&token);\n        }\n\n        if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            /* mark as mounted in the local table.\n             * For now this does both sides (system and virtual) */\n            filesys->flags &= ~(OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_SYSTEM | OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_VIRTUAL);\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_unmount code.\n",
