  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Although the code later normalizes any non-success return_code to OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND, the assignment return_code = OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE; is not dead: it changes the intermediate return_code from OS_SUCCESS to a non-success value and thus affects control flow and side effects inside the function. Specifically, when the flags test indicates an incorrect state, setting return_code to an error prevents the subsequent \"if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\" block from executing (which would clear the MOUNTED flags) and prevents calling the unmount implementation. Removing that assignment would leave return_code as OS_SUCCESS, causing different behavior (clearing flags and returning OS_SUCCESS) before the final canonicalization \u2014 therefore removal would affect program behavior. Consequently this assignment is not dead code and there is no violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 in this respect."
