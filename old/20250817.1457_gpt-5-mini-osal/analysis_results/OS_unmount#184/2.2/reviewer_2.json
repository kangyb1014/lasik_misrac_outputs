  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The agent's claim is not supported by the observed behaviour. The test logs show the code never reaches the branch that calls OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl (no \"before_impl_call\"/\"after_impl_call\" entries appear); instead OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch returns an error and the function takes the early error path. Under the supplied (and stated exhaustive) tests the implementation call is not executed, so there is no executed operation whose removal would be behaviour-preserving. Even if the implementation were a no-op, MISRA Rule 2.2 concerns executed operations that could be removed without changing behaviour; unreachable code is explicitly not considered dead code. Therefore the report that OS_unmount violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
