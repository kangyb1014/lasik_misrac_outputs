  "explanation": "The rest of the code in OS_unmount and the related symbols should not be flagged for dead-code investigation because they perform active control-flow or visible side-effect work that can affect program behaviour: - The OS_CHECK_STRING macro validates the input and can return an error before further processing; it is a functional parameter check. - The call to OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch (and the search function OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint) perform the object lookup and determine whether the mountpoint matches; their results control whether the unmount sequence runs. - The use of the token and OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is required to obtain the filesys record; subsequent reads/writes to filesys->flags are visible state changes. - Clearing the mounted flags (filesys->flags &= ~(...)) updates the system-visible state and is not dead. - OS_ObjectIdRelease must be called to finish the object transaction and is a required side-effect. - Definitions of constants, table access macros, and index/token helpers (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_filesys_table, flag definitions, etc.) are structural and used by the control flow; they are not dead. In summary, only the listed fragments are suspicious with respect to potentially being dead (overwritten or no-op) given the supplied implementations; other code affects control flow or maintains visible state and therefore should not be treated as dead code."
