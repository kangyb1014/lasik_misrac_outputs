  "explanation": "The compile error occurred because OS_object_token_t is an aggregate (struct) type and cannot be cast to an integer for printing. I changed the log calls to print the address of the token structure using %p and (void *)&token instead of casting token to unsigned long/%lu. This preserves the original logic while avoiding invalid casts that caused the compiler error."
