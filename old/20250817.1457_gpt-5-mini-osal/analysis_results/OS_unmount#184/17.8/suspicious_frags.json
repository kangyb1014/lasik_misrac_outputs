  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the function do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 because they do not modify the function parameter itself: assignments to return_code, calls that pass other objects (e.g. &token), accesses and updates to filesys->flags (these modify the object pointed to by filesys, not the mountpoint parameter), OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token), and the final return are all operations that do not reassign or otherwise modify the mountpoint pointer variable. Rule 17.8 concerns modification of the pointer parameter (or reassigning it); the only locations that could plausibly affect that (macros or casts involving mountpoint) are the two fragments listed above, so other lines need not be investigated for this specific rule."
