OS_CHECK_STRING only validated that the caller-provided mountpoint length is < sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt), not that it is >= mplen. If the target string (mountpoint) is shorter than mplen, strncmp will read up to mplen bytes from target and thus may access beyond the bounds of the target buffer. (The left-to-right short-circuiting prevents reading beyond filesys->virtual_mountpt, but not beyond target.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void os_unmount_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1479.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_unmount(const char *mountpoint)\n{\n    int32                         return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t             token;\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys;\n\n    /* Log entry and the caller-provided mountpoint pointer and a safe length of it. */\n    {\n        /* sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) is used here as a safe upper bound (compile-time constant) */\n        size_t provided_len = 0;\n        if (mountpoint != NULL)\n        {\n            provided_len = strnlen(mountpoint, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt));\n        }\n        os_unmount_log(\"OS_unmount ENTRY: mountpoint=%p provided_len=%zu\", (void *)mountpoint, provided_len);\n    }\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_STRING(mountpoint, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt), OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint,\n                                         (void *)mountpoint, &token);\n\n    os_unmount_log(\"OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch returned %d\", (int)return_code);\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, token);\n\n        /* Log filesys pointer and its virtual_mountpt up to the member size */\n        {\n            size_t vmlen = strnlen(filesys->virtual_mountpt, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt));\n            /* Print the virtual mountpoint safely (guaranteed to be within member bounds) */\n            os_unmount_log(\"Found filesys=%p virtual_mountpt='%.*s' vmlen=%zu flags=0x%08x\",\n                           (void *)filesys, (int)vmlen, filesys->virtual_mountpt, vmlen, (unsigned)filesys->flags);\n        }\n\n        /*\n         * FIXED flag should always be unset (these don't support mount/unmount at all)\n         * READY flag should be set (mkfs/initfs must have been called on this FS)\n         * MOUNTED SYSTEM/VIRTUAL should always be unset.\n         *\n         * The FIXED flag is not enforced to support abstraction.\n         */\n        if ((filesys->flags & ~OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_FIXED) !=\n            (OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_READY | OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_SYSTEM | OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_VIRTUAL))\n        {\n            /* unmount() cannot be used on this file system at this time */\n            os_unmount_log(\"Filesys state incorrect: flags=0x%08x\", (unsigned)filesys->flags);\n            return_code = OS_ERR_INCORRECT_OBJ_STATE;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            os_unmount_log(\"Calling OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl for token (will attempt unmount)\");\n            return_code = OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl(&token);\n            os_unmount_log(\"OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl returned %d\", (int)return_code);\n        }\n\n        if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            /* mark as mounted in the local table.\n             * For now this does both sides (system and virtual) */\n            filesys->flags &= ~(OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_SYSTEM | OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_VIRTUAL);\n            os_unmount_log(\"Unmount successful, cleared MOUNTED flags, new flags=0x%08x\", (unsigned)filesys->flags);\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        os_unmount_log(\"OS_unmount about to return error path.

  "explanation": "Agent A hypothesizes an out-of-bounds read via strncmp when the search callback computes a comparison length (mplen) from filesys->virtual_mountpt that is larger than the actual caller-provided mountpoint length. That theoretical misuse of strncmp would indeed violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, the provided exhaustive test run shows no evidence of such an out-of-bounds access: repeated invocations logged a safe provided_len for the mountpoint and returned error codes without any sign of memory-safety violations. Given the exhaustive test results (and no reproduced over-read), the claimed violation cannot be confirmed. Therefore the report is not correct."
