Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, OS_count_sem_prop_t *count_prop)\n{\n    int                                 sval;\n    OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token);\n\n    if (sem_getvalue(&impl->id, &sval) < 0)\n    {\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    /* put the info into the structure */\n    count_prop->value = sval;\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nOS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t OS_impl_count_sem_table[OS_MAX_COUNT_SEMAPHORES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    sem_t id;\n} OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    char      name[OS_MAX_API_NAME];\n    osal_id_t creator;\n    int32     value;\n} OS_count_sem_prop_t\n...\n#define OS_SEM_FAILURE (-6)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nreturn OS_SUCCESS;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
