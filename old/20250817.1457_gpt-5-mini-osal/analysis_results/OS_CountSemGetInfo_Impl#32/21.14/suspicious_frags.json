  "explanation": "No use of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any other byte-wise comparison function) appears in the provided code fragments. The function OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl only calls sem_getvalue, accesses a semaphore id and integer sval, assigns to a numeric field, and returns status codes. The related symbols and types shown (OS_object_token_t, OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t, OS_impl_count_sem_table, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) do not contain any string handling or memcmp usage. Therefore there are no code locations in the supplied snippets that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp comparing null-terminated strings). If there are other macros or external functions (e.g. the definition of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) not provided here, they would need to be reviewed, but based on the supplied code no memcmp-based string comparisons exist."
