  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns use of string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). Neither the target function OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl nor any of the provided related definitions invoke any of these string.h functions. The function only calls sem_getvalue and assigns an integer into count_prop->value. The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken perform pointer/index operations but do not perform any string operations. The count semaphore property struct contains a char name[] member, but that member is not accessed or modified in the shown code. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided code that should be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. If string-handling operations occur elsewhere in the codebase (e.g. code that populates the name field or copies strings into other buffers), those locations would need review, but they are not present in the supplied snippets."
