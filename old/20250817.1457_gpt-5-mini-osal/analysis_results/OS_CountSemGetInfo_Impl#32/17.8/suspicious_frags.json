  "explanation": "No fragments in OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl modify a function parameter itself. The function parameters are: const OS_object_token_t *token and OS_count_sem_prop_t *count_prop. The code does not reassign either parameter (no statements like token = ... or count_prop = ...). The write to count_prop->value modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter, which is permitted by the rule (the pointer itself must not be modified, but the pointed-to object may be). The use of *token in the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro merely dereferences the token to index the object table and the macro takes the address of that dereferenced object; this does not reassign or modify the parameter token itself. All other operations (assigning to local variable impl, calling sem_getvalue with addresses of impl->id and local sval, returning status codes) operate on local variables or pointed-to objects and do not violate Rule 17.8. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for this rule."
