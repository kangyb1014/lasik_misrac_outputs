  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C constructs: local variable declarations, pointer dereference (*token), a macro invocation (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET), a POSIX API call (sem_getvalue), structure member access (count_prop->value), and integer return codes. None of these are language extensions such as inline assembly, GNU attributes or keywords (e.g. __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions, asm), compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, or other documented compiler extensions.\n\nNote: The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the typedefs (e.g., int32, OS_object_token_t) are not shown; a macro invocation or typedef name alone is not a language extension. If the macro or the typedefs expand to or are implemented using compiler-specific extensions, those expansions would need to be inspected \u2014 but based on the visible code there is no evidence of a language extension that must be reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
