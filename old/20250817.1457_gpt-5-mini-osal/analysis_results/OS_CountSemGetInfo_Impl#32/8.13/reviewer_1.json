Because a non-const pointer is used where a const-qualified pointer would suffice, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void os_countsem_log(const char *stage, const void *token_ptr, const void *impl_ptr, int sval)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/259.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Log the stage, token pointer, impl pointer, returned semaphore value (if available), and errno */\n        (void)fprintf(f, \"stage=%s token_ptr=%p impl_ptr=%p sval=%d errno=%d\\n\",\n                      stage, token_ptr, impl_ptr, sval, errno);\n        (void)fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nint32 OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, OS_count_sem_prop_t *count_prop)\n{\n    int                                 sval;\n    OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    /* Lookup the implementation record */\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token);\n\n    /* Log after lookup (do not dereference impl here) */\n    os_countsem_log(\"after_lookup\", token, (void *)impl, 0);\n\n    /* Log just before calling sem_getvalue */\n    os_countsem_log(\"before_sem_getvalue\", token, (void *)impl, 0);\n\n    if (sem_getvalue(&impl->id, &sval) < 0)\n    {\n        /* Log failure case with errno and sval (sval may be undefined on failure but logged for evidence) */\n        os_countsem_log(\"sem_getvalue_failed\", token, (void *)impl, sval);\n        return OS_SEM_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    /* Log success including the obtained semaphore value */\n    os_countsem_log(\"sem_getvalue_success\", token, (void *)impl, sval);\n\n    /* put the info into the structure */\n    count_prop->value = sval;\n\n    /* Log final success and returned value */\n    os_countsem_log(\"return_success\", token, (void *)impl, sval);\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_CountSemGetInfo_Impl.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Although impl is only read in this function, it cannot be declared as a pointer-to-const without causing problems when calling sem_getvalue. The POSIX prototype is int sem_getvalue(sem_t *sem, int *sval) \u2014 it requires a sem_t * (non-const). If impl were declared const OS_impl_countsem_internal_record_t *impl, then impl->id would be const sem_t and &impl->id would be const sem_t *, incompatible with sem_getvalue without an explicit cast. Forcing a const qualification here would therefore either require casting away const (which itself would violate other MISRA principles) or break the call. Also the object comes from the OS object table and is conceptually mutable. MISRA 8.13 asks for const when possible, but it is not possible in this context because of the required API (sem_getvalue) and the mutability of the underlying object. Thus the reported violation is incorrect."
