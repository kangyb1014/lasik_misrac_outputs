  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter token is already a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token) so it satisfies the rule; count_prop is an output parameter that is written to (count_prop->value = sval), so it must not be const; sval is a local int whose address is passed as an output argument to sem_getvalue, so it cannot be const. The sem_getvalue API expects a sem_t * for the semaphore object, so whether impl (the record pointer) could be const needs checking \u2014 hence the impl declaration, the table lookup that obtains impl, and the sem_getvalue call are reported for investigation. No other pointer usages in this function appear eligible to be made const without further context."
