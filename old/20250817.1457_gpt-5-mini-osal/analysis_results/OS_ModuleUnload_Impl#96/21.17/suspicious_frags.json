  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code. The shown operations are dynamic loader calls (dlerror, dlclose) and a logging macro (OS_DEBUG). dlerror/dlclose are not functions from <string.h>, and passing the dlerror() result to a printf-style \"%s\" does not invoke any of the listed <string.h> functions in this snippet. The implementation of OS_DEBUG is not shown; if it internally used any <string.h> functions on pointers originating from this code, that would need inspection, but there is no direct use of <string.h> APIs here to trigger Rule 21.17 concerns. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation under Rule 21.17."
