  "explanation": "No language/compiler-specific extensions are present in the provided code fragments. Specifically:\n\n- There are no explicit compiler-extension keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__/__inline__ (with double underscores), typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, or other vendor-specific builtins.\n- The use of static inline in the additional code is a standard C keyword (C99 and later) and not an explicit compiler extension in the shown context.\n- Calls to dlerror() and dlclose() are POSIX library functions, not language extensions; their presence does not indicate a compiler language extension.\n- The typedef-like identifiers (e.g. int32, OS_impl_module_internal_record_t, OS_object_token_t) and the macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) are user-defined types/macros \u2014 these are not inherently compiler language extensions. The macro definition is not shown; only a macro call appears in the code, so nothing in the call itself demonstrates a compiler-specific extension.\n\nBecause no compiler-specific extension tokens or constructs are visible in the supplied code, there are no code fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
