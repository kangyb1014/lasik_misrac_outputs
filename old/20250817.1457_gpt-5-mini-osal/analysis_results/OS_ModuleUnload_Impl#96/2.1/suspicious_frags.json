  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code is present in the provided function. Execution flows sequentially: status is initialized, impl is obtained, dlerror() is called, then either the if branch (dlclose == 0) or the else branch executes, and the function returns status. There are no statements after the return, no unconditional jumps or infinite loops, and no duplicated mutually exclusive conditions that render a branch impossible. Potential implementation-defined behaviors (not visible in this snippet) such as OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET or OS_DEBUG being macros that perform longjmp/terminate or expand to nothing do not create statically unreachable code in this function as shown; they may alter runtime/control-flow in some builds, but that is outside the scope of this snippet. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 2.1."
