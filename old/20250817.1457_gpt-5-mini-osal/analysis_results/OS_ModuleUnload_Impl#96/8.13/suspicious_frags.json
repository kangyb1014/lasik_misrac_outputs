  "explanation": "I have reported all code locations that involve pointers or pointer-valued members where const-qualification might be applicable or may be discarded (pointer declaration, use of table/macro to obtain an element, passing/assigning the dl_handle member, the struct member type, the macro that takes an address of its argument, and the external table declaration). Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter is already declared as a pointer to const (so it is const-qualified), local scalar 'status' is not a pointer, the standalone call 'dlerror();' used to clear error state does not involve pointer-type declarations or discarding constness, and the final 'return status;' is not pointer-related. The typedef for OS_object_token_t (opaque struct tag) and simple non-pointer statements in the body are not relevant to pointer const-qualification and therefore were not included."
