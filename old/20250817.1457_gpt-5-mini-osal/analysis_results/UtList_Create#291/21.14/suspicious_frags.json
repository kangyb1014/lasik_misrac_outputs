  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided function. The code does not perform any string operations or comparisons of null-terminated strings (no calls to memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, or manual byte-wise string comparisons). The function only allocates memory, zeroes it with memset, initializes numeric tag fields and next/prev pointers \u2014 none of which relate to Rule 21.14 (prohibiting memcmp for null-terminated string comparison). Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for this specific MISRA rule."
