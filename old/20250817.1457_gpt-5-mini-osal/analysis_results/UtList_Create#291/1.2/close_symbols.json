  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for language-extension use:\n\n- UtListHead_t: Need the full typedef/struct layout to see whether its definition uses any compiler extensions (e.g. attributes, nonstandard bit\u2011fields, flexible/zero-length arrays, anonymous structs/unions, packed attributes). The target function embeds and assigns to members of this type, so its definition is essential.\n\n- UtListNode_t: The flexible array member Tags[] and per-node initialisation depend on this type. Its definition may itself use language extensions (bitfields, attributes, unnamed members) that would violate the rule.\n\n- uint32: Determine whether this is a standard typedef (e.g. uint32_t) or a compiler-specific type/alias (or macro) introduced via an extension. The exact typedef/definition is needed to check for nonstandard types.\n\n- malloc (prototype / <stdlib.h>): Verify that the standard library prototype is visible (no implicit declaration). Some compilers permit implicit functions as an extension; also detect any nonstandard replacement or wrapper that uses extensions.\n\n- memset (prototype / <string.h>): Same rationale as malloc \u2014 ensure standard declaration is used and no implicit declaration or nonstandard extension is relied upon.\n\n- size_t (definition / <stddef.h> or <stdint.h>): Confirm size_t is the standard type and not redefined by a compiler extension or nonstandard header.\n\n- __STDC_VERSION__ (predefined macro): Needed to determine which C standard the translation unit is being compiled under. Flexible array members (Tags[]) are standard in C99 and later; under older standards some compilers treat them as extensions. Knowing __STDC_VERSION__ (or lack thereof) is required to decide if Tags[] is an extension in this build.\n\n- Compiler identification macros (e.g. __GNUC__, __clang__, _MSC_VER): Some compilers document that certain constructs (flexible arrays, nested struct definitions, attributes) are language extensions even if allowed by a given standard. These macros let an analyzer check the compiler/documentation for whether any used constructs are implemented as extensions.\n\n- Translation-unit compile options / -std=... and other compiler flags: The active language standard and flags (for example -std=c89, -std=c99, -pedantic, -fms-extensions, etc.) determine whether constructs such as flexible array members or implicit function declarations are treated as standard or as extensions. These options are required to make a definitive judgement about use of language extensions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (type definitions, standard declarations, predefined macros and compile flags) allows the next agent to determine whether any constructs in UtList_Create rely on compiler-specific extensions rather than standard C language features."
