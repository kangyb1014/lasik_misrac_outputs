  "explanation": "The primary potential source of unreachable code in this function is the lack of a check for malloc() failure. If malloc() returns NULL, all subsequent dereferences/uses of NewList may either be non-executable in a safe implementation or cause undefined behavior; therefore the allocation, the memset, the assignments to NewList->Head, the loop that initializes tags, and the final return need to be investigated to confirm there is no unreachable code path or undefined behaviour. Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.1: the local struct declaration and local variable declarations are ordinary compile-time constructs; the computation of ActualSize is a simple expression that will be evaluated and is not inherently unreachable; the for-loop header itself is normal (its body may legitimately be skipped when NumTags == 0, which is not unreachable code in the MISRA sense). These elements do not, by themselves, indicate unreachable code."
