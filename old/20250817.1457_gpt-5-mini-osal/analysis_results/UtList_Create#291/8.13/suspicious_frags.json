  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not selected because they do not introduce non-const pointer types that could plausibly be const-qualified, or they perform operations that necessarily require a mutable pointer. Specifically:\n- The struct definition lines and the flexible array member (UtListNode_t Tags[]) declare storage rather than pointers needing const qualification.\n- Computation of ActualSize, the sizeof expressions, and the memset call operate on sizes or raw memory and do not declare or propagate pointer types that could be const-qualified.\n- The assignment of numeric fields (e.g., NumberOfTags) and integer updates inside the loop (e.g., TagHead->Tag = i) modify scalar data, not pointer types.\n- The for-loop control (for (i = 0; i < NumTags; ++i)) and local scalar declarations (size_t ActualSize; uint32 i;) are unrelated to pointer const-qualification.\n\nThe selected fragments are the lines that introduce, return, or assign pointer-typed entities (function return pointer, local pointer variables, pointer returned from malloc, pointer field assignment, pointer arithmetic/indexing, pointer-to-node assignments, and the function return of an internal pointer). These are the locations that should be investigated to determine whether the pointed-to types could/should be const-qualified under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
