  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: NewList points to newly allocated, mutable memory that is subsequently modified (fields initialized and updated). Making this pointer const would prevent those modifications. A violation of Rule 8.13 would occur if the pointer were declared or used as pointing to a non-modifiable (const-qualified) object when modifications are intended \u2014 e.g. if NewList were declared as const struct ListAllocator *NewList while the code then wrote to its members."
