  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 concerns calls to <string.h> functions that may access memory beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The only use of a string/memory function in this function is the memset call; therefore the size computation that supplies the third parameter (ActualSize) and the allocation that must provide the memory region (malloc) are relevant and are reported above. Other fragments (struct definitions, assignment NewList->Head.Tags = NewList->Tags;, the loop that initializes TagHead elements, and the return of &NewList->Head) do not themselves invoke any <string.h> functions nor change the value passed to memset, and the loop index is already bounded by NumTags; thus they do not need separate investigation for compliance with Rule 21.17."
