  "explanation": "To determine whether UtList_Create modifies its parameter (MISRA rule: a function parameter shall not be modified) the next analyst needs the concrete definitions of the symbols that affect interpretation of the code:\n\n1) UtListHead_t (type/struct definition, including member: Tags, NumberOfTags)\n   - Required to know the types of Head.Tags and Head.NumberOfTags. If NumberOfTags were a macro, bit-field, or a pointer type (or otherwise aliasing the function parameter through unusual typedefs/macros), that could imply modification of the parameter. Knowing the exact member types confirms that assigning NewList->Head.NumberOfTags = NumTags writes into the newly allocated structure (allowed) and does not modify the function parameter itself.\n\n2) UtListNode_t (type/struct definition, including members: Tag, Next, Prev)\n   - Required to verify that the loop writes into elements of the newly allocated array (Tag, Next, Prev are members of UtListNode_t) and again does not alias or modify the function parameter. Also needed to confirm that TagHead->Next/Prev assignments modify node members, not some alias of the parameter.\n\n3) uint32 (typedef/define for the parameter type)\n   - Confirm the actual underlying type of the parameter. If uint32 were unexpectedly defined as some non-scalar (e.g. a macro or typedef to a pointer type), that could change whether writing to related objects may be considered modifying the parameter. This ensures NumTags is a normal scalar passed by value.\n\n4) malloc (prototype/definition)\n   - To confirm the semantics of the allocation and that NewList is an independently allocated object. This helps show assignments to NewList->Head.* modify newly allocated memory rather than the parameter. Also to ensure no macros wrap malloc in a way that could affect the parameter.\n\n5) memset (prototype/definition)\n   - To confirm that the zeroing call affects the newly allocated object only and does not implicitly modify the function parameter via side-effects (for example, if memset were a macro or replaced by a function with unusual semantics). This rules out hidden parameter modification.\n\n6) size_t (typedef/definition)\n   - To confirm sizeof usage is standard and to ensure no unusual typedef of size_t alters interpretation of the computations that allocate memory.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let the analyst confirm that all assignments in UtList_Create target the locally allocated 'NewList' object and its members, and that the formal parameter NumTags itself is not assigned to or otherwise modified. They also allow checking for any surprising typedefs or macros that could make an assignment appear to modify the parameter when it in fact modifies some aliased object."
