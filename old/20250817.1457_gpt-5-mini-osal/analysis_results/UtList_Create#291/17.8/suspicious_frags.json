  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter uint32 NumTags. There are no assignments to NumTags, no increments/decrements of NumTags, and it is only read (used in size calculation, assigned into NewList->Head.NumberOfTags, and used as the loop bound). There are no pointer parameters whose pointer values could be modified. All assignments in the code modify local variables (NewList, TagHead, i) or memory reachable via locally allocated pointers (NewList->Head, NewList->Tags, TagHead->Next/Prev/Tag), not the function parameter itself. Therefore no code fragments in this function violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and none need further investigation for that rule."
