Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_Create:\n```c\nUtListHead_t *UtList_Create(uint32 NumTags)\n{\n    struct ListAllocator\n    {\n        UtListHead_t Head;\n        UtListNode_t Tags[];\n    };\n    struct ListAllocator *NewList;\n    UtListNode_t *        TagHead;\n    size_t                ActualSize;\n    uint32                i;\n\n    ActualSize = sizeof(struct ListAllocator) + (sizeof(UtListNode_t) * NumTags);\n    NewList    = (struct ListAllocator *)malloc(ActualSize);\n\n    memset(NewList, 0, ActualSize);\n\n    NewList->Head.Tags         = NewList->Tags;\n    NewList->Head.NumberOfTags = NumTags;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < NumTags; ++i)\n    {\n        TagHead       = &NewList->Head.Tags[i];\n        TagHead->Tag  = i;\n        TagHead->Next = TagHead;\n        TagHead->Prev = TagHead;\n    }\n\n    return &NewList->Head;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemset(NewList, 0, ActualSize);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The call to memset(NewList, 0, ActualSize) is redundant: immediately after allocation the code assigns NewList->Head.Tags and NewList->Head.NumberOfTags, and the for-loop initializes every Tag node\u2019s Tag, Next and Prev fields. Therefore removing the memset would not change observable program behaviour (for both NumTags == 0 and NumTags > 0). Hence the memset is executed but unnecessary and constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note: the function also lacks a malloc(NULL) check, which is a separate safety issue.)"
