  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the call passes &iter to OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext, and an iterator get-next function is expected to modify the iterator state, so a non-const pointer is appropriate. Rule 8.13 requires const qualification only when the pointed-to object is not modified. (If, however, the called function does not modify the iterator but still takes a non-const pointer, that function signature would violate Rule 8.13 and should be changed to accept a pointer-to-const.)"
