  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer parameters that could be to const-qualified types. In this function the only places taking the address of a local object are the four calls above that pass &iter; each should be inspected to determine whether the callee actually modifies the iterator or could accept a pointer-to-const. There are no pointer declarations (e.g. T *p) or other address-of usages in this function to review. The scalar locals (return_code, close_code) and the non-pointer identifier OS_FileIteratorClose (a function pointer value passed as an argument) are not relevant for Rule 8.13 as written, so they need not be investigated here."
