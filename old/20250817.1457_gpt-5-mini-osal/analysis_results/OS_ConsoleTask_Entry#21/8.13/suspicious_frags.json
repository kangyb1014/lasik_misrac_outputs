  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer types or the pointer usage clearly requires a mutable (non-const) object due to API semantics. For example, simple local scalar declarations (e.g. token as a value type), the control-flow constructs (if/while), access to global state variables, and the final return do not present pointer-to-non-const issues. Additionally, some API calls necessarily operate on objects that are modified by the API (so a const-qualified pointer would be inappropriate), therefore those call-sites were not included as suspicious. The listed fragments are the points where non-const pointers or addresses are obtained/passed and therefore should be reviewed to determine whether the pointee types could be made const."
