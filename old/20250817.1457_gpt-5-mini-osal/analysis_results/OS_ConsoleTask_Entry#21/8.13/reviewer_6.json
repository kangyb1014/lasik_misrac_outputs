  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A is partially correct in principle (the parameter is not used to modify the pointed\u2011to object, so semantically a pointer-to-const would express intent), but in this specific code the non-const signature is almost certainly required by the thread-entry API. OS_ConsoleTask_Entry has the conventional pthread-like prototype (void *(*)(void *)) and is named as a task/entry routine; such APIs mandate the exact signature void *fn(void *). MISRA Rule 8.13 allows that the rule cannot be applied when the signature must match an external API. Therefore, as written, this is not a MISRA C:2023 violation unless the function is not used as a thread/task entry and the signature could be changed. Recommended actions: (a) if this is a thread entry, leave the signature but document the reason (or introduce an internal const-qualified pointer and use that), or (b) if it is not constrained by an external API, change the parameter to const void *arg. Given the likely thread-entry context, the report of a rule violation is not correct."
