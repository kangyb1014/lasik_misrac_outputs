  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function and the related definitions do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 because they perform observable or necessary actions: \n\n- The call to OS_ObjectIdGetById is required to validate the object id and establish the object token (acquiring locks/refcounts) and thus cannot be removed without changing program behaviour. \n\n- Declarations of local variables (local_arg, local, token) are used to hold inputs/results and to reference table entries; they are not dead. \n\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro is used to obtain records from global tables that are then accessed elsewhere; those accesses (reads/writes of buffer positions and semaphore operations) have side effects and are observable. \n\n- The implementations in the additional code (OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl, OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl, OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish, etc.) perform I/O, semaphore posts, lock/refcount management and global-state updates; these are side-effecting operations and thus not dead. \n\n- The overall token lifecycle (acquire via OS_ObjectIdGetById and release via OS_ObjectIdRelease) and the synchronization with sem_post in other code are part of the program's observable behaviour and should not be considered dead without further context. \n\nThe fragments listed in suspicious_frags are provided so they can be examined in detail for possible dead operations or questionable usages; all other code in the snippet exhibits clear, observable effects and therefore does not meet the definition of dead code under MISRA C Rule 2.2."
