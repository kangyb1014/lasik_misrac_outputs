  "explanation": "- struct timespec definition: needed to know the exact member names/types (tv_sec/tv_nsec) and whether any members are declared const or have special qualifiers \u2014 essential to decide if the function must (or must not) mutate the object and therefore whether the pointer could/should be const-qualified.  \n- uint32 typedef/definition: to confirm the integer type and ensure there are no qualifiers/type aliases that affect whether the function should modify the pointed object.  \n- OS_TimeBaseSet_Impl (prototype + implementation): this direct caller shows how OS_UsecToTimespec is invoked (what argument is passed: address of a local, a non-const object, or a const object). If the caller relies on the callee to write into the pointed object, the pointer must not be const.  \n- OS_TimeBaseSet (prototype/implementation): higher-level caller(s) can show broader usage patterns and whether callers ever pass const objects through the call chain \u2014 helps determine if const qualification would be compatible across callers.  \n- Declaration/prototype of OS_UsecToTimespec (if present): to see the public signature that other translation units may expect; if a header already declares a non-const or const pointer, that affects whether changing qualification is possible/appropriate.  \n- Any const-qualified uses of struct timespec in the codebase: finding existing const struct timespec * usages indicates whether treating the pointed object as read\u2011only is already assumed elsewhere; if callers pass const objects, that argues for making the parameter const (if feasible).  \n\nCollecting these symbols lets you determine whether the function actually modifies the pointee, how callers pass the argument, and whether changing/adding const would be safe and consistent \u2014 which is what the MISRA guideline requires to assess."
