  "explanation": "The only pointer in this function is the parameter 'struct timespec *time_spec'. The function writes to the pointed-to object (assigns tv_nsec and tv_sec), so the pointee must not be const \u2014 making it const would prevent the intended use. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-to-object usages in the code fragment. Therefore, under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible), there are no suspicious code fragments to investigate in this function."
