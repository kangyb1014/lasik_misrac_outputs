  "explanation": "To check the MISRA rule about modifying function parameters you must know whether the pointer parameter itself is being changed or only the object it points to, and whether the object/members are const-qualified. Specifically:\n- typedef uint32: ensures usecs is an integer type (not e.g. a pointer or some macro typedef) so you can rule out parameter reassignment or aliasing via an unusual typedef.\n- struct timespec (full definition): required to determine the exact member names, their types and whether they are declared const. If tv_sec/tv_nsec were const-qualified, assigning to them would be a modification of the pointed-to object (and likely a compile error) relevant to the rule.\n- declaration/prototype of OS_UsecToTimespec: an external prototype in a header could add qualifiers (e.g. making the pointer parameter const) that would change whether modifying the pointee is allowed; the definition must match the visible prototype for MISRA analysis.\n- any macros/defines for tv_sec, tv_nsec or time_spec: a macro could change semantics (rename or hide members or replace time_spec with something that causes the pointer itself to be reassigned). These must be checked to ensure the observed 'time_spec->tv_x' are plain member writes and that the pointer variable itself is not being modified."
