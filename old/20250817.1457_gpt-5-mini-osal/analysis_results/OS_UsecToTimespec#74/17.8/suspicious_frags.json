  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function has two parameters: a value parameter (uint32 usecs) and a pointer parameter (struct timespec *time_spec). The code does not assign to or rebind either parameter variable itself \u2014 there are no statements like \"usecs = ...\" or \"time_spec = ...\". The code only writes into the object pointed to by time_spec via time_spec->tv_nsec and time_spec->tv_sec; modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8, while modifying the pointer itself would be forbidden. Therefore no fragment in the provided function requires investigation under Rule 17.8 (note: other concerns such as null-pointer dereference or arithmetic overflow are outside this rule)."
