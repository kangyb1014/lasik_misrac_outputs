  "explanation": "1) uint32 (typedef/declaration): The identifier uint32 is not a standard C type name (the standard name is uint32_t). You must see its typedef to determine whether it is a plain standard integer typedef or a compiler-specific extension/type (or defined via a macro that uses an extension). If uint32 is implemented via a compiler builtin, bitfield hack, or a macro that expands to an extension, that would violate the MISRA rule.  \n2) struct timespec (complete definition): The function writes into members tv_sec and tv_nsec. You need the exact struct definition (types of members and any attached attributes) to check whether the struct or its members use non\u2011standard extensions (e.g. GCC attributes, non\u2011standard bitfields, non\u2011portable types or vendor-specific typedefs).  \n3) Translation-unit headers and #defines that introduce/alias those types or rename keywords: Any #include or #define in the translation unit that defines uint32, struct timespec, or that redefines language keywords (rare but possible) must be inspected to detect macro tricks or keyword redefinitions which are language extensions.  \n4) Any compiler-specific attribute/extension macros used in the TU (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, __extension__): Even if the typedefs/structs look ordinary, they may be annotated with compiler-specific attributes or created via macros that use __attribute__ / __declspec / __extension__. Those annotations are explicit language extensions and must be checked.  \nProviding these symbols (typedef/struct definitions and the TU-level macros/includes/attributes) is sufficient to determine whether OS_UsecToTimespec itself or the types it manipulates rely on compiler language extensions."
