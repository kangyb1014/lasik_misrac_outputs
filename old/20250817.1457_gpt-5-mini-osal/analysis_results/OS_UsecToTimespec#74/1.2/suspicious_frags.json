  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided function. The code uses only standard C constructs: static function specifier, if/else, integer arithmetic and struct member access. There are no GCC/Clang/MSVC extension tokens such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions, designated operand extensions, anonymous structs/unions, extended integer types (e.g. __int128), or other vendor-specific keywords. The identifier uint32 appears to be a typedef (not a language extension) and its definition would need to be reviewed separately to ensure it is not a compiler-specific extension; the code fragment itself does not use any extension. Likewise, struct timespec is a POSIX type (a library/OS definition), not a language/compiler extension. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that require investigation for Rule 1.2."
