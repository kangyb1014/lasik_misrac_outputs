  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present. The function contains only integer arithmetic and direct assignments to members of the struct timespec pointed to by time_spec. It does not call any of the <string.h> functions listed by Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), nor does it perform any pointer arithmetic or array indexing that would relate to string-buffer accesses. Therefore there are no code locations here that could violate Rule 21.17. (Note: other issues such as checking time_spec for NULL or integer overflow on usecs*1000 are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
