  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function appears to be unreachable. The if/else is based on the runtime value of the unsigned parameter 'usecs' compared to 1,000,000; both outcomes are possible for a uint32 (values < 1,000,000 and values >= 1,000,000), so neither branch is inherently unreachable. There are no compile-time constant conditions, no preceding unconditional returns or gotos that would skip code, and no preprocessor constructs in the shown code that would eliminate a branch. The arithmetic (multiplication, division, modulus) does not make either branch impossible to reach. Therefore no fragments require investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) in this function."
