  "explanation": "No use of the C library function memcmp or any string-comparison operations appear in the provided function. The code only performs integer arithmetic on a uint32 parameter and assigns results into members of a struct timespec; there are no char* or null-terminated string objects, no calls to memcmp, strcmp, or similar, and no buffer comparisons. Therefore there are no fragments relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 to investigate in this code."
