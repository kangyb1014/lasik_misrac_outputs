  "explanation": "No pointer declarations or pointer usages are present in the provided code fragment. The function signature is void OS_API_Teardown(void) (no parameters), and the two calls inside the function are OS_DeleteAllObjects() and OS_ApplicationShutdown(true). Neither call passes pointer arguments in this snippet, and the literal true is not a pointer. Therefore there are no in-scope code locations in this fragment that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (Note: the definitions or prototypes of OS_DeleteAllObjects and OS_ApplicationShutdown are not shown; if those functions accept pointer parameters, their declarations/implementations should be inspected separately, but those are outside the provided code fragment.)"
