  "explanation": "No function parameters are modified in the provided code fragments. Details:\n\n- OS_API_Teardown(void): has no parameters.\n\n- OS_DeleteAllObjects(void): has no parameters; local variables (ObjectCount, TryCount) are modified, not parameters.\n\n- OS_ApplicationShutdown(uint8 flag): the parameter 'flag' is only read (compared to true) and never assigned to or otherwise modified. Writing to global OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState and calling OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl() do not modify the parameter itself.\n\n- OS_ApplicationShutdown_Impl(void): has no parameters.\n\n- UT_ExecuteBasicHandler(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey, const char *FunctionName, UT_HandlerFunc_t DefaultHandler): the parameters are only read (checked against NULL, passed to other functions); there are no assignments to these parameter variables. Passing &ObjectCount to OS_CleanUpObject in OS_DeleteAllObjects is permitted because the pointer parameter itself is not reassigned here \u2014 only the object it points to may be modified (which is allowed by Rule 17.8).\n\nTherefore, there are no code fragments in the supplied code that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (modification of function parameters)."
