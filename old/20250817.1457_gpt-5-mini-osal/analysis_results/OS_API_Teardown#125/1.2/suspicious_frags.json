  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragments. I inspected for common vendor-specific extensions and constructs that would require further investigation, such as: __attribute__ or other __...__ identifiers, asm statements, nested functions, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), labels-as-values, zero-length arrays, GNU designated-initializer variants, or other known compiler-specific tokens \u2014 none appear. The uses that might look platform-specific are standard C/POSIX usage (e.g. kill(getpid(), SIGHUP) is a POSIX system call, not a language extension), simple pointer/loop arithmetic, standard boolean usage (while (true) / comparisons with true \u2014 from stdbool.h in standard C), and typedefs like uint32/uint8 which are ordinary type aliases. Therefore there are no fragments to flag under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
