  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_NewNode:\n```c\nUtListNode_t *UtList_NewNode(void *Data, uint32 DataSize)\n{\n    union NodeAllocator\n    {\n        UtListNode_t Node;\n        double       AlignDbl;\n        void *       AlignPtr;\n        long         AlignLong;\n    } * AllocNode;\n\n    AllocNode = malloc(sizeof(union NodeAllocator) + DataSize);\n    memset(AllocNode, 0, sizeof(union NodeAllocator));\n    AllocNode->Node.Data     = &AllocNode[1];\n    AllocNode->Node.DataSize = DataSize;\n    memcpy(AllocNode->Node.Data, Data, DataSize);\n\n    AllocNode->Node.Next = &AllocNode->Node;\n    AllocNode->Node.Prev = &AllocNode->Node;\n\n    return &AllocNode->Node;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nvoid *       AlignPtr;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment is a union member declaration (void *AlignPtr;) used to influence object layout/alignment; it is not an executed operation. Rule 2.2 applies to executed operations whose removal would not affect behavior. Removing this member could change alignment/size and therefore program behaviour on some platforms, so it is not dead code."
