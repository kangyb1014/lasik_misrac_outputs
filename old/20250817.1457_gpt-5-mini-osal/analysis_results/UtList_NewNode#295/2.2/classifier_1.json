  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_NewNode:\n```c\nUtListNode_t *UtList_NewNode(void *Data, uint32 DataSize)\n{\n    union NodeAllocator\n    {\n        UtListNode_t Node;\n        double       AlignDbl;\n        void *       AlignPtr;\n        long         AlignLong;\n    } * AllocNode;\n\n    AllocNode = malloc(sizeof(union NodeAllocator) + DataSize);\n    memset(AllocNode, 0, sizeof(union NodeAllocator));\n    AllocNode->Node.Data     = &AllocNode[1];\n    AllocNode->Node.DataSize = DataSize;\n    memcpy(AllocNode->Node.Data, Data, DataSize);\n\n    AllocNode->Node.Next = &AllocNode->Node;\n    AllocNode->Node.Prev = &AllocNode->Node;\n\n    return &AllocNode->Node;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nlong         AlignLong;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The union member 'long AlignLong;' is a type/shape declaration that can affect the sizeof and alignment of union NodeAllocator. Removing it could change sizeof(union NodeAllocator) and thus the amount/allocation alignment used by malloc and the layout of the returned node, which may alter program behaviour on some platforms. Also, the declaration is not an executed operation (so it is not 'dead code' per Rule 2.2). Therefore this line does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
