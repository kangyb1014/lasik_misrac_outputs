  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_NewNode:\n```c\nUtListNode_t *UtList_NewNode(void *Data, uint32 DataSize)\n{\n    union NodeAllocator\n    {\n        UtListNode_t Node;\n        double       AlignDbl;\n        void *       AlignPtr;\n        long         AlignLong;\n    } * AllocNode;\n\n    AllocNode = malloc(sizeof(union NodeAllocator) + DataSize);\n    memset(AllocNode, 0, sizeof(union NodeAllocator));\n    AllocNode->Node.Data     = &AllocNode[1];\n    AllocNode->Node.DataSize = DataSize;\n    memcpy(AllocNode->Node.Data, Data, DataSize);\n\n    AllocNode->Node.Next = &AllocNode->Node;\n    AllocNode->Node.Prev = &AllocNode->Node;\n\n    return &AllocNode->Node;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmemset(AllocNode, 0, sizeof(union NodeAllocator));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The memset call writes zeros into the union area but immediately thereafter every meaningful member of UtListNode_t is overwritten: Node.Data, Node.DataSize, the payload bytes (via memcpy), and Node.Next/Node.Prev. If UtListNode_t contains only those members (no other fields that must be zero-initialized and no code that reads any bytes of the union before they are explicitly written), then removing the memset would not change program behaviour \u2014 so the memset is dead code and Rule 2.2 is violated. (If, however, UtListNode_t has other members or code later depends on those bytes being zero, the memset would be required and not dead.)"
