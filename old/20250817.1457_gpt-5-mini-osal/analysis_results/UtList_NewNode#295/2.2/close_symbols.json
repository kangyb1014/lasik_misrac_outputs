  "explanation": "To decide whether any operation in UtList_NewNode is dead code you must know how the node and its memory are used after creation and the precise semantics of the standard-library calls used inside the function. For each symbol:\n\n- UtListNode_t (typedef/struct definition): The function assigns to Node.Data, Node.DataSize, Node.Next and Node.Prev. Whether e.g. memset(AllocNode,0,...) or the memcpy are redundant depends on which fields and padding bytes of UtListNode_t (and the layout of the trailing data buffer) are later read. You need the full struct definition (field order, types, sizes, and any compiler padding/packing attributes) to determine whether earlier zeroing or later writes cover all bytes that will be observed.\n\n- malloc (prototype / semantics): The allocation behavior (return value on failure, alignment guarantees, and whether the allocator can return suitably aligned memory for the stored types) affects whether the code must check for NULL and whether assumptions about alignment/padding are valid. If removal of malloc changes behaviour (e.g. replacing with a static node) that matters for the MISRA dead-code determination.\n\n- memset (prototype / semantics): You must know what memset actually does here (zeroing size bytes starting at AllocNode) to judge if it affects program behaviour. If later code relies on zeroed padding, trailing bytes, or any union-member other than Node, memset might be required and not dead code. Conversely, if every byte that can be observed is overwritten later, memset could be dead; proving that requires examining readers.\n\n- memcpy (prototype / semantics): memcpy copies DataSize bytes to the node's trailing data. To judge whether memcpy is necessary (versus leaving that buffer zeroed or uninitialized) you must see how/when that data is read afterwards (do readers only look at a prefix, do they expect a copy rather than aliasing, etc.).\n\n- UtList_Add (caller implementation): UtList_Add calls UtList_NewNode and then uses the returned node. You must inspect how UtList_Add uses the node (which fields it reads, whether it expects Next/Prev to be self-referential, whether it later overwrites fields, whether it requires the data copy) to decide whether any writes in UtList_NewNode are redundant.\n\n- UtList_GetHead and UtList_Insert_Before (implementations): These are callees of UtList_Add and may also read or manipulate fields initialized here (Next/Prev pointer setup). For example, if Insert_Before overwrites Next/Prev unconditionally, the initial self-pointing assignment in NewNode may be redundant; if GetHead relies on the initial value, it is not. You must see their behaviour to prove or disprove redundancy.\n\n- UtTest_AddCommon (caller of UtList_Add and data origin): This higher-level caller (and callers upstream) supplies the Data and DataSize arguments. You need to know what Data points to (temporary stack buffer, const data, or volatile memory) and whether callers reuse that buffer after NewNode returns \u2014 which determines whether copying (memcpy) is required or could be removed.\n\n- All other functions / call sites that read UtListNode_t->Data or UtListNode_t->DataSize (readers): Any code which later reads the node's data buffer or size may rely on bytes that were zeroed by memset or rely on the copy performed by memcpy. To prove memset or memcpy are dead you must examine every reader to show the bytes written by those calls are never observed. Without listing/inspecting those readers you cannot soundly conclude the writes are dead.\n\nIn short: to decide whether the memset, memcpy, or the initial Next/Prev self-link assignments are dead you must inspect the UtListNode_t layout and every consumer of the node (direct callers in the provided call graph and any other readers) and understand the behavior/semantics of malloc/memset/memcpy. The listed symbols are the minimal set required to perform that analysis."
