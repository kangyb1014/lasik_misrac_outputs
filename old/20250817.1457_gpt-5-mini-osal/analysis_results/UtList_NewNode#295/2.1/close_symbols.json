  "explanation": "- UtList_Add: Direct caller of UtList_NewNode (present in the static call graph). To decide if UtList_NewNode is reachable you must examine UtList_Add\u2019s control flow and call sites.\\n- UtList_GetHead and UtList_Insert_Before: Callees of UtList_Add shown in the call graph; their control flow in combination with UtList_Add may affect whether the path that calls UtList_NewNode is ever taken (e.g. conditional/early returns).\\n- UtTest_AddCommon: Caller of UtList_Add (call-graph root shown). You must check this higher-level caller (and its call conditions) to determine whether the chain leading to UtList_NewNode is reachable from the test harness.\\n- main (program entry / other test harness entry points): To decide global reachability (MISRA\u2019s \u201cno unreachable code\u201d is project-wide) you need the actual program entry points that start call chains to determine if any caller chain to UtList_NewNode exists.\\n- UtListNode_t (typedef/struct) and uint32 (typedef): Type definitions can affect whether the function is conditionally compiled or has differing linkage/overloads in other translation units; also needed to confirm the function signature and that the function as written is the same symbol other units would call.\\n- malloc, memset, memcpy: Standard-library calls used by UtList_NewNode. While they do not affect whether the function is reachable, their presence can introduce error paths (e.g. NULL return from malloc) that could make following statements unreachable at runtime; for a conservative MISRA static reachability analysis you must know whether these are mapped to macros or replaced/removed by the build (which could change code reachability).\\n\nIn short: to determine whether UtList_NewNode contains unreachable code you must analyze callers up the call chain to program entry (UtList_Add, its callees, UtTest_AddCommon, main) and confirm the type and linkage information (UtListNode_t, uint32) and any library/macro replacements that could alter the function body (malloc/memset/memcpy)."
