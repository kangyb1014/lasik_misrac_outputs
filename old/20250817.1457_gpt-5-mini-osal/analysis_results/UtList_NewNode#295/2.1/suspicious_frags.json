  "explanation": "I did not find any code fragments that are provably unreachable (i.e., code that cannot be executed under any normal control flow) in the provided snippets. Rationale for not flagging other fragments: \n\n- UtList_NewNode: All statements are reachable in normal execution order. Although malloc() is not checked for NULL (which is a robustness/defensive programming defect), that yields undefined behavior on allocation failure rather than clearly unreachable code; no branch/statement is syntactically or logically impossible to reach. There are no statements following an unconditional return, no code guarded by constants that make it dead (e.g., if (0)), and no mutually exclusive conditions that render a block unreachable.\n\n- UtList_Add / UtList_GetHead: The early return in UtList_GetHead (return NULL when Tag >= NumberOfTags) is a legitimate reachable branch, and the subsequent return of &ListHead->Tags[Tag] is reachable when the condition is false. UtList_Add correctly checks the returned pointer (TagHead != NULL) before executing the insertion path; both branches are reachable depending on inputs.\n\n- UtList_Insert_Before: All four assignment statements are part of the insertion algorithm and are reachable when the function is called with valid node pointers. There is no dead code here.\n\n- UtTest_AddCommon: All statements (including the conditional strncpy) are reachable depending on TestName and the surrounding state; lock/unlock calls are executed in sequence.\n\nBecause no fragment is provably unreachable, I return an empty list. If you want, I can instead flag potential robustness issues (e.g., missing malloc NULL check, possible buffer issues with strncpy) that might lead to runtime faults, but those are not instances of unreachable code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
