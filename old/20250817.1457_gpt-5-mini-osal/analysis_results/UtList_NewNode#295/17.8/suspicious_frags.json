  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies either function parameter itself. The pointer parameter Data is only read (passed to memcpy) and its pointed-to object is copied into newly allocated storage \u2014 modifying the pointee is allowed by the rule. The scalar parameter DataSize is only used as an rvalue to size allocations and assignments into the node structure; it is not assigned to or otherwise modified. No statements reassign Data or DataSize (no increments, no assignments), so there is no apparent violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided code."
