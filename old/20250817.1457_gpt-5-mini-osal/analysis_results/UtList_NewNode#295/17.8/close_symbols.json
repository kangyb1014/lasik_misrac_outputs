  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: need the structure definition to know the type and meaning of the Node.Data member (is it a pointer, what it points to) and to check for any aliasing relationship between the new node\u2019s storage and the incoming parameter Data. This shows whether assignments to Node.Data or writes into the node could be changing the object referred to by the parameter pointer (allowed) or the parameter itself (forbidden).  \n- uint32: need the typedef to confirm DataSize is an integer by-value parameter (so the function cannot legally change the caller\u2019s variable) and to check any conversion behavior when passed to size/allocator functions.  \n- malloc: prototype/semantics are required to confirm it returns a pointer and does not modify the function parameters, and to reason about the memory returned (location/ownership) so we can determine whether writes later in the function could alias the input Data.  \n- memset: prototype/semantics to confirm it writes into the allocated buffer only and does not modify the pointer parameter Data.  \n- memcpy: prototype/semantics (especially which argument is source vs destination and that it does not modify pointer arguments) to determine whether the call alters the object pointed to by Data (allowed) or might modify the pointer parameter itself (not done by standard memcpy). Also to reason about potential overlap/aliasing between source and destination.  \n- Any project-specific macros or alternative implementations that override memcpy/memset/malloc: if these symbols are redefined in the project (macros or wrappers with different semantics), their actual definitions are required because they could conceivably modify pointer parameters or have side effects that would affect compliance with the MISRA rule."
