  "explanation": "The MISRA Rule 21.17 concerns uses of the <string.h> functions that may access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The listed fragments use malloc/memset/memcpy/strncpy (string.h functions) and therefore need investigation for potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds or NULL pointer usage, integer overflow in size calculations, and validity/size of the source/destination objects.\n\nWhy other fragments are not reported:\n- AllocNode->Node.Data     = &AllocNode[1]; and subsequent assignments to Node members (DataSize, Next, Prev, Tag) do not call any <string.h> functions and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.\n- return &AllocNode->Node; is a pointer return, not a string operation, so not relevant to this rule.\n- memset(&UtTestDataBaseEntry, 0, sizeof(UtTestDataBaseEntry)); is writing into a locally declared object whose address and size are known at the call site, so it does not present a string.h buffer-overrun concern under Rule 21.17 (the memset call itself is safe provided the object exists, which it does here).\n- UtList_Add, UtList_GetHead, UtList_Insert_Before and the locking calls do not themselves invoke the string.h functions that this rule targets, so they are not directly relevant; their interactions should be examined only insofar as they provide pointers/lengths to the flagged memcpy/strncpy/memset/malloc usage."
