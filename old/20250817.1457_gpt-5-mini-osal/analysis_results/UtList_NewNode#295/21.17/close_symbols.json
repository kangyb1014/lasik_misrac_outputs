  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t: The function accesses AllocNode->Node.Data and AllocNode->Node.DataSize. The struct definition is required to know the types, sizes and offsets of these fields (especially Data and DataSize) to determine where memcpy writes and whether those fields or other struct bytes can be overwritten or cause mis-sized copies.\n- uint32 (typedef): DataSize is of type uint32 in the function signature. The exact underlying integer type is needed to check conversion rules and whether any implicit narrowing/extension influences the amount of memory requested/passed to memcpy/malloc.\n- UtList_Add: This is the direct caller of UtList_NewNode. Its implementation (call sites) is required to see what values are passed as Data and DataSize (valid ranges, possible zero, or pointers that could alias the destination) to determine whether memcpy can legally copy DataSize bytes from Data.\n- UtTest_AddCommon: According to the call graph this calls UtList_Add. Examining it can reveal test/usage patterns and invariants (e.g., constant sizes, NULL checks) that affect whether Data/DataSize can cause out-of-bounds access in NewNode.\n- malloc (stdlib): The allocation size and behavior of malloc are critical. You must confirm that malloc will return at least (sizeof(union NodeAllocator) + DataSize) bytes (or NULL) and understand semantics on failure so you can reason about whether subsequent memset/memcpy access is within the allocated object.\n- memcpy (string.h): The MISRA rule targets memcpy. You need the exact semantics (number-of-bytes copied, UB on overlapping source/destination, behavior when size is zero, and pointer validity requirements) to decide if memcpy(AllocNode->Node.Data, Data, DataSize) can read/write beyond object bounds.\n- memset (string.h): memset is used to initialize the header portion. Knowing its semantics (bytes set, pointer validity) is necessary to check that memset(AllocNode, 0, sizeof(union NodeAllocator)) does not write beyond the allocated object when combined with the malloc size.\n- size_t (typedef): malloc/memcpy/memset use size_t for size arguments. Knowing the definition and width of size_t on the target platform is needed to reason about integer conversions from uint32 and any potential truncation/overflow when computing sizeof(union)+DataSize.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine (1) how many bytes are allocated, (2) where the destination pointer (&AllocNode[1]) points, (3) how many bytes memcpy writes, (4) whether source Data is valid for that many bytes or could alias the destination, and (5) whether integer conversions could make the allocation or copy sizes incorrect \u2014 all necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA string-handling bounds rule."
