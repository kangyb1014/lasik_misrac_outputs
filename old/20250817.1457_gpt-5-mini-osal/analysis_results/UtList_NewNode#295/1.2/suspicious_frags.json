  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- The local union type declaration (union NodeAllocator { ... } *AllocNode;) is standard C and not an extension.\n- Allocation with malloc, zeroing with memset, and copying with memcpy are standard library uses, not language extensions.\n- Pointer arithmetic (&AllocNode[1]) to access memory immediately following an allocated object is valid C (though a design choice, it is not a compiler language extension).\n- The alignment trick (including double, pointer, long members in the union) is a portable technique to obtain suitable alignment and is not a language extension.\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords (for example: __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, inline assembly, or other vendor extensions) present.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (prohibition of language extensions). If you want, I can additionally point out portability or safety concerns (e.g., error handling for malloc, memset size uses, strict-aliasing considerations), but those are not related to language extensions and thus outside Rule 1.2."
