  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t (complete struct/typedef): The function returns UtListNode_t* and assigns to its members (Data, DataSize, Next, Prev). You must see the exact type of the Data member (e.g. void * vs const void *) and other member types to decide whether the Data pointer should be const-qualified.\n- UtList_Add (definition): Caller of UtList_NewNode; examine how the returned node and its Data field are used (read-only vs written) to determine whether the Data pointer can be const.\n- UtList_GetHead (definition): Listed as a callee of UtList_Add in the call graph and likely to access node pointers; needed to check any reads/writes through node->Data or other node fields that affect const qualification.\n- UtList_Insert_Before (definition): Another list-manipulation function called by UtList_Add; it may modify node links or node data and so could require non-const Data pointers \u2014 must be checked.\n- UtTest_AddCommon (definition): Higher-level caller (per call graph). Inspecting its use can reveal whether callers ever modify the node->Data through the stored pointer, which would prevent adding const qualification.\n- uint32 (typedef): The parameter DataSize uses uint32; need the typedef to confirm signedness/size semantics and whether any implicit casts/assignments affect const-qualification analysis.\n- memcpy (prototype): The source parameter of memcpy is declared as const void * in the standard library. Confirming the prototype used by the project clarifies that the incoming Data could be const and is only read by the function.\n- malloc (prototype): To confirm return type (void *) and ownership semantics (allocation) so we can verify that node->Data points to an owned, mutable buffer (the allocated copy), not to the incoming Data pointer \u2014 relevant to whether the stored Data field itself must be const-qualified.\n- memset (prototype): Used to zero the allocator union; knowing its prototype and usage is helpful to confirm no writes are performed through the input Data pointer and to reason about initialization.\n\nIncluding these symbols allows the next analyst to (1) determine the declared type of node->Data, (2) find all places that read or write through that pointer, and (3) decide whether the pointer parameter and/or the stored Data pointer should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
