    "memcpy(AllocNode->Node.Data, Data, DataSize);",

    "UtListNode_t *UtList_NewNode(void *Data, uint32 DataSize)"
  ],
  "explanation": "The parameter Data is only read (copied) and is not modified in the function, so its declaration (void *Data) should be checked to determine whether it should be const-qualified (e.g. const void *Data). The assignment to Node.Data and the memcpy use of Data are directly related to that parameter and should be reviewed together to see if the pointer types in the API and node structure could/should be const-qualified.\n\nOther fragments need not be investigated for Rule 8.13: AllocNode is allocated and modified so it must be a non-const pointer; the union alignment members (AlignDbl, AlignPtr, AlignLong) are present for alignment and are not candidates for const qualification in this context; malloc/memset operate on newly allocated, mutable storage and thus require non-const pointers; Node.Next and Node.Prev are linked-list pointers that are assigned and expected to be mutable; the function return type UtListNode_t * returns a mutable node. These uses require non-const pointers, so they do not violate or implicate Rule 8.13."
