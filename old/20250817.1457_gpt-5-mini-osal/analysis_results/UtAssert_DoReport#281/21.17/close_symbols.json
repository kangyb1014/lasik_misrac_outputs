  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed for the MISRA C string-bounds analysis:\n\n1) strlen\n- UtAssert_DoReport calls strlen(File). strlen reads memory until a NUL byte; to determine whether this can access beyond the bounds of the object referenced by File you must know strlen semantics and whether File is guaranteed non-NULL and NUL-terminated at all call sites.\n\n2) snprintf\n- The function writes formatted data into the local ReportBuffer using a size limit. Although snprintf is bounded, its exact semantics (how many bytes it writes and NUL-terminates) are required to reason about whether ReportBuffer can be overflowed or whether truncation could mask earlier out-of-bounds reads. Also format/argument interactions (e.g., types of the formatted values and pointers passed as %s) must be validated to avoid undefined behaviour that could result in invalid accesses.\n\n3) UtAssertEx (caller)\n- UtAssertEx is the caller of UtAssert_DoReport. To determine if strlen(File) is safe you must inspect UtAssertEx to see what it passes for File (e.g., __FILE__, a possibly NULL or non-NUL-terminated buffer, or a dynamically built string). You must also inspect how ShortDesc and SubsysName are supplied (they become snprintf arguments) to assess any risk of invalid pointer parameters being passed to string-handling/formatting functions.\n\n4) UT_BSP_DoText (callee)\n- UtAssert_DoReport passes ReportBuffer to UT_BSP_DoText. UT_BSP_DoText (and the functions it calls) may call string.h routines on that pointer or otherwise read/write it. To fully assess whether any string-handling operation in the overall call-chain can access out-of-bounds memory you must examine UT_BSP_DoText implementation and its use of ReportBuffer.\n\n5) typedefs uint32/uint8\n- The code formats SegmentNum/TestSeq/LineNum with %u. The exact typedefs/sizes for uint32/uint8 are required to ensure correct printf-type matching (mismatched printf specifiers can cause undefined behaviour and thus potential invalid memory accesses) and to reason about value ranges used in formatting.\n\nNote: These symbols together let the next analyst (a) confirm that File is non-NULL and NUL-terminated at all call sites before strlen is used, (b) validate that snprintf usage cannot overflow ReportBuffer and that supplied %s pointers are valid, and (c) check downstream uses of ReportBuffer that might invoke other string.h functions."
