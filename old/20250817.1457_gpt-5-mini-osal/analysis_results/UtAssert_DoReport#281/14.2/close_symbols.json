Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for MISRA C 'for loop shall be well-formed' analysis:\n\n- strlen\n  - The target function calls strlen(File). strlen could be a macro or wrapper; to be certain there are no hidden for-loops or side effects that might affect any for-loop analysis in this translation unit, inspect its definition/implementation.\n\n- snprintf\n  - The function uses snprintf to build ReportBuffer. snprintf may be a macro/wrapper that could contain for-loops or modify objects; if a for-loop in this function (or inlined macro) existed it would need to be analysed as part of any for-loop body that calls it.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText\n  - UtAssert_DoReport directly calls UT_BSP_DoText. If the target function contained a for-loop that invoked UT_BSP_DoText (or if UT_BSP_DoText is a macro inlined into a loop), the behaviour of that for-loop's body includes UT_BSP_DoText. Therefore UT_BSP_DoText must be examined for any for-loops or side effects on loop counters/objects used in clauses.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock, UT_BSP_Unlock, OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl, OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl, OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl, UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev\n  - These are the reported callees of UT_BSP_DoText (per the static call graph). If UT_BSP_DoText is inlined or calls into these functions from within a for-loop context, those functions must be inspected for for-loops and for modifications of objects that could interact with loop counters or loop-control flags.\n\n- uint32, uint8\n  - The parameter types used by UtAssert_DoReport. Their underlying definitions (typedefs, signedness, width) are needed when reasoning about loop counters, increments, and whether modifications could overflow or alias other objects referenced in for-loop clauses.\n\nNote on scope: The target function itself contains no for-loop (it uses a while). Strictly speaking, if there is no for-loop in UtAssert_DoReport, MISRA rule about well-formed for-loops is not violated within this function. The above symbols are requested only to (a) ensure there are no hidden/inlined for-loops in called functions/macros used directly in UtAssert_DoReport, and (b) to permit a complete analysis if any for-loop were introduced by inlining or macro expansion of the listed calls."
