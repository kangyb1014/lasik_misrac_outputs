  "explanation": "- write: This function is not part of ISO C (it is a POSIX/syscall API). To decide if its use counts as a \"language extension\" per the compiler's documentation, the analyzer must check the declaration/availability of write in the target build environment (and whether the compiler documents it as an extension).\n- ssize_t: This signed size type is a POSIX type (not defined by ISO C). Determining whether its use violates the MISRA language-extension rule requires knowing where ssize_t is provided (header and/or compiler/library extension) and whether the compiler documents it as an extension.\n- STDOUT_FILENO: This macro (file descriptor for stdout) is defined by POSIX (typically in unistd.h). Its provenance must be checked against compiler/platform docs to see if it is an extension to ISO C.\n- unistd.h: This header is the typical place write and STDOUT_FILENO are declared/defined on POSIX systems. Presence of an include from this header indicates reliance on POSIX rather than ISO C; the analyzer should inspect this header in the target toolchain to identify extensions.\n- sys/types.h: ssize_t is commonly declared via sys/types.h (or similar). The analyzer needs the header origin to determine whether ssize_t is provided by the implementation as an extension.\n- size_t: Although size_t is part of standard C, including it here lets the analyzer verify that standard types are used where appropriate and distinguish them from implementation-specific types (ssize_t). It helps confirm which identifiers are standard vs. implementation-provided.\n\nCollectively these symbols let the next agent determine whether the identifiers used by OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl are standard C or implementation (POSIX/compiler) extensions according to the compiler/library documentation, which is required to assess compliance with the MISRA rule on language extensions."
