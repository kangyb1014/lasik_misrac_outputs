  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided function. The code uses only standard C types and control flow (void return, const char *, size_t) and calls to OS/library APIs (write, STDOUT_FILENO, ssize_t) which are POSIX/OS-level interfaces rather than compiler language extensions. There are no compiler-specific tokens or constructs present (for example no __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, asm, or other documented compiler extensions). Therefore there are no fragments that meet the criterion \u201cexplicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentation\u201d to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
