  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for analyzing MISRA rule (memcmp on null-terminated strings):\n\n- write: The target function calls write directly. Confirming write's semantic (unbuffered byte write) shows the target does not itself perform any string comparisons. Also rules out any macro indirection that might hide a memcmp call.\n\n- STDOUT_FILENO: The file-descriptor constant used in the write call; included to ensure there are no macros or wrappers that change behavior and possibly introduce string-comparison logic.\n\n- ssize_t: The signed return type of write used as WriteLen. Inspecting its typedef ensures no macro or inline function replaces the write call with code that might call memcmp.\n\n- size_t: The type of DataLen; included to make sure there are no hidden wrappers or conversions (macros) that could perform comparisons on null-terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function prohibited by the MISRA rule. Must be checked (in the target and in any directly related code) to ensure it is not used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- bcmp: An alternative memory-compare routine that might be used in place of memcmp; include it to detect equivalent violations.\n\n- OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl: A direct caller of the target (from the static call graph). Include its implementation so the reviewer can ensure that no memcmp usage affecting the target's behavior is propagated through callers or via inline/wrapper code.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: Another caller of the target. Inspecting this caller is required to make sure there are no macros/wrapper functions or inlined code that could cause memcmp to be executed in the same logical operation that handles null-terminated strings passed to the target.\n\n- UT_BSP_EndTest: Another caller; included for the same reason as above \u2014 to check whether any caller/inline path uses memcmp on null-terminated strings in conjunction with the target.\n\n- <string.h>: Header declaring memcmp and related string functions; include to resolve declarations/overrides and to detect any local redefinitions or macros that map memcmp to something else.\n\n- <unistd.h>: Header declaring write and STDOUT_FILENO on POSIX systems; included to verify the actual write prototype and constants, and to detect any platform-specific macros/wrappers.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The target function itself performs raw writes and does not call memcmp; the symbols above are the minimal set needed to (1) confirm the target makes no hidden calls to memcmp (via wrappers/macros/typedefs), and (2) inspect direct callers for any tightly-coupled code paths or inlined/wrapper implementations that could constitute a rule violation in the overall call context."
