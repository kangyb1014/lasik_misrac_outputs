The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- write: This function is invoked inside the loop body. MISRA's for\u2011loop rule treats the behaviour of any function called inside a loop as part of the loop body, so the analyzer must know whether write has any side effects that could modify a loop counter or other objects used for loop control (or otherwise affect loop semantics). The prototype/semantics (e.g. return conventions, signal/errno effects) are needed to conclude it is safe.\n\n- STDOUT_FILENO: The macro/value passed to write. Knowing whether this is a simple integer constant (no side effects) helps determine that the call does not use/modify objects that could serve as loop counters or loop control flags.\n\n- ssize_t: The signed integer type of WriteLen. The analyzer needs the exact signedness/width to reason about the comparison WriteLen <= 0, the arithmetic WriteLen used to advance Str and reduce DataLen, and whether any implicit conversions could affect loop\u2011control behaviour.\n\n- size_t: The unsigned type of DataLen. Its exact type/sign semantics are required to reason about the condition DataLen > 0 and the subtraction DataLen -= WriteLen (mixing ssize_t and size_t), to determine whether loop\u2011control objects could be modified in ways relevant to MISRA for\u2011loop constraints.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any called function or used object could act as or modify a for\u2011loop counter or loop control flag (per MISRA rule). No other external symbols are referenced by the target function."
