  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. The function and its local declarations use only standard C constructs: a typedef-based integer type (int32 from int32_t), macro-defined compile-time array size (local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN]), standard function calls and returns, and plain preprocessor macros. There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__/__inline__ assembly, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, Microsoft/GCC-specific keywords, pragmas that imply extensions, zero-length arrays, or other vendor-specific constructs. The macros shown are simple arithmetic macro expressions (OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN defined as a sum) which produce a compile-time constant suitable for an array bound. Given the provided definitions (int32 from int32_t and OS_SUCCESS as 0), nothing in this fragment requires further investigation for Rule 1.2."
