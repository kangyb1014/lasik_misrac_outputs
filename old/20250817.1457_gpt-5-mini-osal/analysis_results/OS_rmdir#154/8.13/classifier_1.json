  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: local_path is an array object (char local_path[OS_MAX_LOCAL_PATH_LEN]) not a pointer declaration, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (which concerns pointer const-qualification) does not apply. The array is intended as a mutable buffer to receive the translated path; making it const would prevent needed modification."
