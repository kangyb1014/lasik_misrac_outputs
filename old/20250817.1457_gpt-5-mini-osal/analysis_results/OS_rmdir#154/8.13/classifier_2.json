  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Based on the fragment alone there is no evidence of a Rule 8.13 violation. Passing the local_path array to OS_DirRemove_Impl is compliant if the implementation prototype is declared to take a pointer to const (e.g. int32 OS_DirRemove_Impl(const char *path)); this satisfies the requirement that pointers point to const-qualified types where possible. A violation would only occur if OS_DirRemove_Impl were declared to take a non-const pointer (char *) while it does not modify the data; in that specific case the function parameter should be changed to const char * and the call would then comply."
