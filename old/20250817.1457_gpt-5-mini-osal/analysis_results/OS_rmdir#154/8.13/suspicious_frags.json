  "explanation": "The remaining fragments do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified: the function parameter is already declared as const char *path (satisfies the rule), return_code is a non-pointer integer type, the control flow (if/return) contains no pointer declarations or pointer arguments needing const qualification, and there are no other pointer variables in the function. The listed fragments are the only places where a non-const character buffer or a non-const pointer usage occurs and thus should be investigated for possible use of const-qualified pointer types."
