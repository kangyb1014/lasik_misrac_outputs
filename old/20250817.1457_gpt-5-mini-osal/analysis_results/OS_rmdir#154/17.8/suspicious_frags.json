  "explanation": "No code fragment in this function modifies the parameter 'path' itself. The function only: (1) declares a local array local_path, (2) calls OS_TranslatePath(path, local_path) passing the pointer (no assignment to path), and (3) calls OS_DirRemove_Impl(local_path). There are no assignments, increments, reassignments, or other operations that alter the pointer parameter. The pointer is declared as 'const char *path', so the object it points to is intended to be immutable in this scope. Therefore there are no fragments here that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
