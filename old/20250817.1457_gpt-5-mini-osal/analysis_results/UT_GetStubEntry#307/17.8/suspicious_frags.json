  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code. The parameters FuncKey and TestMode are only read (used in the initial computation of Idx, in the conditional that sets SearchLimit/SearchKey, and in comparisons). No assignment to FuncKey or TestMode occurs. There are no pointer parameters to this function, so the rule\u2019s restriction on not modifying pointer parameters does not apply. Local variables (Idx, SearchKey, StubPtr, SearchLen, SearchLimit) are modified, which is permitted. Access to UT_StubTable through the local pointer StubPtr modifies the referenced objects but not any function parameter, so it does not violate Rule 17.8."
