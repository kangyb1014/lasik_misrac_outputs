  "explanation": "Fragments not included because they are not suspicious under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13:\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById(..., OS_object_token_t *token): This function initializes/fills the token (calls OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit and writes token->obj_idx and token->obj_id). The token pointer is an output/initializer and therefore must be non-const.\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit(..., OS_object_token_t *token): Initialization routine (called before use) must be able to modify the token, so non-const is appropriate.\n- OS_ObjectIdToArrayIndex(idtype, id, &token->obj_idx): This is called with the address of a token field to receive the array index; it is an output parameter and must be non-const.\n- OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(token): This cleans up/reset state for the token on error and therefore legitimately modifies it.\n- sem_wait(&impl->id): sem_wait takes a pointer to an OS/implementation semaphore object and modifies internal state; the pointer cannot be const.\n- OS_CountSemTake_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token) and static inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token): These already use const-qualified pointer parameters and thus conform to Rule 8.13.\n\nThe selected suspicious fragments are places where a function currently accepts or is invoked with a non-const OS_object_token_t * (or where a non-const parameter is declared) but, based on the shown code paths, appear to only read the token contents and therefore should be investigated to determine whether the parameter could be const-qualified to improve const-correctness and satisfy MISRA Rule 8.13."
