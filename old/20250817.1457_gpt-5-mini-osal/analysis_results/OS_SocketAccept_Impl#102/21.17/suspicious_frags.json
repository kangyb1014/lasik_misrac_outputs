  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in this function. Therefore there are no code fragments here that could violate Rule 21.17 and none need to be investigated for that specific rule. Note: the use of accept() with Addr->ActualLength affects buffer length, but it does not invoke any <string.h> functions and so is outside the scope of Rule 21.17 (it may be relevant to other safety checks, but should not be flagged for this rule)."
