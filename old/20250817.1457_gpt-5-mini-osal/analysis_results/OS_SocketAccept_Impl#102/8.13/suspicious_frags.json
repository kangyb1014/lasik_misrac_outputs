  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - conn_impl (OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *conn_impl and its assignment) is written to (conn_impl->fd = ...), so it must be a pointer to a non-const object. - Addr (OS_SockAddr_t *Addr) is both read and written (Addr->ActualLength is read and later updated, and Addr->AddrData is written by accept), so it cannot be const-qualified. - The &addrlen argument to accept must be a non-const pointer because accept writes the address length. - The &operation argument to OS_SelectSingle_Impl is likely used to return/status and therefore may be modified; it should remain non-const unless the callee is confirmed not to modify it. - sock_token and conn_token are already declared as pointers to const (const OS_object_token_t *), satisfying the rule. - Other scalar variables (return_code, operation, addrlen) are not pointer types and are out of scope for Rule 8.13."
