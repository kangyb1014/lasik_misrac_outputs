  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The claim is not demonstrably correct. MISRA 8.13 recommends using a pointer to const when the pointee is not modified through that pointer, but whether the pointer here can be const depends on context that is not provided: specifically the type returned by OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the prototype of iter->match. If iter->match expects a non-const OS_common_record_t * (or other code that receives this pointer expects to modify the record), changing the local declaration to const OS_common_record_t * would be incompatible. From the snippet alone we only see read-only accesses (record->active_id) and passing record to iter->match, but we cannot assume the callback does not modify the record. Therefore there is insufficient evidence to conclude a MISRA 8.13 violation. The test harness/logging added by agent A does not change the type/API constraints and the empty log output does not prove the pointer could safely be const."
