  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that use compiler-specific language extensions (such as GCC/Clang statement expressions ({ ... }), __attribute__ / __asm__ / typeof / __extension__, Microsoft __declspec, or other vendor-specific keywords) as explicitly documented as extensions. Specific notes:\n\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED uses a compound literal ((osal_id_t){0}). Compound literals are part of standard C (since C99), not a vendor extension.\n- The use of bool and false/true corresponds to standard C99 _Bool / stdbool.h usage, not a compiler extension.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the use of the address-of operator (&) and array indexing are all standard C constructs.\n- Control flow (do/while, if, break), pointer/struct usage, increment operator (++), and return of a bool are standard C language features.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in the provided code that should be flagged for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions). If you expect a specific compiler where a construct here is documented as an extension, provide that compiler documentation and I will re-evaluate against those vendor-specific extension lists."
