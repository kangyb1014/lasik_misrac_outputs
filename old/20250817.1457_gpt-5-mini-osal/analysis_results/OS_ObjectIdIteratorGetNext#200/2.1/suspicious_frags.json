  "explanation": "The listed fragments cover all control-flow elements that could produce unreachable code and therefore require inspection: the initialization of the token to undefined, the pre-check increment of the index, the limit check and break, the table access via the macro, the optional call through the match function pointer (including the short-circuit condition), the loop continuation condition, and the return. These are the only locations in the function where control flow decisions are made; other lines in the function are simple declarations/initializations (e.g. local variable declarations and got_next = false) or trivial single-expression statements whose reachability is determined by the listed control-flow fragments. The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx and the macro expands to an indexed access; their definitions do not themselves introduce additional branches or unreachable code beyond what is covered above. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 2.1."
