  "explanation": "I selected the above statements as candidates for investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 because they are executed assignments/operations whose removal could \u2014 in some configurations or usages \u2014 be redundant or have no observable effect; they therefore merit review to ensure none are truly dead code. Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for dead-code concerns: the function signature and local variable declarations are required for correct compilation and semantics; the do/while(!got_next) loop structure and the use of the got_next flag are the loop control mechanisms (removing them would clearly change behavior rather than be dead); the increment of obj_idx together with the index check and the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET are the mechanism to step through the table and fetch records (their purpose is evident and removal would alter behavior); and the return of the boolean result is the observable outcome of the function. In short, only the specific executed assignments/operations listed above deserve further inspection to determine whether, in the broader project context, any of them are actually dead (i.e., could be removed without changing program behavior)."
