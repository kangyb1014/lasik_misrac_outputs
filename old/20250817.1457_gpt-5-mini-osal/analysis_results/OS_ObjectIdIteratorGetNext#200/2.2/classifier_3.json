  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext:\n```c\nbool OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(OS_object_iter_t *iter)\n{\n    OS_common_record_t *record;\n    bool                got_next;\n\n    got_next           = false;\n    iter->token.obj_id = OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED;\n\n    do\n    {\n        ++iter->token.obj_idx;\n        if (iter->token.obj_idx >= iter->limit)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n\n        record = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(iter->base, iter->token);\n        if (iter->match == NULL || iter->match(iter->arg, &iter->token, record))\n        {\n            iter->token.obj_id = record->active_id;\n            got_next           = true;\n        }\n    } while (!got_next);\n\n    return got_next;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext:\ntypedef struct\n{\n    OS_common_record_t * base;\n    OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t match;\n    void *               arg;\n    osal_index_t         limit;\n    OS_object_token_t    token;\n} OS_object_iter_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_common_record OS_common_record_t\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\n#define OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED ((osal_id_t){0})\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (iter->token.obj_idx >= iter->limit)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The if-check and break are needed to stop the loop when obj_idx reaches the limit and to prevent an out-of-bounds access by OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET that uses obj_idx as an index. Removing the check would change program behaviour (and likely cause undefined behaviour), so the operation is not dead. (Only if there were a proven invariant that iter->token.obj_idx < iter->limit is always true would the test be dead; no such invariant is visible here.)"
