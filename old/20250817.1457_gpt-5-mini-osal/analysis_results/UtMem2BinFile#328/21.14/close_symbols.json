  "explanation": "To determine whether UtMem2BinFile violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings we must inspect the function itself and any called code that might perform such a comparison. The listed symbols are required as follows:\n\n- fopen: Standard I/O call used by UtMem2BinFile; include to confirm it is not a project wrapper that internally uses memcmp on strings.\n- fwrite: I/O call used by UtMem2BinFile; include to rule out any unexpected string comparisons inside a project-provided implementation.\n- fclose: As above for fwrite/fopen\u2014needed if libc is replaced by project code that might misuse memcmp.\n- printf: Called in the error path; include to ensure any project-provided printf variant does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings when formatting or handling specifiers.\n- strerror: Used to format the error message; include to check whether a project-specific strerror implementation (not the standard libc) uses memcmp incorrectly.\n- errno: The error indicator accessed by strerror/printf; include so the analyzer can follow error-reporting paths and implementations that might call memcmp.\n- UtAssert_True: Called from the error path; this test framework/assertion helper is the most likely place to perform comparisons (e.g., comparing expected vs actual strings). Its implementation must be inspected for any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Appears in the static call graph for the target and is part of the assertion framework; include to examine assertion internals and any string-comparison helpers it may call.\n- memcmp: The symbol to search for across the target and all reachable callees. To prove compliance you must show memcmp is not used to compare null-terminated strings in UtMem2BinFile or any function it (transitively) invokes.\n\nInspecting these symbols (and the implementations they reference) lets the next analyzer determine whether any reachable code path uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, which would violate the cited MISRA rule."
