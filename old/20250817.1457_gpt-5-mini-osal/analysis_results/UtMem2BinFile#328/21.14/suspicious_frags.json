  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code and supporting definitions and found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp or any code that compares null\u2011terminated strings using memcmp. The function UtMem2BinFile calls fopen, fwrite, fclose, printf and strerror(errno) only; the UtAssert_True macro and UtAssert_GetContext do not contain memcmp either. There are also no occurrences of patterns that would indicate memcmp-based string comparisons (for example memcmp(s1,s2,n) or memcmp(s1,s2,strlen(s1)+1)). Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
