First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to for statements and their three clauses. The provided target function UtMem2BinFile and the supplied additional code contain no for, while, or do-while loops and no macro expansions shown that introduce loops. The only control structure present is an if-else; all other items are function calls (fopen, fwrite, fclose, printf, strerror, UtAssert_True/UtAssertEx) and a macro expansion shown that maps to a function call. Therefore there are no for-loop fragments to be investigated for Rule 14.2 in the supplied code. If there are other macro definitions or omitted code (the ellipsis in the macro area) that might expand to for loops, those should be provided for review; based on the code shown, nothing else needs investigation under Rule 14.2."
