  "explanation": "strerror: This function is declared in <string.h> on many platforms and returns a pointer to a C string. To judge MISRA string-bound safety we need its exact contract (signature and guarantee that the returned buffer is NUL-terminated and the caller only reads up to that terminator). errno: The value passed to strerror influences which message is returned; include it to ensure strerror is being called with a valid errno and to understand any platform-specific behavior relevant to the returned string. printf: The call uses \"%s\" which reads a NUL-terminated C string. Its semantics (reads up to the terminating NUL) are essential to decide if passing Filename or strerror(errno) might result in out-of-bounds reads. fopen: Takes a C string path and reads it until the terminating NUL; if Filename is not NUL-terminated or not a valid string pointer, fopen would perform out-of-bounds reads. UtAssert_True: Called in the error path; its implementation may itself call string.h functions (e.g., strlen/strcpy/strcat) when formatting or storing messages \u2014 we must inspect it to see whether passing the literal message or Filename/strerror result could cause out-of-bounds accesses. UtAssert_GetContext: The static call graph shows UtAssert_True uses UtAssert_GetContext; include it because UtAssert_True\u2019s behavior may depend on it and that code might use string functions. Filename (caller-supplied char *): The function passes Filename to fopen and to printf \"%s\"; to determine compliance we must know the calling contract (is it guaranteed to be a NUL-terminated, valid pointer?) \u2014 otherwise these calls could read out-of-bounds. Memory (const void *) and Length (uint32): While not string objects, include them to be explicit about the buffer contracts (to ensure no string function is used on Memory) and to confirm that no implicit conversions or subsequent code would treat Memory as a C-string (which could cause string.h functions to read past bounds)."
