  "scenario": "Not violated. The call fopen(Filename, \"w\") is not a <string.h> string-handling function covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, so this fragment does not by itself violate Rule 21.17. (Note: if Filename did not point to a valid null-terminated string or were out-of-bounds, functions that read it \u2014 fopen, printf, etc. \u2014 could read beyond the object bounds, which is a safety/error condition but not a violation of Rule 21.17 specifically. A concrete Rule\u00a021.17 violation example would be calling a <string.h> function such as strcpy(dest, Filename) when Filename is not null-terminated or its buffer bounds are exceeded.)"
