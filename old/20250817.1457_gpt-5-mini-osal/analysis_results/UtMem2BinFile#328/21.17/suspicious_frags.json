  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not call string handling functions from <string.h> that take pointer parameters (the focus of Rule 21.17) or otherwise perform string/memory accesses that could index past object bounds. Specifically: the variable declaration (FILE *fp;), the fclose(fp); and the return statements simply manage resources/flow and do not perform buffer accesses; the UtAssert_True macro invocation and the provided UtAssert_GetContext definition are not string.h calls and only pass a string literal (no external pointer buffer access here); the macro definition snippets shown do not perform string operations on caller-provided buffers. The only places in the function that read from caller-provided buffers or produce string reads are those listed in suspicious_frags, and those should be investigated for potential out-of-bounds accesses."
