  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17: the code calls fwrite (stdio.h), not any of the string.h functions listed in Rule 21.17. Note: there remains a separate possible runtime safety concern if the object pointed to by Memory is smaller than Length (this would be a buffer over-read), but that is not covered by Rule 21.17."
