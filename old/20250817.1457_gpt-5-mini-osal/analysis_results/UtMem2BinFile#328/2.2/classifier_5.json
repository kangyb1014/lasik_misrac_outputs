  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtMem2BinFile:\n```c\nbool UtMem2BinFile(const void *Memory, const char *Filename, uint32 Length)\n{\n    FILE *fp;\n\n    if ((fp = fopen(Filename, \"w\")))\n    {\n        fwrite(Memory, Length, 1, fp);\n        fclose(fp);\n        return true;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"UtMem2BinFile: Error Opening File: %s, %s\\n\", Filename, strerror(errno));\n        UtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFile: Error Opening File\");\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtMem2BinFile:\n#define UtAssert_True(Expression, __VA_ARGS__) UtAssertEx(Expression,UtAssert_GetContext(),__FILE__,__LINE__,__VA_ARGS__)\n...\nUtAssert_CaseType_t UtAssert_GetContext(void)\n{\n    return DefaultContext;\n}\n...\ntypedef uint32_t  uint32\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nUtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFile: Error Opening File\");\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated: The call to UtAssert_True(false, \"UtMem2BinFile: Error Opening File\"); is executed only on the fopen() error path and expands to UtAssertEx(...). That assertion call produces observable side-effects (logging/test reporting and possibly aborting) so its removal would change program behaviour. Therefore it is not dead code. (Only if UtAssert_True were defined as a no-op in the build would it become dead; given the provided macro mapping to UtAssertEx, it is active.)"
