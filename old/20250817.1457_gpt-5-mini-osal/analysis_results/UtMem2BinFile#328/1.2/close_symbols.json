  "explanation": "- UtAssert_True: The call in the target expands to this (or a related) macro/function. Its definition must be inspected because test/assert macros frequently use compiler extensions (e.g., GCC statement-expressions, __attribute__, builtins). To decide if an extension is used you must see the macro/function body.\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Appears in the static call graph and is likely referenced/expanded by the UtAssert_True macro. Its implementation/definition could contain extensions and must be checked.\n- fopen, fwrite, fclose, printf, strerror: Standard library functions used by the function. While usually standard, some platforms provide nonstandard implementations or wrappers (or macros) that may use compiler extensions; their declarations/definitions (or macros) should be checked to ensure no extension usage is hidden.\n- errno: Usually a macro that may expand to a thread-local accessor (e.g., __errno_location, __thread) or other compiler-specific facility. You must inspect its definition to ensure it does not rely on compiler extensions.\n- FILE: The FILE type is used as a parameter/variable type; some implementations may typedef it to an implementation-specific type or use extensions. Confirming its definition is needed to rule out extensions.\n- size_t: Used by fwrite prototype; inspect its typedef to ensure no nonstandard extension is involved.\n- uint32: The typedef used for Length may be a project-defined alias (not a standard type). Its definition must be checked to determine whether it uses compiler-specific attributes or extensions (e.g., unusual typedefs, bitfields, or compiler-specific width attributes).\n- bool: Although C99/_Bool or stdbool.h is standard, some projects define a custom bool macro/typedef that could use extensions; inspect its definition to ensure no compiler extensions are used.\n\nThese symbols cover macros, typedefs and functions whose definitions could hide compiler language extensions; they must be available so the next analyzer can determine definitively whether any language extensions are used in or by UtMem2BinFile."
