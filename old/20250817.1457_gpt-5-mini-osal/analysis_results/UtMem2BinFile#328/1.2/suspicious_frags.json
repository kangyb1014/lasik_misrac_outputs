  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided fragments. Reasoning for not flagging specific parts:\n- File I/O and diagnostics (FILE, fopen, fwrite, fclose, printf, errno, strerror) are standard C library usage, not compiler extensions.\n- The boolean type (bool) and the use of uint32 (typedef of uint32_t) are standard language/library typedefs (stdbool.h/stdint.h) or user typedefs, not compiler-specific extensions.\n- The macro usage shown (UtAssert_True with __VA_ARGS__) uses standard C preprocessor variadic macros and the standard predefined macros __FILE__ and __LINE__; these are part of C99/C11, not compiler extensions.\n- Function declaration and return usage (UtMem2BinFile, UtAssert_GetContext) use standard C syntax.\n- No occurrences of known compiler-specific extension constructs are present (for example: __attribute__, asm/inline assembly, typeof, statement expressions, unnamed/anonymous nonstandard constructs, pragmas that are compiler-specific, or identifiers beginning with implementation-reserved double underscores except the standard __FILE__/__LINE__/__VA_ARGS__).\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used). If additional files or build-specific macros/pragmas are present elsewhere (build flags, compiler-specific headers, or other source files), those should be checked separately because they can introduce extensions not visible in the snippets provided."
