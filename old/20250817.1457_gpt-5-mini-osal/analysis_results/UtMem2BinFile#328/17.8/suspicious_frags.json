  "explanation": "None of the function parameters are modified in the shown code. Specifically:\n- Memory is declared as const void * and is only passed as an argument to fwrite (used as a read-only source); there is no assignment to Memory and no call that modifies the pointer variable itself.\n- Filename is declared as const char * and is only passed to fopen and printf; these calls receive the pointer by value and do not modify the Filename parameter variable.\n- Length is passed by value and is not assigned to or altered.\n- There are no statements like Memory = ..., Filename = ..., or Length = ... in the function body.\n- The UtAssert_True macro expansion and UtAssert_GetContext call do not modify any of the function's parameters.\nBecause the pointer parameters are not reassigned and no parameter is modified, there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
