  "explanation": "- fopen: The branch condition (if ((fp = fopen(...)))) depends on fopen's run\u2011time behavior and return values. To decide whether the else branch can be reached (unreachable code) you must know fopen's possible outcomes in the analysis environment.\n- fwrite: Part of the then branch. If fopen cannot succeed, fwrite would be unreachable; include it to check whether any side effects or non\u2011returning behaviour inside it affect reachability.\n- fclose: Same as fwrite \u2014 used in the then branch and relevant when assessing reachability of that branch.\n- printf: Called in the else branch before UtAssert_True. If UtAssert_True does not return, printf may still execute or be unreachable depending on control flow; include to reason about statements in that else block.\n- strerror: Used to form the printf argument in the else branch. Needed to determine whether that call can be reordered/optimized away or has side effects affecting reachability.\n- errno: External variable read by strerror; include because its value affects the argument to printf and may be relevant to static analysis of side effects.\n- UtAssert_True: Critical. The else branch calls UtAssert_True(false,...). If UtAssert_True is defined as a non\u2011returning function (e.g., it calls exit/abort/longjmp), then the subsequent 'return false;' would be unreachable. You must inspect UtAssert_True's implementation and callees to decide reachability.\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Present in the static call graph and likely used by the UtAssert family. Include to follow the assertion implementation chain and check for non\u2011returning behavior.\n- exit / abort / longjmp: Representative non\u2011returning library functions that UtAssert_True (or functions it calls) might invoke. Include them so the analyzer can detect any non\u2011returning calls in the UtAssert_True call chain that would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether either the then or else blocks (or the final 'return false;') can be proven unreachable due to the behavior of fopen or the assertion routine (non\u2011returning calls)."
