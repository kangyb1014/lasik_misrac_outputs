  "explanation": "The remainder of the function contains no other likely unreachable code. The fopen-success branch (fwrite, fclose, return true) is a straightforward, reachable path. The if condition uses assignment to capture fopen's result which does not by itself create unreachable code. No other statements in the function form dead code constructs that require investigation."
