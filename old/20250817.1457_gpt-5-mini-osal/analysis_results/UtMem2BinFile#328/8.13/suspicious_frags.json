  "explanation": "I found no code fragments in the provided code that warrant investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13. Reasoning: \n- Function parameters that are pointers are already const-qualified where appropriate: Memory is declared const void * and Filename is declared const char *.\n- The local FILE *fp must be a non-const pointer because the standard I/O API (fopen/fwrite/fclose) requires a modifiable FILE *; making it a pointer-to-const would be incompatible with those APIs.\n- The call to strerror(errno) uses a library function that returns a char *; this is a library API detail and there is no local pointer that could be made const instead.\n- There are no other pointer declarations or pointer-to-data usages in the snippet (the UtAssert macros and UtAssert_GetContext do not introduce pointer-to-data parameters here).\nGiven the above, there are no places in the supplied code where a pointer should be changed to point to a const-qualified type and thus no suspicious fragments to report."
