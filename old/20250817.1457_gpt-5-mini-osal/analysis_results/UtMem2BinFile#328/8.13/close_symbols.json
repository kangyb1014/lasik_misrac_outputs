  "explanation": "To determine if UtMem2BinFile respects the MISRA rule (pointers should be const-qualified when possible) we must know the exact types/prototypes of the library and project symbols it uses and the typedefs for its parameter types:\n\n- FILE: needed to know the type of the FILE* stream parameter to fopen/fwrite/fclose and ensure no implicit cast affects constness.\n- fopen: its prototype (e.g. FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode)) is required to verify the const qualification of the Filename parameter expected by fopen.\n- fwrite: prototype (size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)) is required to confirm whether fwrite accepts a const void * (so passing const void *Memory is appropriate) or a non-const pointer (which could indicate a const-qualification mismatch).\n- fclose: prototype (int fclose(FILE *stream)) to ensure correct stream type usage; included for completeness of I/O APIs used.\n- printf: prototype to confirm how the string arguments are accepted (const char * vs char *) and ensure no constness issues when passing string literals or strerror results.\n- strerror: prototype (char *strerror(int)) is required to know whether it returns a non-const char * or const char *; that affects whether passing its result to functions or storing it would violate const rules.\n- errno: declaration/type (macro/int) to resolve the use of strerror(errno) and ensure no hidden constness concerns from errno usage.\n- UtAssert_True: prototype (or macro definition) because the function is called with a string literal; we must know whether its parameters are declared const-qualified (e.g. const char *) or not\u2014if not, that could indicate a broader constness violation in project APIs.\n- UtAssert_GetContext: included because it appears in the static call graph as a callee related to the assert mechanism; its signatures may influence how UtAssert_True/related APIs handle pointer constness internally.\n- size_t: used by fwrite/fopen prototypes and to interpret Length/size parameters; needed to check type compatibility and const-correctness in I/O calls.\n- bool: the return type of UtMem2BinFile; required to resolve whether headers/types used change pointer qualifications (e.g. custom bool typedefs that might affect prototypes).\n- uint32: the typedef of Length; needed to confirm its definition and whether any implicit casts to size_t occur when calling fwrite (which could affect parameter types and lead to casts that change constness).\n\nHaving these prototypes and typedefs lets the analyzer verify that all pointer arguments passed by UtMem2BinFile are const-qualified where the callee accepts const pointers (or identify places where a callee requires non-const, which would be a potential MISRA concern)."
