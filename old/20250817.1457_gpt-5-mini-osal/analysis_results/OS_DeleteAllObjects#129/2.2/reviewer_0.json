  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_DeleteAllObjects code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_DeleteAllObjects.\n```c\nvoid OS_DeleteAllObjects(void)\n{\n    uint32 ObjectCount;\n    uint32 TryCount;\n\n    /*\n     * Note - this is done in a loop because some objects depend on other objects\n     * and you will not be able to delete the object until the ref count becomes zero.\n     */\n    TryCount = 0;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        ObjectCount = 0;\n        ++TryCount;\n\n        /* Delete timers and tasks first, as they could be actively using other object types  */\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        /* Then try to delete all other remaining objects of any type */\n        OS_ForEachObject(OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        if (ObjectCount == 0 || TryCount > 4)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n        OS_TaskDelay(5);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:In OS_CleanUpObject the switch's default branch contains only \"break;\". If OS_IdentifyObject returns a value not matched by any case, execution will take the default branch and simply exit the switch; removing the default: break; statement would not change program behaviour. Therefore the executed operation (the break in the default branch) is redundant and constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (To comply, either remove the empty default or make it meaningful \u2014 e.g. log/error/ASSERT \u2014 so its presence affects behaviour.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_LogProbe(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1034.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f ==
