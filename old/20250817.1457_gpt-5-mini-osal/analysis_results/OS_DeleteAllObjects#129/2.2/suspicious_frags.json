  "explanation": "I inspected all provided functions and found only the empty default case in the switch inside OS_CleanUpObject as an executed operation that appears to have no effect if removed. Other fragments were not reported because: \n\n- OS_DeleteAllObjects loop variables and structure (ObjectCount, TryCount, the loop, the OS_TaskDelay call, and the ordered calls to OS_ForEachObjectOfType/OS_ForEachObject) have observable effects on control flow, timeout/scheduling behavior, and the iteration/deletion order. Removing any of these operations would change the program behavior or timing (note that timing/ordering can be semantically significant in embedded systems). \n\n- The OS_ForEachObjectOfType and OS_ForEachObject functions set up iterators and invoke callbacks; their assignments and calls are required to produce the side effects (object processing/deletion). The iterator init/destroy and the loop over iterator entries are necessary for correct operation. \n\n- OS_CleanUpObject increments the provided ObjectCount and executes deletion calls in each switch case; all these operations produce side effects (counts and resource deletions). Removing them would change the behavior. \n\n- The lock/unlock sequence in OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry is required to safely call the callback with the global lock temporarily released. \n\n- The wrapper OS_TaskDelay simply forwards to the implementation; although trivial, the call is necessary for the API and to effect a delay. \n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit assigns iterator fields prior to attempting the transaction init; these assignments prepare the iterator for use if init succeeds. \n\n- OS_API_Teardown and OS_ApplicationShutdown perform ordered teardown and global-state changes; their calls and assignments have side effects. \n\nTherefore, aside from the empty default case listed above, no other code fragment in the provided snippets is a clear instance of dead code (i.e., an executed operation whose removal would have no effect)."
