  "scenario": "No \u2014 based on this call the pointer is passed so the callback can update the ObjectCount (i.e. the pointed-to value is intended to be modified), so a non-const pointer is appropriate. A violation would occur if the API/prototypes (OS_ForEachObjectOfType or OS_CleanUpObject) do not actually modify the pointed-to object but declare the parameter as a pointer to non-const; in that case the parameter should be a pointer to const (e.g. const uint32 * or const void *) to comply with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
