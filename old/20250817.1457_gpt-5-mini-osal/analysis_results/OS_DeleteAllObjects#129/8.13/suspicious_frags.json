  "explanation": "No other pointer usages appear in this function body that would be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The local variable declarations (uint32 ObjectCount; uint32 TryCount;) are plain scalars, loop/control statements (while, if, break) and the integer literal argument to OS_TaskDelay(5) do not involve pointers. Function names and enum/constant arguments (e.g. OS_OBJECT_TYPE_*, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject) are not pointer-to-object instances in this fragment. Therefore, aside from the code fragments listed above, there are no additional pointer-to-object occurrences in this function that need investigation for const-qualification under Rule 8.13."
