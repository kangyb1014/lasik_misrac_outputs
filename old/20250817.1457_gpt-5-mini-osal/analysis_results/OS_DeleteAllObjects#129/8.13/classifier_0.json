  "scenario": "No. In this fragment ObjectCount is initialized to 0 immediately before the call and is intended to be updated by the called routine(s) (e.g. OS_CleanUpObject via OS_ForEachObjectOfType). That requires a writable (non-const) pointer, so using &ObjectCount is appropriate and does not violate Rule 8.13. (If, instead, the called function only read the value and never modified it, then passing a pointer to a non-const object would be a potential violation \u2014 the parameter should be a pointer to const in that case.)"
