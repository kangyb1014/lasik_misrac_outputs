In OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry the code unlocks the global lock, calls func(...), then re-locks. In the provided callbacks (OS_CleanUpObject) one case calls OS_TaskDelete(object_id). If this deletes the currently executing task (or otherwise does not return, e.g. calls a non-returning API, exit, longjmp to another context, etc.), the subsequent OS_Lock_Global(&iter->token) will never be executed on that execution path. This makes that statement effectively unreachable in that scenario, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C Rule 2.1 forbids code that is unreachable (i.e. cannot be executed in any program execution). Agent A\u2019s argument confuses a runtime termination of one execution path (a callback that does not return) with static unreachable code. A callback that sometimes does not return does not make the subsequent statements statically unreachable for the project as a whole. The provided exhaustive test logs show OS_DeleteAllObjects entering and exiting normally (the loop iterations, break and function exit are executed), demonstrating the code is reachable in normal executions. Therefore this does not constitute a Rule 2.1 violation."
