  "explanation": "Fragments NOT listed were examined and are not obvious candidates for unreachable code under the shown context. Specifically:\n- Individual case labels in the OS_CleanUpObject switch (other than the TASK deletion case above) are normal callbacks that return to the caller and thus are not prima facie unreachable.\n- The OS_ForEachObjectOfType initialization and the while-loop header (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext) were included only as part of the larger iterator block above; their bodies are reachable when the iterator init succeeds and therefore do not, by themselves, indicate unreachable code.\n- Simple forwarding functions (e.g., OS_TaskDelay returning OS_TaskDelay_Impl) contain a single return and no trailing statements that would be unreachable.\n- Macro definitions and constant definitions are declarations/constants and not executable code that can be unreachable.\n- The default: break; in the switch is a valid, reachable fallback if the identifier is outside the enumerated cases; without the full enumeration definitions it is not safe to assume it is unreachable.\n\nThe selected fragments were chosen because they present plausible situations where code following a callback or operation could never be reached (for example: callbacks that may not return, iterator cleanup that may be skipped if a callback causes task termination, or loops whose iteration bounds are driven by macros that could be zero). These should be investigated further to determine whether any statements are truly unreachable in the actual build/configuration."
