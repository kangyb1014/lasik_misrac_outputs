For example, if UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType was called with TypeName == NULL (or with a pointer to a non\u2013NUL-terminated string) then StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr may be NULL or unterminated. Later, when UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr() is called with a matching ReturnSize, the expression strcmp(TypeName, StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr) will be evaluated and will dereference a NULL pointer or read past the end of the buffer, thereby accessing memory beyond the bounds of the object(s) and violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nvoid OS_DeleteAllObjects(void)\n{\n    uint32 ObjectCount;\n    uint32 TryCount;\n    FILE *logf = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1039.txt\", \"a\");\n\n    if (logf)\n    {\n        fprintf(logf, \"---- OS_DeleteAllObjects ENTRY ----\\n\");\n        fflush(logf);\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * Note - this is done in a loop because some objects depend on other objects\n     * and you will not be able to delete the object until the ref count becomes zero.\n     */\n    TryCount = 0;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        ObjectCount = 0;\n        ++TryCount;\n\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"Iteration start: TryCount=%lu, initial ObjectCount=%lu\\n\",\n                    (unsigned long)TryCount, (unsigned long)ObjectCount);\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n\n        /* Delete timers and tasks first, as they could be actively using other object types  */\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"Calling OS_ForEachObjectOfType: OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB\\n\");\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"After OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB: ObjectCount=%lu\\n\", (unsigned long)ObjectCount);\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"Calling OS_ForEachObjectOfType: OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE\\n\");\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"After OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE: ObjectCount=%lu\\n\", (unsigned long)ObjectCount);\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"Calling OS_ForEachObjectOfType: OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK\\n\");\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"After OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK: ObjectCount=%lu\\n\", (unsigned long)ObjectCount);\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n\n        /* Then try to delete all other remaining objects of any type */\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"Calling OS_ForEachObject: delete remaining objects\\n\");\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n        OS_ForEachObject(OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"After OS_ForEachObject: ObjectCount=%lu\\n\", (unsigned long)ObjectCount);\n            fflush(logf);\n        }\n\n        if (ObjectCount == 0 || TryCount > 4)\n        {\n            if (logf)\n            {\n                fprintf(logf, \"Breaking loop: ObjectCount=%lu, TryCount=%lu\\n\",\n                        (unsigned long)ObjectCount, (unsigned long)TryCount);\n                fprintf(logf, \"---- OS_DeleteAllObjects EXIT ----\\n\\n\");\n                fflush(logf);\n                fclose(logf);\n            }\n            break;\n        }\n\n        if (logf)\n        {\n            fprintf(logf, \"Objects remain;

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The reported violation is not correct. The OS_DeleteAllObjects function as shown contains no calls to any <string.h> routines (memcpy, strcmp, etc.); it only loops and invokes OS_ForEachObjectOfType/OS_ForEachObject and OS_TaskDelay. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns the use of the standard string functions; any unsafe use of strcmp would be a defect in the function that implements OS_CleanUpObject or related utilities (e.g. UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr/UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType), not in OS_DeleteAllObjects itself. The provided test logs further show that no objects were processed (ObjectCount remained 0), so the alleged strcmp path was not exercised. Therefore the claim that OS_DeleteAllObjects violates Rule 21.17 is incorrect."
