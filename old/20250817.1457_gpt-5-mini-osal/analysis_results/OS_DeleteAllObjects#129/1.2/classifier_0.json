  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the fragment does not use any compiler-specific language extensions. Constructs like while(true) rely on the standard boolean macro (true) from <stdbool.h> or a project-defined macro, and the other identifiers (uint32 typedef and #define constants) are standard C or project headers, not compiler extensions."
