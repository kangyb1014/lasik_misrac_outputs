The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) OS_object_token_t: The full typedef/struct definition is required to confirm what kind of object is being copied by the statement '*token_to = *token_from'. We must ensure the assignment is a plain struct/scalar copy (no underlying macro or function-call semantics, no hidden function-like macros, and no unusual members that could embed or invoke code containing for-loops).  \n\n2) lock_mode (the type of the lock_mode member inside OS_object_token_t, e.g. OS_lock_mode_t): The definition of the lock_mode member's type is needed to verify that the write 'token_from->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE;' is a simple scalar assignment and does not expand to or invoke code (macros, inline functions) that could contain for-loops or side effects. It also helps check whether lock_mode is itself an aggregate or has special semantics.  \n\n3) OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: The macro/enum/value definition is required to ensure that substituting this symbol does not expand into an expression containing control flow (for/while) or function calls. A complex macro could hide a loop, which would be relevant to the MISRA for-loop well-formedness check.\n\nNo called functions appear in OS_ObjectIdTransferToken; therefore no other function bodies are needed for evaluating for-loop usage in this function. The three symbols above suffice to determine whether any hidden for-loops or loop-like behaviour are introduced by the types or macros used in the function."
