  "explanation": "No unreachable code is present in the provided function. The function contains only two executable statements (a structure copy and a field assignment) and no control-flow constructs (no return, goto, break, continue, or conditional branches) that could make any statement unreachable. Both statements are executed sequentially whenever the function is called, so there are no code paths that render any statement unreachable. Note: potential runtime issues such as null-pointer dereference, aliasing (token_from == token_to), or overlapping objects can cause undefined behaviour but do not create unreachable code per MISRA C Rule 2.1; those should be checked under the appropriate MISRA rules (e.g., pointer validity, aliasing rules), not Rule 2.1."
