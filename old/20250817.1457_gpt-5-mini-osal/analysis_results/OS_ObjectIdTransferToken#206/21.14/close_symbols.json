  "explanation": "OS_object_token_t (struct definition): The target function copies and modifies an OS_object_token_t. To determine whether any memcmp use would be comparing null-terminated strings you must know the token layout \u2014 in particular whether it contains char arrays or char * pointers that hold null-terminated strings. This is the primary symbol required.\n\nlock_mode member type / enum used by OS_object_token_t: The function assigns token_from->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE; the exact type/enum of lock_mode (and its valid values) is needed to ensure this write does not alias or overlap other token fields (e.g., a union) that might contain strings \u2014 which could affect whether later memcmp calls compare string data.\n\nOS_LOCK_MODE_NONE (macro/enum constant): Knowing the definition/value and semantic meaning of this constant clarifies what the function is doing to the token state and whether that change affects string storage/ownership semantics.\n\nmemcmp and any project wrapper around it: The MISRA rule specifically concerns use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. Even though OS_ObjectIdTransferToken does not call memcmp itself, the analysis must know the project\u2019s memcmp symbol(s) (standard memcmp or a wrapped variant) so the analyzer can detect any use of memcmp on fields of OS_object_token_t (either within this translation unit or in callers) that might be introduced or enabled by the token transfer.\n\nHeaders that declare OS_object_token_t and memcmp (the defining header for the token type and <string.h> or project wrapper header): The exact declarations (sizes of arrays, pointer types, prototypes) are required to determine whether fields are null-terminated strings and to find any in-scope memcmp usage.\n\nCallers that manipulate tokens with potential string comparisons: OS_DoTimerAdd, OS_TimerDelete: These callers appear in the static call graph and may use the token afterwards; to fully assess whether transferring the token can lead to memcmp being used to compare null-terminated strings (e.g., code that later compares token fields with memcmp), the analyzer should inspect these callers for memcmp usage on token fields. Including them as symbols lets the next agent locate potential memcmp uses that involve the token.\n\n(Provided symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether OS_ObjectIdTransferToken itself or its immediate interactions can lead to memcmp being used to compare null-terminated strings.)"
