  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule: Language extensions should not be used) we must inspect the types and macros it manipulates, because extensions are commonly introduced there rather than in the simple pointer and assignment syntax shown. Specifically:\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The full typedef/struct definition is required to check whether the type uses any compiler extensions (compiler-specific attributes, non-standard storage/class specifiers, packed/aligned pragmas, anonymous/unnamed members implemented as extensions, flexible array members used in a non-standard way, GCC extensions such as __extension__ or typeof in member declarations, etc.). Struct assignment itself is standard C, but the struct layout or annotations may rely on extensions.\n\n- lock_mode (member of OS_object_token_t): The code writes to token_from->lock_mode. We must know the declared type of this member (e.g., an enum, bitfield, or typedef) to verify that it does not use non-standard bitfield widths, implementation-specific bitfield types, anonymous bitfields implemented via extensions, or attribute-annotated members that are compiler-specific.\n\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: The constant/value assigned to lock_mode may be a macro or enum. Its definition must be inspected to ensure it is not implemented using compiler extensions (e.g., statement expressions ({ ... }), __extension__ constructs, or attributes on the constant) and that its type is standard C.\n\n- typedefs used inside OS_object_token_t (member types): Any nested typedefs (for example integer-width types like uint32_t if redefined, or OS-specific id types) used by the struct members could themselves be defined using extensions or macros that expand to compiler-specific constructs. Those typedef definitions must be checked.\n\n- attribute/packing macros used in OS_object_token_t declaration (e.g. PACKED, __attribute__, __aligned__, OSAL_* attribute macros): Declarations frequently include macros or attributes to control alignment/packing or to annotate fields/functions. Those macros/attributes can be compiler-specific extensions; their expansions must be examined.\n\n- header(s) that declare OS_object_token_t and OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: The headers will show any #pragma, #if defined(__GNUC__) branches, or other conditional uses of compiler extensions. Examining the header context is necessary to discover conditional extension usage.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions allows the next analyst to determine whether any non-standard language features or compiler-specific extensions are used in the types or macros the function relies on. The function body itself (pointer dereference, struct copy, and assignment) is standard C, so any MISRA violation for language extensions would originate in those referenced definitions."
