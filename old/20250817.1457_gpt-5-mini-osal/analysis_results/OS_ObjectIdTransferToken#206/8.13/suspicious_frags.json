  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and their const qualification. The only places in this function that involve pointer parameters or pointer dereferencing are the function signature (pointer parameters) and the two statements that read from and write to those pointers. These are the relevant fragments for investigation. Other lines in the snippet are comments, braces, or non-pointer operations and therefore are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and do not need to be investigated."
