  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code intentionally modifies *token_from (token_from->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE), so token_from must be a pointer to a mutable OS_object_token_t; making it a pointer to const would prevent the required update. Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types only when possible \u2014 here that is not possible because the object is being modified. (If token_from were meant to be input-only, then modifying it would indicate a violation and the parameter should be declared as pointer to const.)"
