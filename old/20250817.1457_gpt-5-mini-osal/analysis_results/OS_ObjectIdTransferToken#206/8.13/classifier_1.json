  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: in this function both pointers are used to modify the pointed-to objects (token_to is written via the assignment and token_from is later modified via token_from->lock_mode = ...), so neither parameter can or should be const-qualified. A specific violation would be if token_from were only read (no later write) but still declared as a non-const pointer \u2014 in that case it should be declared as const OS_object_token_t *token_from."
