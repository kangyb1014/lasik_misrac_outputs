  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. In the function both parameters are used to modify the pointed objects: *token_to is overwritten and token_from->lock_mode is assigned a new value. Because the pointers refer to objects that are modified, they must not be declared as pointers to const \u2014 so Rule 8.13 is not violated."
