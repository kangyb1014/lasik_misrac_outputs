  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_ObjectIdTransferToken can violate the MISRA rule about string.h functions (out-of-bounds accesses), the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The complete typedef/struct layout is essential. If the struct contains embedded char arrays, pointers to strings, or other subobjects, a plain struct assignment (*token_to = *token_from) could copy those members and the analysis must know their sizes and types to reason about any subsequent string.h usage or potential out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: Definition (macro/enum) and the type of the lock_mode field. Needed to verify that token_from->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE is a valid assignment (no hidden function calls or conversions) and to confirm lock_mode exists at the expected type/offset.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew: Allocation/initialization routine for tokens. Required to understand how token objects are created (size, initialization of members, whether dynamic allocation or object pools are used) so we can reason about the valid lifetime and bounds of the token objects that are copied.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: Routine that returns token pointers by id. Needed to trace provenance of token pointers passed into OS_ObjectIdTransferToken (to check whether pointers reference full token objects or sub-objects/overlapping memory).\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFromToken and OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken: Converters/lookup helpers that produce or interpret tokens. These are needed to trace how tokens are obtained or transformed before being passed to the transfer routine (aliasing, partial-object pointers, or special encodings could affect safety).\n\n- OS_ObjectIndexFromToken: May affect how tokens map into tables or memory regions; needed to detect cases where token pointers might be pointers into indexed arrays or sub-structures (possible partial-object references).\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew and OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: Finalization routines that run after allocation/deallocation. Required to understand whether the token contents are modified (e.g., populated with string data via string.h functions) or whether finalization does special copying that could interact with this transfer.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdRelease: Release/cleanup routine. Needed to reason about lifetime and reuse of token storage (e.g., whether token_to and token_from could alias the same memory due to pooling or recycling), since aliasing/overlap matters when copying data and when later string operations run.\n\n- OS_DoTimerAdd and OS_TimerDelete: The immediate callers (present in the static call graph). Their bodies are needed to see how they obtain and pass token_from / token_to (do they pass pointers to subfields, do they pass overlapping pointers, are there preceding or following string.h calls that operate on the token contents). This contextual information is necessary to prove absence (or presence) of any string.h based out-of-bounds accesses in the real call sequences.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine: the exact memory layout being copied, how token objects are allocated/returned, whether the pointers can be partial/overlapping, and whether any of the functions in the allocation/initialization/finalization chain use functions from <string.h> on the same objects \u2014 all required to conclude whether the MISRA rule is violated."
