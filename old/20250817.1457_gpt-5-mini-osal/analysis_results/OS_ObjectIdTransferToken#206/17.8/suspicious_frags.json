  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The rule forbids modifying function parameters themselves (and in the case of pointer parameters it allows modification of the object pointed to but not the pointer value). In OS_ObjectIdTransferToken there are no assignments to the parameter variables token_from or token_to (no reassignments such as token_from = ... or token_to = ...). The statements present (*token_to = *token_from; and token_from->lock_mode = OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE;) modify the objects pointed to by the parameters, which is permitted by the rule. Therefore no fragment in the function violates Rule 17.8."
