  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter token is already a pointer to a const-qualified type (const OS_object_token_t *). The buffer parameter is passed to read() which writes into it, so it must be a non-const void * (making it const would be incorrect). The address of operation is passed to OS_SelectSingle_Impl presumably for modification, so it must be non-const. The read() call requires a non-const buffer by the POSIX API. The call to strerror() returns a non-const char * per the C library API and is used only for logging. Other scalar variables (return_code, os_result, operation) are non-pointer types and not relevant to this rule."
