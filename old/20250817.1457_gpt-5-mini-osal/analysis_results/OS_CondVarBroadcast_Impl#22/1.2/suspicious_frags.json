  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specific points: \n- The function definition and return type (int32) are standard C usages (int32 is assumed a typedef, not a language extension). \n- The static inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken uses the inline keyword, which is part of standard C (C99 and later), not a compiler extension. \n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is a plain preprocessor macro; use of the C preprocessor is standard, not an extension. \n- Use of pthread types and functions (pthread_cond_t, pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_mutex_t) are POSIX library APIs, not compiler language extensions. They are not compiler-specific language extensions documented as such. \n- Array definition OS_impl_condvar_table[...] and struct definitions are standard C. \n- No gcc/clang/MSC-specific keywords or builtins are present (for example: __attribute__, __asm, typeof, __inline__ (nonstandard variants), statement expressions ({:}), nested functions, or other vendor-specific extensions). \nTherefore there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
