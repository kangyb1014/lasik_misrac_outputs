  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameter token is already const-qualified (const OS_object_token_t *token), and there are no other pointer declarations or uses in the function beyond those listed. The remaining items in the additional code are plain type definitions and the status variable; therefore only the reported fragments warrant review for whether pointers should instead point to const-qualified types."
