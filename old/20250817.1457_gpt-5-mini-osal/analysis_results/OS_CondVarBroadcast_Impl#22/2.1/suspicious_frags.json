  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the supplied function or the related definitions. Reasoning:\n\n- The function OS_CondVarBroadcast_Impl contains two return paths that are both conditionally reachable at runtime: a return OS_ERROR when pthread_cond_broadcast returns a non-zero status, and a return OS_SUCCESS when it returns zero. Neither path is a compile-time constant that would render the other branch unreachable.\n\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]. In this usage the macro is invoked as OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_condvar_table, *token). The expression *token is an lvalue, so taking its address yields the original pointer; there is no implicit creation of a temporary that would make subsequent code unreachable. The index is computed via OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token), which reads token->obj_idx at runtime, so array indexing is not a constant that could make code unreachable.\n\n- The helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken simply returns token->obj_idx; it does not contain any unconditional control flow (like an infinite loop or a compile-time constant condition) that would make subsequent code unreachable.\n\n- There are no constructs such as if (0), if (false), goto/labels that are never targeted, code after unconditional returns within the same block, or infinite loops that would make following code unreachable in the provided fragments.\n\nNote on related concerns (not about unreachable code): dereferencing an invalid token pointer or out-of-bounds indexing into OS_impl_condvar_table would be undefined behavior at runtime, but that is not a MISRA Rule 2.1 (unreachable code) violation. These runtime-safety issues should be checked separately (pointer validity, token range checks) but do not indicate unreachable code in the given fragments."
