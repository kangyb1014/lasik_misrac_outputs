In the provided project OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl is defined to unconditionally return OS_SUCCESS and has no side effects on sock_prop or token. In OS_SocketGetInfo the name and creator fields are already copied before the call, and the return_code would remain OS_SUCCESS if the call were removed; hence executing this call does not affect program behaviour and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void write_hex_line(FILE *f, const void *buf, size_t n)\n{\n    const unsigned char *p = (const unsigned char *)buf;\n    size_t i;\n    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n    {\n        /* print without separators to keep a compact snapshot */\n        fprintf(f, \"%02X\", p[i]);\n    }\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n}\nstatic void probe_log_state(const char *tag,\n                            unsigned int sock_id_val,\n                            const void *token_ptr,\n                            const void *record_ptr,\n                            const void *prop_ptr,\n                            const void *prop_snapshot,\n                            size_t prop_size,\n                            int32_t return_code)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1978.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        /* If logging fails, avoid changing program behavior. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"--- OS_SocketGetInfo LOG: %s ---\\n\", tag);\n    fprintf(f, \"sock_id=%u, token_ptr=%p, record_ptr=%p, return_code=%d\\n\",\n            sock_id_val, token_ptr, record_ptr, (int)return_code);\n\n    if (prop_ptr != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"sock_prop pointer=%p, snapshot_size=%zu\\n\", prop_ptr, prop_size);\n        /* Dump the raw bytes of the socket property structure to capture all fields reliably */\n        write_hex_line(f, prop_snapshot, prop_size);\n    }\n\n    fflush(f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_SocketGetInfo(osal_id_t sock_id, OS_socket_prop_t *sock_prop)\n{\n    OS_common_record_t *record;\n    OS_object_token_t   token;\n    int32               return_code;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(sock_prop);\n\n    memset(sock_prop, 0, sizeof(OS_socket_prop_t));\n\n    /* Log initial state after zeroing the output structure */\n    {\n        /* Snapshot the (zeroed) structure */\n        unsigned char snapshot_before[sizeof *sock_prop];\n        memcpy(snapshot_before, sock_prop, sizeof *sock_prop);\n        probe_log_state(\"after_memset\", (unsigned int)sock_id, (void *)&token, NULL, sock_prop, snapshot_before, sizeof *sock_prop, -1);\n    }\n\n    /* Check Parameters */\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sock_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        record = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_global_stream_table, token);\n\n        strncpy(sock_prop->name, record->name_entry, sizeof(sock_prop->name) - 1);\n        sock_prop->creator = record->creator;\n\n        /* Take a snapshot of sock_prop just before calling the implementation hook */\n        unsigned char prop_before[sizeof *sock_prop];\n        unsigned char prop_after[sizeof *sock_prop];\n        memcpy(prop_before, sock_prop, sizeof *sock_prop);\n\n        probe_log_state(\"before_OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl\", (unsigned int)sock_id, (void *)&token, (void *)record, sock_prop, prop_before, sizeof *sock_prop, return_code);\n\n        return_code = OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl(&token, sock_prop);\n\n        /* Snapshot after the call */\n        memcpy(prop_after, sock_prop, sizeof *sock_prop);\n\n        probe_log_state(\"after_OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl\", (unsigned int)sock_id, (void *)&token, (void *)record, sock_prop, prop_after, sizeof *sock_prop, return_code);\n\n        /* Record whether the implementation call changed the sock_prop buffer */\n        {\n            int changed = (memcmp(prop_before, prop_after, sizeof *sock_prop) != 0);\n            FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1978.txt\", \"a\");\n            if (f)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl changed sock_prop? %s\\n\", changed ? \"YES\" : \"NO\");\n                fprintf(f, \"Final return_code=%d\\n\", (int)return_code);\n                fprintf(f, \"--- end log entry ---\\n\\n\");\n                fclose(f);\n            }\n        }\n\n        OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_SocketGetInfo.

  "explanation": "Agent A's claim cannot be accepted as correct on the evidence given. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour, but whether the call OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl(&token, sock_prop) is such an operation depends on the whole project, not just the snippet. The snippet shows a hook call that could legitimately have side effects (modify sock_prop, inspect token, touch global state, affect timing, perform logging, be overridden by a target-specific implementation, be a weak symbol, etc.). Agent A's scenario asserts that in their build the implementation is a trivial no-op, but they did not provide the project-wide proof that the function is always inert and that its removal would not change behaviour (including timing). Without that project-level evidence the report is not justified. If you can demonstrate that in the complete project OS_SocketGetInfo_Impl is unconditionally a no-op, has no side effects, is never overridden/used, and timing effects are irrelevant, then the call would be dead code and would violate Rule 2.2. As presented, the report is not correct."
