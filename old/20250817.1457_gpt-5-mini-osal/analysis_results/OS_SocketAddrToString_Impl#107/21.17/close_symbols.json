  "explanation": "For checking whether OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl can cause out-of-bounds string writes (MISRA rule about string.h functions), the next analyst must be able to determine the maximum number of bytes inet_ntop may write, and whether the buffer and buflen passed in are sufficient and correctly originate from valid objects. Explanations for each symbol:\n\n- inet_ntop: The target writes the textual address using inet_ntop. The prototype and semantics (how many bytes it writes, NUL-termination, return-on-error semantics) are required to decide whether buffer/buflen usage can overflow.\n\n- INET_ADDRSTRLEN: Standard macro defining the required buffer size for IPv4 textual representation. Needed to compare against buflen passed for AF_INET cases.\n\n- INET6_ADDRSTRLEN: Standard macro defining the required buffer size for IPv6 textual representation. Needed to compare against buflen for AF_INET6 cases.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: Definition of the socket address object (including AddrData member) is required to ensure that casting &Addr->AddrData to OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t is safe and to know the lifetime/size of the buffer into which addrbuffer points.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: Definition of this accessor (members sa, sa_in, sa_in6 and their types/sizes) is required to verify that addrbuffer (e.g. &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr or &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr) points to valid memory of appropriate size and alignment.\n\n- AF_INET: Value/meaning of this macro to confirm branch selection and to map to expected address family behavior for inet_ntop.\n\n- AF_INET6: Same as AF_INET for IPv6 path; also needed to reason whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled/active.\n\n- OS_SocketAddrToString: The wrapper that calls the Impl variant \u2014 its implementation/prototype is needed to see how buffer and buflen are provided to OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl (e.g., any pre-checks, fixed-size buffers, or lengths passed).\n\n- OS_CreateSocketName: A direct caller of OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl. Its implementation must be inspected to find actual buffer allocations, sizes passed as buflen, and any truncation/length-check behavior which affect whether inet_ntop could overrun the buffers.\n\n- OS_SocketBindAddress and OS_SocketAccept: Callers of OS_CreateSocketName; include these to trace farther back to possible buffer allocation sites or calling contexts that supply buffer pointers/lengths to OS_CreateSocketName (to determine concrete buffer sizes and lifetimes).\n\n- OS_strnlen: Used by OS_CreateSocketName (per the static call graph) \u2014 its usage may influence how lengths are computed/passed downstream; include to check for off-by-one or misuse that could allow passing an insufficient buflen.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: Feature macro that controls whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled; needed to know whether IPv6 handling (and therefore INET6_ADDRSTRLEN requirements) is relevant in the built configuration.\n\nNote: Return-code macros (OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS) are not required to analyze buffer bounds for this MISRA rule; they are irrelevant to string-overrun analysis and therefore omitted."
