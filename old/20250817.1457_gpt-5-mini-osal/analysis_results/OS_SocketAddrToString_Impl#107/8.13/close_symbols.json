  "explanation": "For assessing the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, the next analyzer needs the concrete type and qualification information for the objects whose addresses are taken and for the called API that receives the pointer:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: needed to see the declaration of Addr and specifically the AddrData member so we can determine how const qualification on the function parameter (const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr) propagates to the underlying storage.\n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t): included separately because AddrData may be an array/union of bytes; its declared type affects whether taking &Addr->AddrData and casting to an accessor yields a const-target pointer.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: required to know the exact types of the accessor fields (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) and whether those member types are const-qualified in the typedef/struct.\n- struct sockaddr (sa): needed to confirm the type and constness of sa.sa_family and to understand how Accessor->sa is declared.\n- struct sockaddr_in (sa_in): needed to see the type of sin_addr and whether it is declared const in that context.\n- struct in_addr (sin_addr): required to know the base type being pointed at when &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr is taken, and whether that type is const-qualified.\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (sa_in6): same reason as sockaddr_in for the IPv6 case.\n- struct in6_addr (sin6_addr): required to know the base type for &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr and its constness.\n- inet_ntop (prototype): required because its second parameter type (const void *) determines whether passing addrbuffer (declared const void *) matches the API and whether a non-const->const pointer conversion happens; this affects the const-correctness assessment.\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: included to resolve which union/field is selected by the switch; not directly about constness but needed for full understanding of which member's address is used in each case.\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: to know whether the AF_INET6 case is compiled in (affects which symbols must be inspected).\n\nWith these definitions the analyzer can determine (a) the effective const qualification of the memory whose address is taken via the Accessor (taking into account the const on the Addr parameter), (b) the declared type of the pointer variable addrbuffer, and (c) the prototype of inet_ntop to confirm whether the pointer is passed to an API expecting a const pointer. This information is necessary to decide if any pointer should have been declared to point to a const-qualified type but is not."
