  "explanation": "I selected all code fragments that declare or assign pointers (or pass pointer arguments) where const-qualification vs non-const may be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. These include the function parameter list (pointer parameters), the local pointer declarations, the cast taking the address of Addr->AddrData, the assignments taking addresses of union/struct members, the switch that indexes into Accessor via a pointer, and the call to inet_ntop which passes those pointers. Other fragments in the function (case labels, return statements, break statements, the AF_INET/AF_INET6 labels, and simple control flow) do not declare or use pointer types in a way that affects const-qualification and therefore are not relevant to Rule 8.13; they already either use const-qualified pointers where applicable or do not involve pointer-to-object types that could/should be const-qualified, so they do not require investigation for this specific rule."
