  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (memcmp shall not be used to compare null-terminated strings) as it applies to this function, the following symbols are needed and why:\n\n- inet_ntop: This external/library function is called directly; its prototype/implementation is required to confirm (a) it is the only string-related stdlib call here, (b) whether it could internally call memcmp on strings (to detect indirect violations), and (c) that it produces a NUL-terminated C string in 'buffer' (relevant to any later comparisons).\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The function casts Addr->AddrData to this accessor type and accesses fields through it. Its definition is required to verify that the accessed members (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) are binary address structures (not char* or NUL-terminated strings), so no memcmp-on-strings occurs when taking addrbuffer.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: The source Addr object layout (AddrData) must be known to ensure the cast to the accessor is valid and that no hidden string fields are involved in the accessed memory.\n\n- struct in_addr and struct in6_addr: These types are what addrbuffer points to for AF_INET/AF_INET6. Their definitions confirm these are binary address containers (byte arrays / integers) rather than NUL-terminated strings; comparing those with memcmp would be allowed (not a MISRA string comparison) or at least not a comparison of C-strings.\n\n- sa_family_t (or the exact type of Accessor->sa.sa_family): Needed to confirm the semantics of the family field and that the switch only selects binary-address cases (AF_INET/AF_INET6) and cannot select a string-based alternative.\n\n- AF_INET, AF_INET6, OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: These macros/constants determine the compiled code paths. Knowing whether AF_INET6 code is present (via OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6) is required to ensure all possible addrbuffer selections are binary-address types (and thus not C-strings) over all build configurations.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: The function returns these symbols. Knowing their definitions is useful to confirm normal/early-exit behavior (i.e., the function does not perform any string comparisons itself before returning), and that no hidden wrapper logic modifies behavior that could introduce memcmp usage.\n\nTogether, these symbols let an analyst determine whether this function (directly or indirectly via inet_ntop) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, and whether the pointers/objects handled are C-strings or binary data (which is the MISRA concern)."
