  "explanation": "For a MISRA check that only language-standard constructs are used (no compiler extensions), the analyzer must inspect the concrete type and macro definitions used by the function so it can detect any non\u2011standard extensions. Reasons per symbol:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: the function casts to this accessor type and accesses nested members. Its definition must be inspected to detect any use of compiler extensions (anonymous unions/structs, zero-length arrays, flexible array members implemented as extension, GCC/clang __attribute__ annotations, packed pragmas, etc.).\n- OS_SockAddr_t: contains AddrData and is the original type of Addr; its definition may contain extensions (attributes, nonstandard members) or unconventional layout that justify the cast.\n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t): the code takes &Addr->AddrData and casts it. If AddrData is declared as a zero-length array or with nonstandard compiler extensions, that would be a language extension violation.\n- struct sockaddr / sa_family / sa_family_t: Accessor->sa.sa_family is used in the switch. The exact type and declaration (including any compiler-specific typedefs or unusual declarations) must be checked for extensions.\n- struct sockaddr_in, struct sockaddr_in6, struct in_addr, struct in6_addr: the code takes addresses of sin_addr / sin6_addr members via the Accessor. Their definitions (possibly provided by system headers) can contain anonymous unions/structs or compiler attributes that are language extensions.\n- AF_INET, AF_INET6: these macros come from system headers. Their definitions must be normal macros/integers and not provided via nonstandard mechanisms.\n- inet_ntop: the function is called. The prototype/availability may come from POSIX/system headers \u2014 the declaration should be checked to ensure no nonstandard extension or macro trickery is being relied upon.\n- size_t: standard typedef; verify it comes from standard headers and not a compiler-specific typedef alias.\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: conditional compilation affects code shape. Its definition or use could hide nonstandard constructs; verify it is a plain compile-time macro.\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: error-code macros/enum values returned by the function; ensure they are normal macros/enum constants and not defined using compiler extensions.\n- compiler-specific attributes/macros used in the above definitions (e.g. __attribute__, __packed__, pragma pack, anonymous unions/structs): explicitly request inspection of any attribute or pragma tokens used in the type/macro definitions, since these are the common forms of language/compiler extensions that would violate the MISRA rule.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions allows the next agent to determine if any nonstandard language extensions (anonymous/unnamed members, zero-length arrays as extension, compiler attributes/pragmas, or other vendor-specific constructs) are present in the types/macros the function depends on."
