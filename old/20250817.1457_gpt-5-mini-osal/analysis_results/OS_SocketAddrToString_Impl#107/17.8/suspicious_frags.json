  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified in the provided function. Specific checks: \n- The parameters are: char *buffer, size_t buflen, const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr. There are no statements that reassign buffer, buflen, or Addr (no buffer = ..., buflen = ..., Addr = ...). \n- inet_ntop writes through the memory pointed to by buffer (modifying the object referred to by the pointer), but it does not modify the pointer variable itself; this is permitted by the rule. \n- Accessor is a local pointer initialized from &Addr->AddrData via a cast; this uses Addr but does not modify the Addr parameter (no assignment to Addr). The cast changes the pointer type but not the parameter. \n- There is no pointer arithmetic or increment/decrement on any of the pointer parameters. \nTherefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the shown code."
