  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe assignment to return_code after calling OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete is redundant. OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete returns the same operation_status value passed in (it performs side effects like unlocking and notifying but does not alter the status), so writing its return back into return_code has no effect on behavior \u2014 removing the assignment (while still calling the function for its side effects) would not change program behavior. Thus the write is dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_MutSemDelete code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1746.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_MutSemDelete as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_MutSemDelete:\n```c\nint32 OS_MutSemDelete(osal_id_t sem_id)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n    int32             return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, sem_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_MutSemDelete_Impl(&token);\n\n        /* Complete the operation via the common routine */\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(return_code, &token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_MutSemDelete code.\n",
