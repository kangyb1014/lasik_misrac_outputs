  "explanation": "I reviewed the provided code paths for unreachable code (MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1). No code fragments appear to be statically unreachable for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_MutSemDelete: Execution can either follow the if(return_code == OS_SUCCESS) branch or skip it and return the code from OS_ObjectIdGetById; neither path is statically impossible.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdGetById: The early return on non-success (return return_code) is intentional. The subsequent if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS) block is only entered when conversion succeeds; there is no code after a guaranteed return or a constant-false condition that would make a statement unreachable.\n\n- OS_MutSemDelete_Impl: The branch on status (status != 0 vs else) depends on the runtime result of pthread_mutex_destroy; both outcomes are possible and thus reachable.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete: Both branches of the if (operation_status == OS_SUCCESS) are valid runtime outcomes (success vs failure). The calls to OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish and OS_NotifyEvent occur in well-defined conditional places; there is no dead code following guaranteed returns or constant conditions.\n\nNo constant conditions, no code after an unconditional return, and no mutually exclusive branches that can never be entered were found in the supplied fragments. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation specifically for unreachable-code violations of MISRA Rule 2.1.\n\nNote: There are other potential logic concerns (for example, the use of token->obj_id after OS_ObjectIdTransactionFinish when final_id was set to OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED), but these are not instances of unreachable code and thus outside the scope of Rule 2.1."
