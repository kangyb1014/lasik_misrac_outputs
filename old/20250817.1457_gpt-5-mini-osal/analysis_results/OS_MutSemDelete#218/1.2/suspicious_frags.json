  "explanation": "I did not find any compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragments. The function and related declarations use standard C constructs only: typedefs (int32 alias of int32_t and osal_id_t as uint32), a forward-declared struct typedef, macro constants (OS_SUCCESS), a normal function definition, local variables, function calls, and standard return statements. I looked specifically for common compiler extensions that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2, such as: __attribute__ or __declspec annotations, inline assembler (asm), GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, nested functions, label-as-value, compiler-specific keywords or builtins (e.g. __builtin_*), nonstandard #pragmas shown in code, or other vendor-specific extensions. None of these appear in the supplied code. The ellipses (...) in the additional snippet indicate omitted unrelated content; they are not actual code and therefore not an extension. Consequently there are no suspicious fragments to escalate for further investigation under Rule 1.2."
