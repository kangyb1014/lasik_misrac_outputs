  "explanation": "The function OS_TimeBaseDelete has a single formal parameter (timer_id) which is never assigned to or otherwise modified in the function body \u2014 it is only passed by value to other routines. All pointer usages in this function are addresses of local variables (e.g. &token) passed to called functions; these are not formal parameters of OS_TimeBaseDelete itself, so MISRA C:2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter shall not be modified) is not violated here. Calls to OS_TaskGetId_Impl, OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl, OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_TimeBaseDelete_Impl and OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete only use returned values or pass pointers to local objects; there are no assignments to timer_id or any other formal parameter to investigate."
