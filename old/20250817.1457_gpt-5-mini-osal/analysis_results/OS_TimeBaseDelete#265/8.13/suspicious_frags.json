  "explanation": "No other pointer expressions or pointer-typed variables appear in this function. Calls that pass values (e.g. OS_ObjectIdToType_Impl(OS_TaskGetId_Impl())) use non-pointer scalar arguments. Local declarations (return_code, objtype, token) are non-pointer objects except for the explicit &token uses listed above. Therefore, aside from the three &token occurrences, there are no additional pointer targets in this code that could be qualified const and thus no other fragments need investigation for Rule 8.13."
