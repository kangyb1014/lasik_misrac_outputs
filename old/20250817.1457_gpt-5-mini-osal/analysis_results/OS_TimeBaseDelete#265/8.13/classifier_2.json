  "scenario": "No violation in this call as written. The call passes &token (a modifiable OS_object_token_t *) to OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete. If that function needs to modify or consume the token (unlock, clear, etc.) then a non-const pointer is correct and MISRA 8.13 is not violated. The only way a rule violation would exist is if OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete does not modify the token but its parameter is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. int32 OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(int32, OS_object_token_t *t)); in that case the function signature (not this call site) should use a pointer to const, and the lack of const in the prototype would violate Rule 8.13."
