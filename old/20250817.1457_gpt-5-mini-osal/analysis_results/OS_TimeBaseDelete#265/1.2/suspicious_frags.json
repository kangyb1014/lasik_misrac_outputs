  "explanation": "I examined the function and related symbol definitions for use of compiler-specific language extensions. The code contains only standard C constructs: typedefs, integer macros and literals, variable declarations, function calls, comparisons, and return statements. There are no uses of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm / inline assembly, __builtin_*, __typeof__, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, __extension__, __declspec, pragma GCC/clang/msvc extensions, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
