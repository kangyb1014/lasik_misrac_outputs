  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the supplied code. The only function parameter in OS_CloseFileByName is Filename (const char *), and it is: - Checked for NULL via OS_CHECK_POINTER(Filename) which expands to a BUGCHECK expression and does not assign to or modify Filename. - Used only in a strcmp(stream->stream_name, Filename) call (read-only use). There are no assignments to Filename, no pointer arithmetic on Filename, and it is declared const, preventing modification of the pointed-to characters. Other mutated objects (iter, stream, return_code, close_code, msg_buffer in OS_printf, etc.) are local variables, not function parameters, so MISRA C Rule 17.8 does not apply to them. The additional OS_printf code also does not modify its pointer parameter (String) \u2014 it only checks it and passes it to other functions. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8."
