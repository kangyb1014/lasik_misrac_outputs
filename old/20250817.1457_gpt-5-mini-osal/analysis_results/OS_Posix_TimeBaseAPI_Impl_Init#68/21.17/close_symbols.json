This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- OS_impl_timebase_table (complete declaration/definition): The call to memset uses sizeof(OS_impl_timebase_table). To determine whether memset writes exactly the intended object or overruns memory we must know if this symbol is an actual array/object (and its size) or merely a pointer. The concrete declaration shows the object size that sizeof yields.\n\n- Type definition of the elements of OS_impl_timebase_table (struct type showing member 'handler_mutex' and full layout): If the table is an array of structs, the element layout and size are needed to ensure the memset length and subsequent indexed accesses (OS_impl_timebase_table[idx].handler_mutex) are within bounds and that zeroing the object is appropriate.\n\n- OS_MAX_TIMEBASES: The for-loop iterates up to OS_MAX_TIMEBASES; to ensure the loop index cannot exceed the actual array bounds we must know this constant and verify it matches the array length (or otherwise confirm indexing is safe).\n\n- pthread_mutex_t (definition/type): The struct elements contain a pthread_mutex_t member. Knowing the type and whether it is valid to zero-initialize the containing structure (and that sizeof covers it) is necessary to reason about memory layout and potential out-of-bounds effects when combined with memset.\n\n- memset (prototype from <string.h>): The MISRA rule applies to standard string.h functions. Include the prototype to be explicit about parameter types and that this is the library function being invoked.\n\n- strerror (prototype) and errno (symbol): strerror is used in debug messages. Although it does not write into user buffers here, including its prototype and errno definition helps rule out any misuse of string functions that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses in the same function.\n\n- POSIX_GlobalVars (definition) and member ClockAccuracyNsec (type): The code writes to POSIX_GlobalVars.ClockAccuracyNsec. While not directly a string operation, its type and size confirm this write does not conflict with any buffer addressed by memset or other string functions.\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars (definition) and members TicksPerSecond and MicroSecPerTick (types): These members are assigned based on sysconf and used in arithmetic. Their definitions ensure no aliasing with the memory region zeroed by memset and confirm no indirect out-of-bounds write via these assignments.\n\n- sysconf prototype and _SC_CLK_TCK: sysconf is called and its result tested; include its prototype and the constant to ensure the code path (and any side effects) do not lead to buffer misuse.\n\n- clock_getres prototype, OS_PREFERRED_CLOCK and struct timespec definition: clock_getres writes into clock_resolution (struct timespec). Knowing the timespec layout and clock_getres semantics confirms the code never causes writes beyond the bounds of clock_resolution (a local object) and that checking tv_sec/tv_nsec is valid.\n\nIncluding these symbols allows the next analyst to determine whether memset (and other string.h functions used) operate on correctly sized objects and do not access beyond the referenced objects, as required by the MISRA C rule."
