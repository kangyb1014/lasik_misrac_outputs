  "explanation": "For MISRA C check about pointer const-qualification you must know the declarations/prototypes and types of all objects and functions that involve pointers in this function, so you can tell whether pointers could or should be const. Brief reasons for each symbol:\n\n- OS_impl_timebase_table: the array passed to memset and indexed for handler_mutex; need its element type to know whether it or its members are (or should be) const and whether memset use is modifying non-const data.\n- OS_MAX_TIMEBASES: size/loop bound for indexing OS_impl_timebase_table; needed to understand array extent and whether indexing could produce pointer-to-const issues.\n- memset: prototype (void *memset(void *, int, size_t)); to know whether the function expects a non-const void* (it does) and thus whether passing the object as non-const is required/appropriate.\n- clock_getres: prototype (int clock_getres(clockid_t, struct timespec *)); to see whether second parameter must be non-const (it is, because it is an out parameter) so &clock_resolution usage is justified.\n- OS_PREFERRED_CLOCK: the clockid_t value passed to clock_getres; included to confirm correct overload/type and whether pointer usage to that API is appropriate.\n- struct timespec: definition (tv_sec, tv_nsec) to confirm that clock_getres writes into it (so pointer must be non-const) and to inspect member types used (tv_sec, tv_nsec) for further constness considerations.\n- strerror: prototype (char *strerror(int)); signature determines whether the returned pointer is const-qualified; MISRA may prefer const char * for literal/static strings \u2014 need to know actual prototype used.\n- errno: declaration (int errno or macro) to see whether errno is used as an lvalue or passed by address anywhere; also to interpret strerror(errno) usage.\n- pthread_mutexattr_init: prototype (int pthread_mutexattr_init(pthread_mutexattr_t *)); needed to check whether it modifies the attr object (non-const parameter) so taking &mutex_attr is correct.\n- pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol: prototype (int pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(pthread_mutexattr_t *, int)); to know whether it requires a non-const pointer or could accept a const pointer.\n- pthread_mutexattr_t: type definition to know whether it is an object type that should be mutable and whether pointers to it could be const.\n- pthread_mutex_init: prototype (int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *, const pthread_mutexattr_t *)); the const-qualification of parameters (notably the attr pointer) must be known to judge if passed &mutex_attr could be const-qualified earlier.\n- pthread_mutex_t: type definition to determine whether handler_mutex is an object or pointer type and whether it should be const-qualified (normally it is an object to be initialized/mutated \u2014 non-const).\n- PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT: constant used with pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol; included to fully understand that API usage and examine constness of arguments.\n- sysconf: prototype (long sysconf(int)); to see it expects an int and returns long; while not pointer-heavy, needed because its return is used to set shared globals \u2014 ensure no hidden pointer issues.\n- _SC_CLK_TCK: macro passed to sysconf; included for completeness of API usage.\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars: definition of the global struct to see types and constness of members TicksPerSecond and MicroSecPerTick and whether they are objects that should be modified (non-const) or could be const.\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond: specific member used and assigned; need its declared type (signed/unsigned, integer width) to ensure proper assignment and whether it is mutable.\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.MicroSecPerTick: specific member assigned; need declared type to decide if it should be non-const.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars: definition of this global struct to confirm that ClockAccuracyNsec field exists and whether it is intended mutable.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.ClockAccuracyNsec: the field written from clock_resolution.tv_nsec; its declared type (uint32) determines whether the assignment is valid and whether the field should be const.\n- uint32: typedef for the integer width used \u2014 needed to confirm constness and signed/unsigned semantics in assignments.\n- osal_index_t: typedef used for idx loop variable; its type impacts pointer/index usage analysis (e.g., indexing into arrays) and any const-related indexing concerns.\n- int32: return type typedef; included to ensure return value constants/types are consistent with function contract (not pointer-related but part of symbol set).\n- OS_DEBUG: logging macro/function prototype to determine how string arguments (e.g., strerror(...) results or format strings) are accepted (const char * vs char *) and whether passing non-const pointers could be qualified const.\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR, OS_TIMER_ERR_INTERNAL: return-code macros/constants to understand control flow and whether any pointer-returning APIs are involved in error handling.\n\nIn short: include all API prototypes and type/structure definitions for any object or function that either receives or returns pointers (or that is memzeroed/assigned), plus the global structures and typedefs used. With these declarations the next analyzer can determine where pointers are modified/returned and whether they could or should be declared as pointing to const-qualified types under MISRA C guidance."
