  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8. Reasoning:\n- The function parameters are: const OS_object_token_t *token, const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr, int32 timeout.\n- There are no assignments to the parameter variables (no occurrences of token = ..., Addr = ..., or timeout = ...). The parameters are only read or dereferenced.\n- The pointer parameters are not reassigned. The local pointer variable sa is assigned the address of Addr->AddrData, but this assigns to a local variable (sa), not to the parameter Addr itself; it does not modify the pointer parameter.\n- The objects referred to by the pointer parameters are only read (e.g., *token used to index table, Addr->ActualLength read); there is no modification of *token or contents of *Addr.\n- Calls that take addresses (e.g., &operation, &sockopt, &slen) use local variables, not function parameters.\n\nTherefore, no fragments in this function violate the requirement that function parameters shall not be modified."
