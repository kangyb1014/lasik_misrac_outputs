  "explanation": "No uses of the string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code. The only invocation that might be considered a string-library call is strerror(errno) in the debug logging, but strerror takes an integer and returns a pointer to an internal static message buffer (it does not accept a pointer to user-supplied data), so it cannot cause out-of-bounds accesses of objects referenced by pointer parameters and thus is not relevant to Rule 21.17. Other places that might be questioned for buffer/length safety have explicit length checks or use correctly sized local objects: - The sockaddr pointer (sa) is derived from Addr->AddrData, and the code checks Addr->ActualLength against the expected slen for AF_INET/AF_INET6 before calling connect, preventing passing an excessive length. - Before getsockopt the code sets slen = sizeof(sockopt), so the buffer/length pair is consistent. - OS_SelectSingle_Impl uses FD_SET/FD_ZERO and does not call any string.h functions.\nGiven the absence of string.h pointer-parameter calls that could read/write user-supplied buffers, there are no fragments that need to be investigated for MISRA Rule 21.17."
