  "scenario": "The pointer 'impl' is declared as a non-const pointer but is only used for read access (impl->fd, impl->selectable) in this function. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be const-qualified to prevent accidental modification (e.g. declare: const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl). If the object genuinely needs to be modified through this pointer elsewhere in the function, const would be inappropriate, but in the shown code it is not modified, so the lack of const is a rule violation."
