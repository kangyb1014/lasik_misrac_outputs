  "explanation": "No fragments violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function. The rule forbids modifying the function parameter (the pointer variable) itself; it allows modification of the object referred to by a pointer parameter. In this code: \n\n- ListHead->NumberOfTags and ListHead->Tags[i] only access members of the object pointed to by ListHead (permitted).\n- UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]) passes the address of a member for possible modification of the pointee (permitted by the rule).\n- free(ListHead) deallocates the object referred to by the pointer; this modifies the pointed-to object/lifetime but does not modify the pointer parameter variable itself (permitted under the rule).\n\nThere is no assignment to ListHead, no pointer arithmetic on ListHead, and no attempt to set the parameter variable to a new value; therefore nothing in this function requires investigation for Rule 17.8."
