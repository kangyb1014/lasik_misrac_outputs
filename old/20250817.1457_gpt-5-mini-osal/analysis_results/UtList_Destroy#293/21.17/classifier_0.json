  "scenario": "The statement free(ListHead) does not call any function from <string.h>. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 applies only to the standard string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), so this code fragment does not violate Rule 21.17. (Note: other issues such as ensuring ListHead was dynamically allocated or not already freed are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
