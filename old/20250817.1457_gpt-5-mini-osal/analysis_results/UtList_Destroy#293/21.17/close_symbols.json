  "explanation": "Explanation:\n- UtList_Reset (implementation): The target function passes &ListHead->Tags[i] to UtList_Reset. To determine if any string.h call will read/write beyond the tag object, we must inspect UtList_Reset's code for uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/strncpy/strlen/etc. and how it computes sizes/lengths.\n- UtList_DeleteNode (implementation): UtList_Reset calls UtList_DeleteNode (per the call graph). Any string.h usage inside UtList_DeleteNode (or its logic altering sizes/offsets) can cause out-of-bounds accesses originating from the Reset call; the implementation is therefore required.\n- UtListHead_t (full type/struct definition): The layout of UtListHead_t (especially NumberOfTags and Tags member declaration) is required to know the nominal number of elements and the memory layout so we can judge index validity and object bounds for Tag elements.\n- Type/definition of ListHead->Tags element (the struct/type of Tags[i]): To check whether string functions operate within the bounds of a tag element we need the exact element type and sizes of any character buffers or subobjects inside the tag structure.\n- Declaration/definition of Tags storage (array/flexible-array member or sized array) and any size/count macros: We must know whether Tags is a fixed-size array, a flexible array, or a pointer to separately allocated memory, and any compile-time macros controlling element counts or buffer lengths; these determine the actual bounds available for string operations.\n- Function(s) that allocate/initialize UtListHead_t and set NumberOfTags and Tags storage size (e.g. UtList_GetHead / creation routine): NumberOfTags drives the loop in UtList_Destroy; to ensure the loop does not pass out-of-range elements to UtList_Reset we need the allocation/initialization site that determines how many Tags elements were actually allocated/initialized relative to NumberOfTags.\n- All direct callees of UtList_Reset and UtList_DeleteNode (their implementations) that might call <string.h> functions: Any nested helper that uses memcpy/strcpy/etc. is relevant because the MISRA rule targets standard string functions. The full chain of implementations is needed to see size arguments, source/destination buffers, and any arithmetic that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nProvide these symbols/definitions to the next analyzer so it can inspect uses of <string.h> functions, the sizes of destination/source objects, and the allocation/initialization invariants that ensure indices and buffer lengths are safe."
