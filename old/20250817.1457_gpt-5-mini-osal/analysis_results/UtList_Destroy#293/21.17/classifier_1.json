  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function declaration (void UtList_Destroy(UtListHead_t *ListHead)) does not call any functions from <string.h>, so Rule 21.17 is not applicable. A violation would occur only if the function body used string.h routines (e.g., memcpy, strcpy) in a way that could access beyond the bounds of the objects pointed to by its parameters."
