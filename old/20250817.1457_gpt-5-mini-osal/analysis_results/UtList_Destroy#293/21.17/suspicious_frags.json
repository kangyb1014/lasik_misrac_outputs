  "explanation": "The source contains no direct calls to the <string.h> functions named by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The only places that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses related to those functions are the call that passes an element of ListHead->Tags to another routine (UtList_Reset) and the loop that indexes Tags by NumberOfTags; those are listed above and must be investigated (UtList_Reset implementation, validity of NumberOfTags and size of Tags array). Other fragments in the function are not relevant to Rule 21.17: the local declaration (uint32 i) and the loop control/increment syntax do not involve string.h functions or pointer parameters, and no other string-handling calls are present in this function body, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 21.17."
