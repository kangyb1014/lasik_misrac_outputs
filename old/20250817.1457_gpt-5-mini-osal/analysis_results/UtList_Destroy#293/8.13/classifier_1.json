  "scenario": "Not violated: UtList_Destroy uses and frees the object pointed to by ListHead (reads NumberOfTags, passes addresses of Tags to UtList_Reset, then calls free(ListHead)), so the pointee must be mutable and cannot reasonably be const-qualified. A violation would be if the function only read the pointee and did not modify or free it but still declared UtListHead_t * instead of const UtListHead_t *."
