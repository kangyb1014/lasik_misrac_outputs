  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not declare or pass pointer types that could/should be const-qualified: - The local variable declaration 'uint32 i' is not a pointer. - The loop control expressions (for (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i)) only read a member; the relevant pointer usage for potential const-qualification is covered by the reported 'UtListHead_t *ListHead' fragment. - The call to 'UtList_Reset' itself is represented by the passed argument '&ListHead->Tags[i]', so its internal implementation/signature should be inspected separately if needed. - No other pointer declarations or pointer-typed expressions appear in the function body that would be candidates for adding const qualification."
