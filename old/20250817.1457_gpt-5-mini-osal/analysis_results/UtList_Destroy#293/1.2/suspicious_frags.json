  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the presented fragment. Details:\n- No implementation-specific keywords or tokens are present (e.g. __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembly, or other compiler intrinsics).\n- The identifier uint32 is a user typedef name, not a language extension token; its use is a normal type name and not an extension per se (its definition would be project-local). If it maps to a standard fixed-width type (e.g. uint32_t) or a typedef, that is ordinary C usage.\n- Array indexing (ListHead->Tags[i]), pointer usage (ListHead), function call (UtList_Reset), and free() are standard C/library usage, not extensions.\n- The for loop and pre-increment (++i) are standard C constructs.\n\nNote: If the underlying definition of Tags in UtListHead_t used a zero-length array (e.g. Tags[0]) that would be a compiler extension on some compilers; that declaration is not visible in this fragment, so it cannot be reported here. Similarly, any extension would need to appear as explicit extension syntax in the shown code to be reported under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
