  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code is present in the provided function. There are no return statements, break/goto labels, infinite loops, or constant conditions that would make any statement impossible to execute. The for-loop body may be skipped at runtime when ListHead->NumberOfTags == 0, but that is a dynamic condition (the loop body is not intrinsically unreachable). The final free(ListHead) statement is reachable whenever the function is entered (there is no early exit), so it is not dead code. Although dereferencing ListHead without a null check could lead to undefined behaviour if a NULL pointer is passed, that is not an example of unreachable code and thus is outside the scope of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Therefore there are no fragments that must be investigated specifically for unreachable-code concerns."
