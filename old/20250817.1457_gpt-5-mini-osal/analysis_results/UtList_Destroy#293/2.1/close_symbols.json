  "explanation": "- UtListHead_t: Needed to know the type and semantics of ListHead->NumberOfTags and the Tags member (array vs pointer, allocation/size relationships). These determine whether the for-loop can execute, be skipped, or behave unexpectedly (which affects reachability of later statements such as free()).\n- uint32: The loop index type affects iteration/wrap behavior and comparison semantics with NumberOfTags (signed/unsigned mismatch can produce infinite loops or skipped code), which is relevant when deciding if parts of the function can be unreachable.\n- UtList_Reset: The body and declaration (including attributes such as noreturn) are required to determine whether calls inside the loop ever return. If UtList_Reset does not return (calls exit/longjmp/abort or is annotated noreturn), the remainder of the function (subsequent iterations or free(ListHead)) could be unreachable.\n- UtList_DeleteNode: UtList_Reset calls this function; its behavior (especially any non-returning control flow) is needed when analyzing whether UtList_Reset can return to UtList_Destroy.\n- free: The project may redefine free as a macro or provide an implementation with nonstandard control flow. Its declaration/definition is needed to confirm that the final free(ListHead) returns normally and does not make subsequent code unreachable (or indicate other semantic constraints).\n- UtTest_Run: To decide whether the function itself is ever invoked in the build, the caller implementation is needed. If UtList_Destroy is not actually reachable from any entry point in the final build/configuration, the entire function could be unreachable.\n- OS_Application_Run: Include upstream caller(s) (e.g., OS_Application_Run) to complete the call chain used to assess whether UtList_Destroy is reachable from program entry points.\n\nThese symbols together allow analysis of (a) intrafunction reachability (does control flow inside the function lead to unreachable statements) and (b) interprocedural reachability (is the function reachable from program entry), which are both required to determine conformance with the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code."
