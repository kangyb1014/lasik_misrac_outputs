Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Reasoning for each required symbol:\n\n- UtListHead_t (structure definition): The for-loop condition uses ListHead->NumberOfTags and the body indexes ListHead->Tags[i]. To determine whether the second clause (i < ListHead->NumberOfTags) uses an object that is modified in the loop body (directly or indirectly) we must know the exact fields, their types and locations. The structure definition shows the declaration and types of NumberOfTags and Tags and whether there are any implicit relationships (e.g., parent pointers) that could allow functions called in the body to modify NumberOfTags.\n\n- uint32 (typedef): The loop counter i is declared as type uint32. MISRA concerns include that the loop counter is a proper integer object and that its modifications are only via the third clause. The typedef may reveal qualifiers (e.g., volatile) or unusual width/semantics that affect whether ++i is the only modification and whether the counter meets MISRA requirements.\n\n- Type of ListHead->Tags[] elements (e.g., UtListTag_t): UtList_Reset is called with &ListHead->Tags[i]. The behavior of UtList_Reset (and any side effects on the containing list or NumberOfTags) may depend on the element type. The element definition can reveal embedded pointers to the parent ListHead or other back-references that UtList_Reset/DeleteNode could follow to modify NumberOfTags or other objects used in the loop clause.\n\n- UtList_Reset (function definition/body and prototype): The MISRA rule treats the behavior of called functions as part of the loop body. To know whether the loop counter i or objects used in the second or third clause (e.g., ListHead->NumberOfTags or Tags[]) are modified inside the body, we must inspect UtList_Reset for side effects. In particular, if UtList_Reset modifies ListHead->NumberOfTags (directly or indirectly) or modifies any object used by the loop clauses, the for loop could violate the rule.\n\n- UtList_DeleteNode (function definition/body and prototype): The static call graph shows UtList_Reset calls UtList_DeleteNode. Side effects that affect loop well-formedness might be in UtList_DeleteNode rather than UtList_Reset itself. Therefore the full body of UtList_DeleteNode must be inspected to determine if it modifies NumberOfTags, the Tags array, or any object used in the loop clauses.\n\n- Any global variables accessed or modified by UtList_Reset or UtList_DeleteNode (list all names and definitions): If those functions change global objects that are referenced in the for second or third clause (or the loop counter), the loop may not be well-formed. The analysis needs the names and definitions of any globals read or written by those functions so the caller can verify that the second clause has no persistent side effects and that objects used there are not modified by the loop body (including called functions).\n\nNote: Inspecting the above symbols (the full definitions/bodies) is sufficient to determine whether: (a) the second clause uses only allowed objects and has no persistent side effects, (b) the third clause modifies only the loop counter, and (c) no object used in the loop clauses is modified by the loop body or by functions called from it, which are the MISRA concerns for a well-formed for loop."
