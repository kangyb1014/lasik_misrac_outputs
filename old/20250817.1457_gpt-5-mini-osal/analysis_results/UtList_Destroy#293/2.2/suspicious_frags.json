Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

Other agents can not investigate other fragments that you do not report, so it is very important to find all suspicious fragments without missing any.

    "for (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i)\n    {\n        UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]);\n    }",

  ],
  "explanation": "Do not investigate the remaining fragments because they are either syntactic/structural or demonstrably used: the function header (void UtList_Destroy(UtListHead_t *ListHead)) is a normal externally visible definition and cannot be classified as dead without whole-project call-graph information; the declaration 'uint32 i;' is actually used by the loop and therefore not dead; the opening/closing braces and return-less end of function are structural and not executable statements on their own; there are no other executable statements in this function. The listed fragments are the only places where executable actions occur and therefore are the only candidates that could be executed yet redundant (per Rule 2.2) and merit further investigation."
