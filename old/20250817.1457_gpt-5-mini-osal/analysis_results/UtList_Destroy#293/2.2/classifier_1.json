  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_Destroy:\n```c\nvoid UtList_Destroy(UtListHead_t *ListHead)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i)\n    {\n        UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]);\n    }\n    free(ListHead);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nUtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "In general this call is not dead code because UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]) is executed and (presumably) has side effects that affect program behaviour (e.g. releasing resources, unregistering callbacks, updating hardware state, decrementing refcounts). Therefore removal would likely change behaviour and Rule 2.2 is not violated. However, it would be a violation if UtList_Reset has no observable effect \u2014 for example if its body is an empty stub, or it only zeroes fields of the tag structure that are immediately discarded when free(ListHead) is called and those writes have no externally observable effect. In that specific case the call would be dead code and would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
