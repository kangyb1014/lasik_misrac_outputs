  "explanation": "To decide whether operations inside UtList_Destroy are dead code you must know whether those operations have externally observable effects. Specifically:\n\n- UtListHead_t (structure definition): Needed to confirm what NumberOfTags and Tags actually are (types, range, ownership semantics). If NumberOfTags or Tags is an alias to shared/global data, the loop and free may have side effects; conversely if Tags is unused data the loop could be dead.\n\n- Type of ListHead->Tags[] elements (the tag/node struct/type used in Tags): You must inspect the element type to see whether resetting each element changes global or observable state (e.g., clears pointers, decrements counters, releases resources). Without the element type you cannot judge whether iterating/resetting them matters.\n\n- UtList_Reset (function implementation): UtList_Destroy's behaviour depends entirely on what UtList_Reset does. If UtList_Reset has side effects (mutating globals, freeing resources, updating counters, logging, timing), then the loop is not dead. If it is a no-op or only modifies memory that is immediately freed and never observed, it might be dead.\n\n- UtList_DeleteNode (function implementation called by UtList_Reset): UtList_Reset calls this function; it may perform the real side effects (resource release, global updates). You must inspect it to understand the net effect of each reset call.\n\n- Functions that allocate/initialize UtListHead_t instances (where ListHead is created): To judge whether free(ListHead) affects program behaviour you need to know ownership and lifetime: who allocates ListHead, whether other code retains pointers into it, and whether freeing it is required. The creators/initializers provide that context (e.g., whether ListHead is transient, reused, or globally referenced).\n\n- UtTest_Run (caller implementation): Inspecting callers shows how UtList_Destroy is used in practice. If callers depend on the cleanup performed by Destroy (e.g., rely on side effects, or expect memory to be freed to force subsequent behaviour), removal of the calls would change behaviour. If callers never observe those effects, Destroy may be dead.\n\n- Global variables or counters read/modified by UtList_Reset/UtList_DeleteNode (any names used): Any global state mutated by the reset/delete operations (counters, registry tables, handles) makes the operations observable. You must locate and examine those globals to determine if the operations are necessary.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions lets the next analyst determine whether the loop body and the free() call produce observable effects; if they do, the code is not dead under the MISRA rule; if they do not, the code (or parts of it) could be considered dead and subject to removal."
