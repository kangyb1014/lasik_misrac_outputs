Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_Destroy:\n```c\nvoid UtList_Destroy(UtListHead_t *ListHead)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i)\n    {\n        UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]);\n    }\n    free(ListHead);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nfor (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i)\n    {\n        UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]);\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "Not inherently violated. The loop is not dead code in general because it invokes UtList_Reset on each tag before freeing the list\u2014these calls may have externally visible effects (release resources, notify other modules, set flags) and so removing them could change behaviour. However, a concrete violation scenario exists: if UtList_Reset has no side effects (e.g. it only zeroes fields that are immediately discarded) and there are no other references to the tag elements, then executing the calls has no effect on program behaviour and they are dead code. Similarly, if UtList_Reset is an empty function (or is optimized out) then the loop body would be dead code."
