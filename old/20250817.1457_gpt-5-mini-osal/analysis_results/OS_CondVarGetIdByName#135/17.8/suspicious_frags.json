  "explanation": "No code fragment in the provided functions modifies a function parameter itself. In OS_CondVarGetIdByName the pointer parameters var_id and var_name are only passed to macros and to OS_ObjectIdFindByName; neither pointer variable is assigned to or otherwise altered. The OS_CHECK_POINTER macro expands to BUGCHECK((ptr)!=NULL, ...), which only evaluates the expression and does not change the pointer. Inside OS_ObjectIdFindByName the only write involving a pointer parameter is the assignment *object_id = token.obj_id; which modifies the object referred to by the pointer (allowed by the rule), not the pointer parameter itself. The const char *name parameter is only checked and passed through and is not modified. Therefore there are no fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the supplied code."
