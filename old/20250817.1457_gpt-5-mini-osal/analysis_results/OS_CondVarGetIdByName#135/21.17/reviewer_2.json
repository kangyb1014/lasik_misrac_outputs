  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_CondVarGetIdByName code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_CondVarGetIdByName.\n```c\nint32 OS_CondVarGetIdByName(osal_id_t *var_id, const char *var_name)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(var_id);\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(var_name);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdFindByName(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_CONDVAR, var_name, var_id);\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:If LENGTHCHECK is implemented using an unbounded string function such as strlen(name) to test length (e.g. if (strlen(name) >= OS_MAX_API_NAME) ...), and the caller provides a char buffer of size OS_MAX_API_NAME that contains no terminating '\\0' (or otherwise the string is not NUL-terminated within the object bounds), the strlen call will read past the bounds of the object and thus violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. For example, a caller passes a buffer of exactly OS_MAX_API_NAME bytes filled with non-zero characters and no NUL terminator \u2014 strlen will scan beyond the buffer.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_CondVarGetIdByName_LogEntry(const void *var_id, const char *var_name)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1087.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"OS_CondVarGetIdByName ENTRY\\n\");\n        fprintf(f, \"  var_id ptr = %p\\n\", var_id);\n        fprintf(f, \"  var_name ptr = %p\\n\", (const void *)var_name);\n        /* Log only the first byte (if any) to avoid unbounded reads.

  "explanation": "The reported violation is not supported by the code shown. The function OS_CondVarGetIdByName as given does not call any of the <string.h> routines listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17; it only checks pointers (OS_CHECK_POINTER) and forwards the name to OS_ObjectIdFindByName. Rule 21.17 only applies where string.h functions (e.g. strlen, strcpy, memcpy, etc.) are actually used in a way that can read beyond the bounds of the referenced objects.\n\nThe agent's scenario is plausible in principle \u2014 if some macro or the called function (e.g. a LENGTHCHECK macro or OS_ObjectIdFindByName) used an unbounded function such as strlen on a buffer that is not NUL-terminated within its object bounds, that use would violate Rule 21.17. However that would be a defect in the implementation of that macro/function, not in the wrapper OS_CondVarGetIdByName itself (unless the API contract of OS_CondVarGetIdByName guaranteed a NUL-terminated input and that contract is violated). To determine a real MISRA violation you must inspect the implementation of OS_CHECK_POINTER, LENGTHCHECK, and OS_ObjectIdFindByName (or any other code that consumes var_name) to see whether they call unbounded string functions without ensuring the object contains a NUL within its bounds.\n\nRecommendation: review the implementations of OS_ObjectIdFindByName and any length-check macros. Ensure they either:\n- require and document a NUL-terminated string and validate this safely (e.g. use strnlen with the maximum allowed length and check the result), or\n- avoid unbounded string.h calls and use bounded forms (strnlen, memchr with explicit size) so no read can go past the object bounds.\n\nGiven only the supplied code, the agent's report is not correct."
