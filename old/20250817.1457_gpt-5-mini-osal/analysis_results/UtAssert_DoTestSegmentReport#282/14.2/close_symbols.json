Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "For checking compliance with the MISRA rule on well\u2011formed for loops you must be able to show that no for loop in the target function (or any function/macro expanded/called from it) violates the three clauses. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: Called twice from the target. Need its definition (or macro expansion) to ensure it is not a macro hiding a for loop, and to check whether it modifies any objects that could act as loop counters or control flags when called from a loop in this function.\n- UT_BSP_Lock / UT_BSP_Unlock: These are called by UT_BSP_DoText (per call graph). Inspect them to ensure they do not contain for loops or side effects on objects that could be used as loop counters/control flags.\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl / OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl / OS_BSP_Shutdown_Impl: Transitive callees of UT_BSP_DoText. Their bodies must be inspected for any for loops or side effects that could interact with a for loop in the caller (or be hidden via macros).\n- UtAssert_GetCaseTypeAbbrev: Transitive callee of UT_BSP_DoText. Need its definition to ensure it contains no problematic for loops or side effects.\n- UtAssert_TestCounter_t: The target indexes into TestCounters->CaseCount and reads TestSegmentCount/TotalTestCases. The structure/type definition is needed to confirm CaseCount is a plain array (no overloaded/macro behaviour), that indexing uses constant indices, and that there are no hidden operations/macros involved that could contain loops or modify loop counters.\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_* constants (ABORT, WARN, FLOW, DEBUG, N/A, INFO, END, PASS, FAILURE, MIR, TSF, TTF): These identifiers are used as array indices and as arguments to UT_BSP_DoText. Their definitions (enum or #define) must be checked to ensure they are compile\u2011time constants with no side effects (important when reasoning about expressions used as loop conditions or increments if similar expressions appear in a for header).\n- snprintf: Standard library function (or macro on some platforms). Verify whether it is a macro or inline wrapper that could expand to code containing loops or side effects that matter for MISRA analysis.\n\nIn short: obtain the full definitions/implementations (or macro expansions) of the functions called directly (UT_BSP_DoText) and their transitive callees, the TestCounter type, the case\u2011type constants, and the snprintf declaration/expansion. These symbols are needed to rule out any hidden for loops or side effects that would affect whether any for loop (present here or in called/macro\u2011expanded code) satisfies the MISRA clauses."
