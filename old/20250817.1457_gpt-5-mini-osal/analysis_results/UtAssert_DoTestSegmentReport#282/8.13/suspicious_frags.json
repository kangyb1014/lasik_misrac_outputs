  "explanation": "The function parameters SegmentName (const char *) and TestCounters (const UtAssert_TestCounter_t *) are already const-qualified, so they comply with Rule 8.13 and do not require investigation. The ReportBuffer array is written to by snprintf, so it must be a modifiable char[] (cannot be const) and the snprintf calls therefore are not violations. The format string literals passed to snprintf are inherently constant and the snprintf prototype expects a const char * for the format, so those are not suspicious. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer parameters in this function. The only places to investigate for potential Rule 8.13 issues are the two calls that pass ReportBuffer to UT_BSP_DoText \u2014 check UT_BSP_DoText's prototype/implementation to confirm whether it should accept a pointer to const char instead of a non-const char * (i.e., whether the callee modifies the string)."
