  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 prohibits using the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. In the provided function there are no calls to memcmp (nor any explicit memory-comparison operations) \u2014 only snprintf and UT_BSP_DoText are invoked. The SegmentName is passed to snprintf with %s (string formatting), not compared via memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that match the rule violation and nothing to report for investigation. (If memcmp were used inside UT_BSP_DoText or elsewhere, that would be outside the scope of this function and would need to be inspected in those implementations.)"
