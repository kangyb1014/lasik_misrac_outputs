  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function parameters are used only for read access: SegmentName is passed to snprintf and not assigned to or incremented/decremented, and TestCounters is dereferenced to read fields (modifying the object pointed-to would be permitted by the rule, but this code only reads values). There are no assignments to the pointer parameters (no statements like SegmentName = ... or TestCounters = ...), no pointer arithmetic on them, and they are not cast to a non-const pointer or passed to a callee in a way that would modify the pointer itself. Therefore no code in this function appears to violate Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be further investigated for that rule."
