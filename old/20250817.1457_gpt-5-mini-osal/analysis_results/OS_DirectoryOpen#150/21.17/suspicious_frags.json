  "explanation": "The remaining lines in OS_DirectoryOpen do not perform string handling or pass character buffers to routines that obviously perform string/byte-copy operations, so they are not relevant to MISRA Rule 21.17. Specifically: parameter checking (OS_CHECK_POINTER), object allocation/finalization calls (OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew), table access (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET), local variable declarations (token, dir, return_code), and the function prologue/return do not themselves invoke <string.h> functions or manipulate character arrays. The four reported fragments and the macro definition are the points where a buffer is created, a path string is copied/translated, or a name is initialized/passed to other routines that are likely to use string.h routines and thus must be inspected for potential out-of-bounds accesses (including whether the buffer size macro accounts for required terminators)."
