  "explanation": "The only pointer in this function that is not const-qualified and that is used to access data is 'impl' (a pointer to an element of the global OS_impl_task_table). The function only reads impl->id and does not modify the table entry, so the pointer could be to a const-qualified type (e.g., const OS_impl_task_internal_record_t *). Other fragments need not be investigated: the function parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' is already const-qualified; OS_ObjectIdFromToken and OS_ObjectIdToInteger operate on/return values, not non-const pointers; pthread_detach takes a pthread_t by value (impl->id is read-only here); and OS_DEBUG is a macro with no effect in this build. The macro invocation OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_task_table, *token) merely yields the address of the table element and does not change the constness of the token parameter. No other pointer-bearing expressions in the function could be qualified const without changing semantics, so they are not suspicious for Rule 8.13."
