  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Reasoning:\n- The control flow contains a single conditional (if (ret != 0)) with two reachable outcomes: pthread_detach can return 0 or a non-zero error code at runtime, so both the error-return branch (return OS_ERROR) and the success-return branch (return OS_SUCCESS) are potentially executed depending on runtime behavior.\n- There are no constant boolean conditions, no code after an unconditional return within the same block, no infinite loops that prevent later statements from executing, and no fall-through labels creating unreachable statements.\n- The OS_DEBUG invocation is a macro defined as empty in the provided additional code; this means the preprocessor removes that call and its argument expressions before compilation rather than leaving unreachable code in the compiled translation unit. Consequently there is no unreachable code produced by that macro in the compiled output.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and token/address operations are evaluated at runtime and do not introduce statically unreachable code.\n\nGiven these points, there are no code fragments in the provided source that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
