  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specific checks performed:\n- No GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, __builtin_*, statement-expression ({ ... }), nested functions, computed goto, or similar constructs are present.\n- The variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) uses standard C99 variadic-macro syntax, which is not a compiler extension.\n- The pthreads usage (pthread_detach, pthread_t) and strerror are POSIX/library APIs, not compiler language extensions; per the instruction only explicit compiler language extensions (as documented by the compiler) should be reported.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and its use (&tbl[...], passing *token) are standard C expressions/macros, not extensions.\n- The use of types like int32 or user typedefs (pthread_t, OS_impl_task_internal_record_t, OS_object_token_t) are type names/typedefs, not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions)."
