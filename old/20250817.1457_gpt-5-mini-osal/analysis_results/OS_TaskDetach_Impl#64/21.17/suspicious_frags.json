  "explanation": "Only the use of functions from <string.h> (or their results) can be relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. In the provided function, the only occurrence related to <string.h> is the call to strerror(...) used inside the OS_DEBUG call. No other standard string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the target function or the supplied related definitions. The table access and token handling use macros and inline functions that do not perform string operations; pthread_detach usage and the assignment of impl and ret do not involve <string.h> functions. The OS_DEBUG macro is shown as empty in the supplied snippet, so there is no evidence of additional string-buffer operations in this excerpt. Therefore, other fragments do not need investigation under Rule 21.17 based on the provided code."
