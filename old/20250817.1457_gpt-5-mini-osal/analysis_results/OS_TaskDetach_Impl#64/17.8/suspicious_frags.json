  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not modify the function parameter. The function signature declares the parameter as a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token), which prevents modification of the object referred to. There are no assignments to 'token' (no token = ..., token++/--, or pointer arithmetic) anywhere else in the function. The pthread_detach call uses impl->id (not the parameter), the variable declarations only declare local variables, the ret check and return statements do not modify the parameter, and strerror(ret) operates on the local ret value. The two reported fragments are the only places in this function where the parameter is accessed and therefore warrant investigation for possible modification of the parameter or its pointer."
