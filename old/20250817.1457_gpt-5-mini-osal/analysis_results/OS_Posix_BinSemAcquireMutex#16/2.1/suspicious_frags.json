  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Each statement can be reached depending on runtime conditions: the struct declaration is executed on every call; the first if either returns on clock_gettime failure or continues on success; timeout modification executes when clock_gettime succeeds; the second if either returns on pthread_mutex_timedlock failure or continues on success; the final return is executed when both calls succeed. The constant definitions shown (OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS, OS_SEM_FAILURE, OS_SUCCESS) do not introduce compile-time conditions that would make any of these statements unreachable. Therefore there are no code fragments that warrant further investigation for Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
