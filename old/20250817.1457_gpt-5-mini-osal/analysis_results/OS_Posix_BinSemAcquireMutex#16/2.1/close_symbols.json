  "explanation": "- clock_gettime: need the function prototype and documented return semantics (which values it can return) to decide whether the first if(condition) can be deterministically always true or always false (i.e. whether either branch is unreachable).\n- CLOCK_REALTIME: macro value/definition (may be significant if it is redefined in target build) to know the actual argument passed to clock_gettime; used when reasoning about any platform-specific behavior that could make clock_gettime a constant no-op.\n- OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS: numeric value and type. Adding this to timeout.tv_sec could overflow or be a no-op depending on the constant; knowing its value is required to determine whether the timed wait call is reachable or whether UB/constant folding makes later code unreachable.\n- pthread_mutex_timedlock: prototype and return-value semantics (which return codes are possible/guaranteed) to decide whether the second if(condition) can be always true/false and thus whether the following return is reachable.\n- pthread_mutex_t: definition/alias (if it is a macro or alias to something with special behavior) to ensure the timedlock call is not transformed by macros/inline wrappers that could make calls/returns unreachable.\n- struct timespec: full definition (tv_sec member type) to check types and whether the tv_sec addition is well-defined or could be optimized away / cause UB that affects reachability.\n- time_t (tv_sec type and limits): knowing signedness and range/limits is necessary to reason about possible overflow of timeout.tv_sec + OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS and whether that leads to undefined behaviour or constant results impacting reachability.\n- OS_SEM_FAILURE: numeric value. If this equals OS_SUCCESS (or otherwise identical to the other return), one of the return statements may be effectively unreachable or redundant; must know exact value to decide.\n- OS_SUCCESS: numeric value for same reason as OS_SEM_FAILURE.\n- int32 (typedef): underlying type definition (signedness/width) to ensure returned constants fit and to reason about any implicit conversions that could affect constant propagation and unreachable-code analysis.\n\nThese symbols cover function/macro definitions, constant values and type definitions that can make a conditional always true/false, merge return values, or introduce undefined behavior \u2014 all of which are required to decide if any branch or return in OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex is unreachable under the project build."
