  "explanation": "- pthread_mutex_timedlock prototype: Needed because the const-qualification requirement for the parameter 'mut' depends on how that pointer is used. If pthread_mutex_timedlock takes a non-const pthread_mutex_t * (as in POSIX), then 'mut' must be non-const here (the callee modifies the mutex). If the prototype took a const pointer, making 'mut' const could be possible. The prototype is the key symbol to determine whether 'mut' can be const.\n- pthread_mutex_t typedef/definition: Required to know whether the type pointed-to is modifiable or has internal const constraints. Even if opaque, its typedef shows that the object represents mutable mutex state and is not a candidate for const qualification when used with pthread_mutex_timedlock.\n- clock_gettime prototype: Included to show the treatment of the 'timeout' object and confirm that &timeout is passed to a non-const parameter (clock_gettime takes struct timespec *), so that operation is a write to timeout. This demonstrates that the timeout object (and its address) is legitimately non-const in this function, which is relevant to the general MISRA consideration of using const where possible.\n- struct timespec definition: Needed to see the member types and to confirm that timeout is a modifiable object (tv_sec is incremented). This supports the conclusion that the timespec instance cannot be const in this function.\n- clockid_t typedef: Provided because clock_gettime's prototype references clockid_t; including it ensures the clock_gettime symbol is fully resolved if the analyst needs the exact prototype.\n\nIn short: the pthread_mutex_timedlock prototype and the pthread_mutex_t type are the decisive symbols for whether the parameter 'pthread_mutex_t *mut' could/should be const (they show the callee expects and modifies a non-const mutex). The clock_gettime and timespec symbols are included to fully explain why the local timespec is legitimately non-const and to avoid false positives when applying the MISRA rule."
