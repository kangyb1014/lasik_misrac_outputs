    "int32 OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex(pthread_mutex_t *mut)",

  "explanation": "Only pointer-related code must be examined for Rule 8.13. The rest of the function contains non-pointer items (e.g. 'struct timespec timeout;', the arithmetic 'timeout.tv_sec += ...;', and the return statements) which are not relevant to pointer const-qualification and therefore do not need investigation. The three fragments listed are the only places in this function where pointer types are used (the function parameter and calls that pass addresses), so they are the appropriate and complete set of locations to investigate for possible const-qualification."
