  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses only standard C constructs (typedef'd integer type, function definition, pointer parameter, local struct variable, return statements) and calls POSIX library functions (clock_gettime, pthread_mutex_timedlock) and uses POSIX types (pthread_mutex_t, struct timespec). POSIX APIs and types are platform/library features, not compiler language extensions (they are not GCC/Clang/MSC-specific language extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions, inline-assembler, or other vendor keywords). There are no identifiers starting with double underscores, no compiler-specific keywords, no asm blocks, no use of GCC statement expressions or typeof, no variable-length array declarations, and no other known compiler-only language extensions present. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
