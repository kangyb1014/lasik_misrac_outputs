  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule about language/compiler extensions you must inspect the actual declarations/definitions used by the function to see whether any use compiler-specific extensions (eg __attribute__, builtin types, compiler-only keywords, or typedefs to compiler-provided types). Reason for each symbol: \n\n- int32: The function return type. Determine whether int32 is a plain typedef to a standard integer type (e.g. int32_t) or an alias that uses a compiler-specific extension (e.g. __int32 or other non\u2011standard keyword).\n\n- pthread_mutex_t: The mutex object type may be a typedef that includes compiler attributes or vendor extensions; inspect its definition (from pthreads) to ensure no compiler-specific constructs are used.\n\n- struct timespec: The timespec structure and its members (tv_sec/tv_nsec) must be verified to be standard and not defined via compiler extensions or non\u2011standard fields.\n\n- clock_gettime: The declaration could be a macro or have attributes (visibility/aliasing) that are compiler extensions; check its prototype in the headers used by the project.\n\n- CLOCK_REALTIME: A macro constant defined in the headers; confirm it is a plain macro/enum and not implemented via compiler extension.\n\n- pthread_mutex_timedlock: As with clock_gettime, confirm the declaration is a standard POSIX function and not a compiler-specific inline/attribute/macro.\n\n- OS_SEM_FAILURE and OS_SUCCESS: Project-level macros or enum constants used for return values. Their definitions must be checked for any use of compiler extensions (e.g. nonstandard integer types, casting macros, attributes).\n\n- OS_POSIX_BINSEM_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS: Project macro/constant added to timeout.tv_sec. Verify it is a plain integer constant and not built using compiler extensions.\n\n- <time.h> and <pthread.h>: The header sources where timespec/clock_gettime/CLOCK_REALTIME and pthread types/functions are declared. Inspecting these headers (or the project copies/wrappers) is necessary to determine whether compiler-specific extensions are being pulled in via included headers.\n\nCollectively these symbols (types, macros, and function declarations) are the minimal set needed to decide whether the target function itself or any of the referenced types/macros/functions rely on compiler-specific language extensions. Only after inspecting their definitions can you conclude whether the code violates the MISRA prohibition on language extensions."
