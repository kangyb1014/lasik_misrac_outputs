  "explanation": "No occurrences of the standard library function memcmp are present in the provided function or related definitions. The function OS_Posix_BinSemAcquireMutex only calls clock_gettime and pthread_mutex_timedlock and manipulates a struct timespec and integer macros; it does not perform any string operations, character-array comparisons, or use of string.h functions. The provided macros and typedefs are numeric and not string-related. Therefore there are no code fragments that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp used to compare null-terminated strings) and no further investigation is required for this rule in the supplied code."
