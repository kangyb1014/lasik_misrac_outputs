Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA C for-loop analysis:\n\n- UT_GENRE_SIZE\n  - This macro/function is used in the switch selector. Its expansion/definition must be inspected because the MISRA rule states the behaviour of any functions called within a statement is part of the statement\u2019s behaviour \u2014 if UT_GENRE_SIZE expands to code (or calls functions) that contain for loops or modify loop counters/objects, that would affect compliance.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_t\n  - The type of the ValueGenre parameter; needed to understand how UT_GENRE_SIZE interprets ValueGenre and whether that interpretation causes any side effects or calls that include for loops.\n\n- UT_ValueGenre_INTEGER, UT_ValueGenre_FLOAT, UT_ValueGenre_POINTER\n  - The enumeration/constants used as arguments to UT_GENRE_SIZE in each case label. Their definitions can influence how UT_GENRE_SIZE behaves (for example if UT_GENRE_SIZE performs different actions based on these values) and must be known to determine whether any called code contains for loops.\n\n- UtAssert_Failed\n  - Called in the default case. The MISRA rule explicitly includes the behaviour of functions called within the statement body; UtAssert_Failed must be inspected for any for loops or side effects that would violate the for-loop well-formedness rule when considered as part of UT_LoadRetval\u2019s behaviour.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext\n  - Appears in the static call-graph as a callee related to the assert facility. UtAssert_Failed (or other assert helpers) may call UtAssert_GetContext; since called functions\u2019 behaviour is part of the statement, any for loops inside UtAssert_GetContext could affect compliance and therefore it must be checked.\n\n- UT_RetvalBuf_t\n  - The structure type of the Buf parameter (fields Integer, FloatingPt, Ptr). The definitions of its members may involve accessors/inline functions/macros; those could contain loops or side effects. Inspecting the struct/type ensures there are no hidden function calls with loops when reading Buf->... fields.\n\n- int8, int16, int32, int64\n  - The integer types used in the casts/assignments. While primitive types themselves do not introduce loops, their typedefs could be macros or mapped to types with attributes or accessors on some platforms; include them to rule out hidden expansions that might contain loops or side effects.\n\n- float, double, void *, size_t, bool\n  - Fundamental types used in sizeof, pointer casts, parameters and return type. Include to ensure there are no platform-specific macro redefinitions or wrappers that could introduce function calls or loops impacting the analysis.\n\nNotes/Scope\n- The goal is to identify any code that contributes to the behaviour of UT_LoadRetval (including macros, inline functions, and functions it calls) that might contain for loops or modify objects used as loop counters. The above list focuses on symbols that can expand into code or call other functions; primitive built-in operators (sizeof, casts) need no separate symbol, unless they are implemented via macros on the platform \u2014 in which case the corresponding typedef names above cover that possibility."
