  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the evidence provided. The code shown (OS_SocketConnect) declares stream as OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream and later writes to the pointed object (stream->stream_state |= ...). That use requires a non-const-qualified pointee, so OS_SocketConnect itself does not violate Rule 8.13.\n\nThe agent's claim actually refers to a different function (OS_SocketConnect_Impl) and a local variable named impl, but the implementation of OS_SocketConnect_Impl was not provided. The supplied instrumentation did not produce any log output for OS_SocketConnect, so it gives no evidence about the impl variable or its usages. Without seeing the OS_SocketConnect_Impl source and all uses of impl (including any calls that may take a non-const pointer or any writes) one cannot conclude that the pointer should be declared const. If OS_SocketConnect_Impl truly only reads the pointee and never passes it to APIs requiring a non-const pointer, then making the pointer-to-const would be appropriate; however that is a potential issue in Impl, not in the shown OS_SocketConnect, and cannot be confirmed from the data provided.\n\nTherefore the report as stated (that the shown OS_SocketConnect code violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13) is incorrect. To settle the matter, review the full OS_SocketConnect_Impl implementation to see whether its local pointer is used only for reads and can be changed to point-to-const, or if there are legitimate reasons it must remain non-const."
