  "explanation": "I examined the target function and all provided related definitions. There is no use of the C standard library function memcmp anywhere in the shown code fragments, nor any code that compares C strings using memcmp. The function OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl only reads fields (current_value) and assigns to sem_prop->value; the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken inline function perform index/address computations and do not call memcmp. The struct definitions (including the name array in OS_bin_sem_prop_t) only declare storage and are not compared here. Therefore there are no fragments in the provided code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
