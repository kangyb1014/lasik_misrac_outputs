Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible (for example: \"const OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem\").\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, OS_bin_sem_prop_t *sem_prop)\n{\n    OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem;\n    FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/99.txt\", \"a\");\n\n    if (log)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"ENTER: OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl token=%p sem_prop=%p\\n\", (void *)token, (void *)sem_prop);\n    }\n\n    sem = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_bin_sem_table, *token);\n\n    if (log)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"After lookup: sem=%p\\n\", (void *)sem);\n        if (sem)\n        {\n            /* Log the current_value read from the sem object to capture state */\n            fprintf(log, \"sem->current_value=%ld\\n\", (long)sem->current_value);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            fprintf(log, \"sem is NULL (lookup returned NULL)\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* put the info into the structure (preserve original behavior) */\n    sem_prop->value = sem->current_value;\n\n    if (log)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"Assigned sem_prop->value=%ld - returning OS_SUCCESS\\n\", (long)sem_prop->value);\n        fclose(log);\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl.

  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the shown implementation the local pointer sem is only used to read data (sem->current_value) and is never used to modify the pointed-to object. Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so declaring it as\n\n    const OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem;\n\nwould be the proper fix. The added logging/test code does not change the usage (it only reads sem->current_value) and the empty log just indicates the function was not exercised by the test \u2014 it does not invalidate the rule violation.\n\nNotes/caveats:\n- Assigning the result of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET (presumably a non-const pointer) to a const-qualified pointer is allowed and preferable here; if the macro/type definitions make this impractical the types/macros should be adjusted instead of leaving the local pointer non-const.\n- If the record can be modified asynchronously by other threads/ISRs, you might want const volatile instead of just const, but that addresses a different concern (visibility to concurrency) and does not negate the recommendation to use const if the local code does not write through the pointer."
