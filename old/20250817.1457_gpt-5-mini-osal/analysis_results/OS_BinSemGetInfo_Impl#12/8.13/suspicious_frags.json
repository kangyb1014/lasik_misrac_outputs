  "explanation": "Fragments not listed for investigation: the function parameter declaration const OS_object_token_t *token is already const-qualified and therefore conforms to the rule; the output parameter OS_bin_sem_prop_t *sem_prop must be writable by this function (it is assigned to), so it cannot be const; the inline function OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already takes a pointer to const OS_object_token_t, so it does not need further investigation. The listed fragments are those that affect whether the pointer to the bin-semaphore record could/should be to a const-qualified type (declaration and use of the local pointer, the macro that obtains the pointer from the table, the table definition itself, the access to the record member, and the volatile member type which affects const/volatile qualification)."
