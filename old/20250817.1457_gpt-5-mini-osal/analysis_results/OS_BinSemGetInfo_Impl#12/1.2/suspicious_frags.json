  "explanation": "The rest of the code uses only standard C constructs: the function signature, pointer declaration (OS_impl_binsem_internal_record_t *sem;), member access (sem->current_value), assignment and return are ordinary C and not compiler-specific extensions. The type names like int32 and the OS_... typedefs/constants are ordinary user typedefs/macros, not language extensions by themselves. No tokens such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof, ({ ... }), __asm__, nested functions, or other known compiler-specific keywords/constructs appear elsewhere in the provided fragments. The two reported fragments should be investigated because the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET may expand to compiler-specific constructs (statement expressions, typeof, etc.), and the array definition could hide use of a non-constant size or compiler-specific extension in its declaration elsewhere; these are the only locations where such extensions are likely to be introduced in the shown code."
