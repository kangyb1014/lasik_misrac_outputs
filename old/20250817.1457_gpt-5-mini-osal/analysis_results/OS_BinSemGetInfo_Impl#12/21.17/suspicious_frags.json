  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the target function or in the provided related definitions. The function OS_BinSemGetInfo_Impl only reads a volatile integral field (sem->current_value) and assigns it to sem_prop->value; this involves no character buffers or string operations. The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and OS_ObjectIndexFromToken use token/index arithmetic to access a table element and do not perform any string handling. The OS_bin_sem_prop_t structure does contain a char name[] member, but no code here writes to or reads from that buffer (and no string functions are used on it in the provided code). Therefore, there are no fragments in the supplied code that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 regarding out-of-bounds accesses from <string.h> functions."
