  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl.\n```c\nvoid OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    size_t                        StartPos;\n    size_t                        EndPos;\n    size_t                        WriteSize;\n    OS_console_internal_record_t *console;\n\n    console  = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_console_table, *token);\n    StartPos = console->ReadPos;\n    EndPos   = console->WritePos;\n\n    OS_BSP_Lock_Impl();\n\n    while (StartPos != EndPos)\n    {\n        if (StartPos > EndPos)\n        {\n            /* handle wrap */\n            WriteSize = console->BufSize - StartPos;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            WriteSize = EndPos - StartPos;\n        }\n\n        OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(&console->BufBase[StartPos], WriteSize);\n\n        StartPos += WriteSize;\n        if (StartPos >= console->BufSize)\n        {\n            /* handle wrap */\n            StartPos = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl();\n\n    /* Update the global with the new read location */\n    console->ReadPos = StartPos;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:Potential violation when OS_Console_CopyOut treats console->device_name as a NUL-terminated C string. device_name is declared as char device_name[OS_MAX_API_NAME]; if it happens to be fully filled without a terminating '\\0' (or otherwise not guaranteed NUL-terminated), any use of string.h functions such as strlen, strcpy, strcat, etc., inside OS_Console_CopyOut would read past the bounds of device_name. Likewise, if OS_Console_CopyOut uses memcpy/memmove to copy data into the ring buffer without ensuring the copy length fits within console->BufSize (using PendingWritePos), it could write beyond the buffer bounds. Therefore, the call return_code = OS_Console_CopyOut(console, console->device_name, &PendingWritePos); can lead to a Rule 21.17 violation in these scenarios.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void Probe_LogOpenDirOnce(void)\n{\n    /* Best-effort create directory; ignore errors (e.g. already exists). */\n    (void)mkdir(\"/tmp/logs\", 0777);\n}\nstatic void Probe_LogConsoleState(const OS_console_internal_record_t *console,\n                                  size_t StartPos,\n                                  size_t EndPos,\n                                  size_t WriteSize,\n                                  const char *stage)\n{\n    Probe_LogOpenDirOnce();\n\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/623.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* If logging fails, do not affect normal operation. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"[OS_ConsoleOutput] stage=%s\\n\", stage);\n    fprintf(f, \"  console=%p, ReadPos=%zu, WritePos=%zu, StartPos=%zu, EndPos=%zu, WriteSize=%zu, BufSize=%zu\\n\",\n            (const void *)console, console->ReadPos, console->WritePos, StartPos, EndPos, WriteSize, console->BufSize);\n\n    /* Log buffer base address and a small peek (up to 32 bytes) at StartPos (but do not read out of bounds). */\n    fprintf(f, \"  BufBase=%p\\n\", (const void *)console->BufBase);\n    if (console->BufBase != NULL && console->BufSize > 0)\n    {\n        size_t max_peek = 32u;\n        size_t avail = console->BufSize;\n        size_t peek = (max_peek < avail) ? max_peek : avail;\n        size_t i;\n\n        /* Determine a safe linear region to print: from StartPos for up to 'peek' bytes, but do not wrap here. */\n        size_t linear = peek;\n        if (StartPos + linear > console->BufSize)\n        {\n            linear = console->BufSize - StartPos;\n        }\n\n        fprintf(f, \"  Buf peek (hex) at StartPos=%zu, len=%zu: \", StartPos, linear);\n        for (i = 0; i < linear; ++i)\n        {\n            unsigned char byte = (unsigned char)console->BufBase[StartPos + i];\n            fprintf(f, \"%02x\", (unsigned)byte);\n            if (i + 1 < linear) fprintf(f, \" \");\n        }\n        fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    /* Attempt to log device_name information without assuming NUL-termination.\n       We will scan for a NUL within the array bounds and print a safe textual representation only if found. */\n    {\n        /* This relies on the console structure having device_name as an array member.\n           If not present in this build, these lines will fail to compile; but in the target\n           environment the field is expected to exist per the violation scenario. */\n        size_t name_size = 0u;\n        /* Use a try to obtain size of the array; if device_name is not an array this line will fail to compile. */\n#ifdef __GNUC__\n        /* Silence unused warnings in some builds */\n        (void)name_size;\n#endif\n        /* We do the check in a way that is safe (no reliance on strlen): */\n        {\n            /* Compute size of device_name array at compile-time via sizeof. */\n            size_t array_bytes = 0u;\n            /* Wrap in a block to avoid breakage if member not present in some builds. */\n            /* If device_name is present as an array, sizeof yields its size; else compilation will fail and needs adaptation. */\n            array_bytes = sizeof(console->device_name);\n\n            /* Scan for NUL within bounds. */\n            size_t i;\n            size_t nul_index = array_bytes; /* default: not found */\n            for (i = 0u; i < array_bytes; ++i)\n            {\n                if (console->device_name[i] == '\\0')\n                {\n                    nul_index = i;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n            if (nul_index < array_bytes)\n            {\n                fprintf(f, \"  device_name: NUL-terminated at index=%zu, length=%zu, text='\",\n                        nul_index, nul_index);\n                /* Safe to print as string since we found NUL within bounds. */\n                fprintf(f, \"%.*s\", (int)nul_index, console->device_name);\n                fprintf(f, \"'\\n\");\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                /* Not NUL-terminated within array bounds.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl code shown does not call any of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17, and the computation of WriteSize ensures the pointer/length passed to OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl represents a linear region that does not extend past the buffer end (if ReadPos/WritePos and BufSize are valid). The scenario offered by agent A describes risks in a different function (OS_Console_CopyOut) and/or in the BSP implementation: if OS_Console_CopyOut or OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl themselves misuse string.h functions (e.g. assume device_name is NUL-terminated or call strcpy/strlen on an unterminated array), then the violation would be in those functions, not in OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl as presented. (Separately, general robustness concerns such as corrupted ReadPos/WritePos/BufSize or a NULL BufBase could lead to out-of-bounds accesses, but these are not instances of Rule 21.17 unless a <string.h> function is involved.)"
