  "explanation": "I selected fragments that can lead to statically- or practically-unreachable code paths or contain condition checks that are likely never true on conforming POSIX implementations and therefore merit investigation for MISRA Rule 2.1.\n\nWhy other fragments were NOT selected:\n- OS_ConsoleWrite and OS_ConsoleCreate control-flow (entry checks, updates to PendingWritePos, OverflowEvents, IsAsync handling, semaphore creation, task creation and cleanup) are ordinary conditional and error-handling paths that are reachable in normal use and do not present obvious statically unreachable code. They should be reviewed for correctness but do not raise immediate Rule 2.1 concerns.\n- The macro and index helper (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken) are simple inline/indexing operations; there is no unreachable branch inside them.\n- The assignment and wrap handling inside the loop of OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl were included as part of the loop fragment because the loop as a whole is the potential source of an infinite loop (if WriteSize can be computed as zero due to edge conditions or data corruption). Individual statements outside that loop (other than the unlock and final write-back, which were included) are not themselves unreachable unless the loop never terminates.\n- The write loop in OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl was included because its break condition (WriteLen <= 0) can cause incomplete progress which in turn could lead to the caller's loop not advancing; the write-loop body itself is reachable and necessary, but its failure branch can have cascading effects on reachability in callers, so it was flagged.\n\nIf desired, further investigation should confirm ABI/OS guarantees (e.g. pthread_mutex_* return value semantics) and invariants on console->BufSize/ReadPos/WritePos to determine whether the flagged branches are truly unreachable or represent defensive/error-handling code that must be retained."
