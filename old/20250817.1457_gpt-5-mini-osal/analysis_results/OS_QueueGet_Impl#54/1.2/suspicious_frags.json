  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no GCC/Clang extensions such as __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, typeof, nested functions, asm, or inline assembly.\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or nonstandard storage-class specifiers; the only use of inline is in a static inline function in the additional code, which is a standard C keyword (C99) and not a vendor-specific extension.\n- All types and functions used (ssize_t, mqd_t, mq_receive, mq_timedreceive, clock_gettime, errno values, etc.) are POSIX APIs or standard types, not compiler language extensions.\n- Macros and casts (e.g., OSAL_SIZE_C) are standard preprocessor usage, not language extensions.\n\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions). If you want, I can re-check for any specific compiler/documentation-known extension if you tell me which compiler toolchain is targeted."
