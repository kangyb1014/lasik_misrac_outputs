  "scenario": "The pointer 'impl' is declared as a mutable pointer (OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t *impl) but in this function it is only used for read access (e.g. impl->id) and the pointed object is not modified. Therefore the pointer could be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type (const OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t *impl). Because the pointer is not const-qualified even though it could be, this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
