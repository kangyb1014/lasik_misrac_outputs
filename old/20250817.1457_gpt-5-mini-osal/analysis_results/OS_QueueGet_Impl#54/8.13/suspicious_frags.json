  "explanation": "These are the only locations where a pointer to an internal record is obtained and subsequently only read. They should be investigated to determine whether the pointer could/should be declared to point to a const-qualified OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t. Other pointers in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: 'data' is an output buffer passed to mq_receive/mq_timedreceive and must be writable (so cannot be const-qualified), 'size_t *size_copied' is an output parameter and must be writable, '&ts' is passed to functions that populate/modify the timespec and memset writes into ts, and 'token' is already declared as const OS_object_token_t *. The NULL/priority argument to mq_receive/mq_timedreceive is intentionally NULL. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for this rule."
