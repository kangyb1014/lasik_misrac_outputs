  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to check for out-of-bounds string.h usage:\n\n- UTASSERT_STRINGBUF_NULL_TERM\n  - The function switches behavior depending on this macro: when equal it uses strlen(String) instead of memchr(..., StringMax). Its exact value/meaning determines whether caller intends the input to be treated as a null-terminated C string and thus whether strlen is appropriate. This affects whether strlen's scan is safe (requires a terminating '\\0' inside the allocated buffer).\n\n- memchr (from <string.h>)\n  - Used to locate '\\0' and '\\n' with an explicit length argument. memchr reads up to the supplied length; if that length is greater than the actual allocated object the call is UB. To determine compliance we must know memchr semantics and check that the third-argument (StringXMax or FormatLen) never exceeds the actual object size.\n\n- strlen (from <string.h>)\n  - Used when UTASSERT_STRINGBUF_NULL_TERM is set. strlen reads bytes until a '\\0'; if the buffer is not null-terminated within its allocation this is UB. Need to know that the string is guaranteed null-terminated within its allocation when this branch is taken.\n\n- memcmp (from <string.h>)\n  - Used to compare up to FormatLen bytes of both strings. memcmp reads the full length given for both pointers; to avoid UB both String1 and String2 must have at least that many accessible bytes. Analysis requires memcmp semantics and verification that the chosen comparison length (min of FormatLen1, FormatLen2) is bounded by the actual buffer sizes.\n\n- memcpy (from <string.h>)\n  - Used to copy FormatLen bytes into local ScrubbedString1/2 (256-byte arrays), then a NUL is written at index FormatLen. To avoid overflow of the local buffers, FormatLen must be <= 255 (so the terminating NUL fits) and also must not exceed the accessible bytes of the source string. Determining whether that holds requires knowledge of how FormatLen is derived and any external bounds.\n\n- Contract: definition/guarantee of String1Max/String2Max relative to the actual allocated size of *String1/*String2 (caller precondition)\n  - The core MISRA concern is whether the sizes passed (String1Max/String2Max) and/or the null-termination assumptions can ever exceed the actual allocated object sizes. The code assumes either (a) StringXMax equals the buffer size (so memchr(..., StringXMax) is safe), or (b) UTASSERT_STRINGBUF_NULL_TERM indicates a valid null-terminated string (so strlen is safe). The precise API contract (caller preconditions) is required to prove no out-of-bounds access.\n\n- Any macro/constant limiting accepted string lengths (e.g., UTASSERT_STRINGBUF_MAX) if present\n  - If the codebase defines a maximum allowed input string length that is <= 255 (size of scratch buffers minus 1), that would prove memcpy cannot overflow the local scrubs. If such a macro exists its value is needed for the proof.\n\n- UtAssert_Compare_t enum (UtAssert_Compare_EQ, _NEQ, _LT, _GT, _LTEQ, _GTEQ)\n  - While not directly related to buffer bounds, the enum values drive control flow (which comparisons are tested) and thus can affect which branches execute. Include for completeness and to allow a full understanding of control flow affecting subsequent copying.\n\n- UtAssertEx prototype and UTASSERT_CASETYPE_FAILURE constant\n  - UtAssertEx is the function that is called with the scrubbed strings; its prototype (especially whether it is variadic and whether it can modify or expect particular formats) is useful to confirm that the function does not itself cause additional buffer accesses or constraints. The case-type macro is included as it is an argument to UtAssertEx and may influence how/when the return is used.\n\nIn summary, to determine whether any of the string.h calls (memchr, strlen, memcmp, memcpy) can read or write beyond object bounds you must know: (1) the precise semantics of those library calls (standard) and (2) the external guarantees about the input pointers and the values passed in String1Max/String2Max (the caller contract/macros). Also, to show the local 256-byte scrubbing cannot overflow you need any project-level length limits that bound FormatLen to <=255. These symbols/definitions are therefore required to prove compliance with the MISRA rule."
