  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-extension tokens or constructs such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, typeof, statement-expressions ({ ... }) used in GCC, nested functions, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- The typedef of int32 from int32_t and use of size_t are standard C/stdint types, not extensions.\n- The gethostname call is a POSIX library function, not a compiler language extension; library/API usage is outside the scope of MISRA Rule 1.2 which targets language/compiler extensions.\n- Macros OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS, pointer indexing, assignments, and comments are all standard C constructs.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
