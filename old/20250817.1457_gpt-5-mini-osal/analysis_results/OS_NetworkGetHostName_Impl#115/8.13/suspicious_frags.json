  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for Rule 8.13. The only pointer in this function is the parameter char *host_name, which is written to (passed to gethostname and explicitly modified via host_name[name_len - 1] = 0). Because the buffer is an output buffer and is intentionally modified, qualifying it as const would be incorrect. There are no other pointer variables or pointer uses in the function that could be made const. Therefore no code in this function needs further investigation for Rule 8.13."
