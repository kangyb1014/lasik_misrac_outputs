  "explanation": "1) gethostname(...) - The MISRA rule asks whether pointers could be const-qualified. To decide this for host_name we must know whether the called API modifies the buffer. The POSIX gethostname prototype takes a char * and writes into the buffer; this proves host_name is an output (modifiable) buffer and therefore cannot be declared const in this implementation.\n\n2) OS_NetworkGetHostName(...) (the caller/wrapper) - To determine whether the API chain could allow host_name to be const (or whether const qualifiers would be acceptable at the API boundary), the wrapper's declaration/signature and how it passes its argument to the Impl function must be known. If the wrapper accepts or propagates a const-qualified pointer, that could indicate a wider const-correctness problem; if it uses a non-const char *, that is consistent with the Impl writing to host_name."
