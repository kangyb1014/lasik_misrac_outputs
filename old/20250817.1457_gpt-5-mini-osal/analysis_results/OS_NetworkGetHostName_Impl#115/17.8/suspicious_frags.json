  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying the value of a function parameter (e.g. assigning to the pointer parameter itself) but allows modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter. In the provided function:\n\n- The function parameters are `char *host_name` and `size_t name_len`. Neither parameter is assigned to or otherwise modified as an object (no statements like `host_name = ...` or `name_len = ...`).\n- The call `gethostname(host_name, name_len)` may write into the buffer pointed to by `host_name`; that modifies the object referred to by the pointer, which is explicitly permitted by the rule.\n- The statement `host_name[name_len - 1] = 0;` writes into the buffer (the object pointed to), not to the pointer variable `host_name` itself; this is also allowed by the rule. It therefore does not violate Rule 17.8.\n\n(As an aside: potential runtime issues such as `name_len == 0` causing an out-of-bounds access are not relevant to Rule 17.8 and thus are not flagged here.)"
