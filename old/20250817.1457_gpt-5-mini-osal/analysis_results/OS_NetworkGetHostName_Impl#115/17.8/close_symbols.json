  "explanation": "- gethostname: Needed to know its prototype/behavior. The MISRA rule allows modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter but forbids modifying the pointer itself. gethostname takes a char * and may write into the buffer pointed to by host_name (allowed). Confirming its signature ensures the call does not modify the host_name pointer itself.\n- size_t: Required to confirm that name_len is a by-value integer type (not a pointer or alias) so that the function does not modify a parameter passed by reference. Also to reason about the expression host_name[name_len - 1].\n- int32: Needed to verify the function return type is not some pointer or alias that could affect interpretation of parameters (ensures return_code is a local scalar, not an alias to a parameter).\n- OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: Included so an analyzer can check whether these identifiers are simple constants/enums (no side effects) or macros/functions that could alter parameters. They appear in assignments only, but confirming they are non\u2011modifying constants removes the possibility that their use indirectly modifies a parameter.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether the code modifies the pointer parameter host_name itself (it does not \u2014 it writes through the pointer, which MISRA permits) and that no called symbol or macro unexpectedly modifies the parameter variable."
