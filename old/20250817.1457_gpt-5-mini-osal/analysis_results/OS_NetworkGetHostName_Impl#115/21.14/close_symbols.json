  "explanation": "OS_NetworkGetHostName \u2014 this is the caller/wrapper of the Impl function (per the call graph). The wrapper may perform further operations (including comparisons) on the host_name returned by the Impl; to determine whether memcmp is used to compare a null\u2011terminated string you must inspect the wrapper's code.\n\nmemcmp \u2014 the MISRA rule specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings. You must locate the memcmp symbol/usages to see whether it is called with string arguments (null\u2011terminated) or with explicit byte lengths (allowed for raw byte buffers).\n\ngethostname \u2014 POSIX gethostname does not guarantee null termination in all cases. Understanding gethostname behavior (and its possible return paths) is needed to determine whether the buffer passed on to any memcmp call is or might be a null\u2011terminated C string.\n\nOS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS \u2014 these return codes determine which path (success vs error) is taken in the Impl. The Impl only enforces null termination on the success path; callers may examine the buffer on either path. Knowing which return code is returned (and when) is necessary to reason about whether subsequent memcmp calls would be operating on null\u2011terminated strings.\n\nhost_name buffer allocation/definition in OS_NetworkGetHostName \u2014 the concrete allocation, size and initialization of the host_name buffer at the call site (in the caller) matter: if the caller allocates a buffer, initializes it, or treats it as a null\u2011terminated string before/after the call, that affects whether any memcmp usage there is comparing null\u2011terminated strings. Inspecting that allocation/usage site is required to conclude a MISRA violation."
