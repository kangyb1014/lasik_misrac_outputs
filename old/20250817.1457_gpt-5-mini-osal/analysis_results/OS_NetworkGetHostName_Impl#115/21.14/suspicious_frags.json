  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target and related code for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp or similar pattern of using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. No occurrences of memcmp are present in the target function OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl or in the supplied related code. The code calls gethostname and explicitly ensures termination by assigning host_name[name_len - 1] = 0; the wrapper sets host_name[0] = 0 on failure. No string-comparison standard library functions (memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, etc.) are used to compare null-terminated strings in the fragments provided, so there are no code fragments requiring investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
