  "explanation": "No statically unreachable code is present in the provided functions. Reasoning:\n\n- OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl: The if/else branches are both potentially reachable at run time (gethostname can succeed or fail). There is no code after the final return, no dead/duplicate assignments, and no unconditional jumps/loops that would make later statements unreachable.\n\n- Caller OS_NetworkGetHostName: The post-call check (if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS) { host_name[0] = 0; }) is reached when the implementation reports failure; the return at the end is the normal completion. No code in this snippet is syntactically or obviously unreachable.\n\nNotes for completeness (not flagged as suspicious fragments):\n- The safety of host_name[name_len - 1] = 0 depends on name_len being > 0. The caller invokes OS_CHECK_SIZE(name_len) before delegating; if that macro guarantees name_len >= 1 (as intended), the write is safe. If OS_CHECK_SIZE expands to an unconditional non-local exit (e.g. return or abort) that would be outside these functions, that would not create unreachable code inside the shown functions themselves. If OS_CHECK_* macros have unexpected behavior (e.g. infinite loops or unconditional returns inside the same function body as expanded), those macros should be reviewed, but their expansions are not present in the supplied code and therefore are not classified here as unreachable code fragments."
