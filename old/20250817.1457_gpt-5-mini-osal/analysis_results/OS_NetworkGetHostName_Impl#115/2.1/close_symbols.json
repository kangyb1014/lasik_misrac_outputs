  "explanation": "gethostname: The conditional in the target function depends entirely on the runtime return value of gethostname. To decide if either branch (the if or the else) is statically unreachable you must inspect the gethostname declaration/definition/contract (or any macro that replaces it) to know whether it can ever return <0 or >=0 in this build.\n\nOS_NetworkGetHostName: This caller may enforce preconditions (for example on name_len or host_name) or wrap/replace gethostname; its implementation must be inspected to see if it makes one of the branches in the Impl function impossible (e.g. by guaranteeing gethostname is never called, or by only calling Impl with particular inputs), which would create unreachable code inside the Impl.\n\nOS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS: These macros/enum constants are assigned in the two branches. Knowing their definitions is necessary to tell if the branches have any observable effect (e.g. if they are equal or resolve to the same value via macros, one assignment might be redundant/unreachable in effect), which can affect a static determination of unreachable or dead code."
