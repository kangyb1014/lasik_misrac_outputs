  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl(char *host_name, size_t name_len)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    if (gethostname(host_name, name_len) < 0)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * posix does not say that the name is always\n         * null terminated, so its worthwhile to ensure it\n         */\n        host_name[name_len - 1] = 0;\n        return_code             = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl:\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\nint32 OS_NetworkGetHostName(char *host_name, size_t name_len)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(host_name);\n    OS_CHECK_SIZE(name_len);\n\n    /* delegate to low-level API */\n    return_code = OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl(host_name, name_len);\n    if (return_code != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* return an empty string on failure, just in case */\n        host_name[0] = 0;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nhost_name[0] = 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment host_name[0] = 0 is executed only on the error path (return_code != OS_SUCCESS) to guarantee an empty, NUL-terminated string is returned to the caller. Removing it would change observable program behaviour (the caller might see leftover/garbage data in host_name), so the statement is not dead code. Note: this relies on OS_CHECK_SIZE(name_len) ensuring name_len > 0 to avoid out-of-bounds access."
