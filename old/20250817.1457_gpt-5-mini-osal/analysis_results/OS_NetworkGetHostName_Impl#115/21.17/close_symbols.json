  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why:\n\n1) gethostname (prototype and POSIX semantics)\n   - The function is called by the target. To verify no out\u2011of\u2011bounds writes we must know exactly what gethostname may write given the passed length (whether it guarantees a NUL, how many bytes it may copy, behavior when len==0 or len is too small, and its return conventions). POSIX semantics determine whether the code\u2019s post\u2011assignment (host_name[name_len - 1] = 0) is sufficient and whether gethostname itself can write beyond host_name[0..name_len-1].\n\n2) OS_NetworkGetHostName (caller/wrapper source)\n   - The immediate caller provides the host_name pointer and name_len value and may impose preconditions or perform validations. To determine whether host_name[name_len - 1] is a valid access (and whether name_len can be zero or host_name can be NULL), the wrapper source (signature and any checks) must be inspected.\n\n3) Call sites that supply host_name and name_len (buffer allocation/size provenance)\n   - If there are higher\u2011level callers that allocate the buffer or compute name_len, their behavior establishes the actual buffer length and whether name_len reflects the buffer capacity. This is required to ensure the code does not write beyond the caller\u2019s object bounds.\n\n4) size_t typedef/limits\n   - The code indexes host_name using name_len - 1; understanding size_t width and whether name_len can be zero or underflow when decremented is necessary to reason about potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds index computations.\n\n5) int32 typedef/limits\n   - For completeness of return semantics and to ensure comparisons/assignments conform to expected ranges/types (not directly about string bounds but required to fully understand the function\u2019s contract and error handling).\n\n6) OS_ERROR and OS_SUCCESS definitions\n   - Knowing what these macros/constants mean is necessary to interpret the control flow and return conditions (e.g., whether callers treat particular return codes specially), which can affect how callers pass buffers and lengths.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine (a) whether gethostname can itself overrun the provided buffer, (b) whether name_len can be zero or otherwise invalid, and (c) whether host_name actually points to a buffer of at least name_len bytes \u2014 all required to check for MISRA violations concerning accesses beyond object bounds."
