  "scenario": "The implementation does not call any of the <string.h> functions named in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.), so Rule 21.17 is not violated. Note: there is an unrelated potential out-of-bounds write if name_len == 0 because host_name[name_len - 1] = 0 will index before the buffer; this should be guarded (e.g., check name_len > 0) to avoid undefined behavior."
