  "scenario": "No violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 for this fragment. gethostname is not one of the <string.h> string-handling functions listed in Rule 21.17, so the rule does not directly apply to this call. A concrete violation scenario (not covered by 21.17 but still unsafe) would be if the caller passes a host_name object smaller than name_len (e.g. char buf[16]; name_len == 32), in which case gethostname could write beyond the bounds of host_name and cause an out-of-bounds access."
