  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe code writes to host_name[name_len - 1] without checking that name_len > 0 (or that host_name points to at least name_len bytes). If name_len == 0 this indexes host_name at size_t underflow (very large index) and causes an out-of-bounds write. Therefore the fragment can violate the bound-access requirement of Rule 21.17.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/927.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl(char *host_name, size_t name_len)\n{\n    int32 return_code;\n\n    if (gethostname(host_name, name_len) < 0)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * posix does not say that the name is always\n         * null terminated, so its worthwhile to ensure it\n         */\n        host_name[name_len - 1] = 0;\n        return_code             = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified OS_NetworkGetHostName_Impl code.\n",
