  "explanation": "Reason for each symbol:\n\n- fork: The function's control flow depends on fork() return values (negative -> error/return; 0 -> child branch; >0 -> parent branch). To decide whether any branch is unreachable you must know fork's possible return semantics and platform behaviour.\n\n- execlp: exec-family semantics determine reachability inside the child: on successful exec() the child image is replaced and execution does not continue \u2014 this makes any subsequent child statements unreachable. Static analysis needs execlp semantics (and whether it is treated as non-returning on success).\n\n- exit: exit() terminates the process. Knowing that exit does not return (or whether an analyzer recognizes it as non-returning) is required to mark code after it unreachable in the child branch.\n\n- waitpid: The parent path calls waitpid(); understanding its blocking/return behaviour is necessary to determine parent-path reachability and whether any code following waitpid is reachable in the parent.\n\n- EXIT_FAILURE: The constant passed to exit affects the call but, more importantly, its presence indicates a termination call; analysis tools may need its definition to resolve the exit call usage.\n\n- NULL: Used as the terminator in the execlp argument list; its definition may be required by the analyzer to resolve the call site signature and determine call semantics.\n\n- pid_t: The type and value domain of pid_t are needed to reason about the possible return values from fork (negative, zero, positive) and therefore which branches are reachable.\n\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl: This direct caller is required to determine whether OS_BSP_ExecTput is ever invoked in the project; if the caller (or its callers) are unreachable, then OS_BSP_ExecTput itself may be unreachable.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText: Shown in the static call graph as a caller of OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl; including higher-level callers is necessary to evaluate global reachability of OS_BSP_ExecTput across the project.\n\n(With these symbols an analyzer can determine both intra-function unreachable statements caused by exec/exit/fork semantics and inter-function reachability of the function itself via its callers.)"
