  "explanation": "- execlp prototype: required to know the parameter types that execlp expects (in particular the declared types of the fixed and variadic arguments). This is necessary to determine whether passing cap and param discards const-qualification or otherwise allows modification of the pointed-to objects: the MISRA check must know if the call could result in modification of the objects referred to by the pointer parameters or if a const->non-const conversion occurs.\n- fork prototype: included so the analyzer understands fork's return semantics and that fork does not take or modify the function parameters; confirms that cpid is returned by value and no parameter aliasing/modification occurs via fork.\n- exit prototype: included to show that exit is called in the child path and does not modify the function parameters.\n- waitpid prototype: included so the analyzer can see how waitpid is called and verify it does not modify cap/param or their pointer values.\n- pid_t typedef: the type of cpid (returned by fork and used by waitpid) is needed so the analyzer can correctly interpret those calls and the control flow; ensures no hidden modification of parameters via type mismatch.\n- EXIT_FAILURE macro: required to fully resolve the call to exit(EXIT_FAILURE) (symbolic meaning of the argument is not relevant to parameter modification but included for completeness of call resolution).\n- NULL macro: required because execlp is called with a NULL terminator in the variadic argument list; the exact NULL symbol/type can affect how the variadic call is type-checked.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether any called function or type conversion in OS_BSP_ExecTput can modify the pointer parameters (the pointer variables or the objects they point to) or discard const qualifiers in a way that would violate the MISRA rule."
