  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies either of the function parameters (cap or param). Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to cap or param, no pointer arithmetic, no increment/decrement, and no passing of their addresses (e.g., &cap or &param) that could allow the pointer variables themselves to be altered.\n- The parameters are declared as const char * so the function cannot legally modify the objects they point to through those pointers within this function.\n- The only use of the parameters is to pass them by value to execlp; passing a pointer by value does not modify the pointer parameter itself. Although execlp takes varargs for the argv strings, that is a call that copies the pointer values into the called function \u2014 it does not change the pointer variables in this function.\n- Other calls (fork, exit, waitpid) do not modify the function parameters.\nTherefore no fragment requires investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified)."
