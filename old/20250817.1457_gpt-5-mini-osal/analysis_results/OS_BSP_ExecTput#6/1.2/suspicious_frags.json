  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the snippet. The code only uses standard C language constructs (static function, pointer parameters, local variables) and POSIX library/API symbols (pid_t, fork, execlp, waitpid, exit, EXIT_FAILURE). POSIX functions/types are platform APIs, not compiler language extensions documented as GCC/Clang/MSVC extensions. There are no compiler-specific tokens or features present (for example no __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions, nested functions, or other vendor-specific extensions). Therefore no fragments require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
