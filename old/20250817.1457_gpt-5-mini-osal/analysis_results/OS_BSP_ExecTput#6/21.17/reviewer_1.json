  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_BSP_ExecTput code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_BSP_ExecTput.\n```c\nstatic void OS_BSP_ExecTput(const char *cap, const char *param)\n{\n    pid_t cpid;\n    int   status;\n\n    cpid = fork();\n    if (cpid < 0)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n    if (cpid == 0)\n    {\n        execlp(\"tput\", \"tput\", cap, param, NULL);\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    waitpid(cpid, &status, 0);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The code calls strlen(OutputMessage) without any check that OutputMessage is non-NULL and points to a NUL-terminated character array. If a caller passes NULL or a char buffer that is not NUL-terminated (or a pointer to a subobject near its end), strlen may read past the bounds of the object, violating Rule 21.17. For example, passing a fixed-size buffer filled exactly to capacity without a terminating '\\0', or passing NULL, will cause out-of-bounds access.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void write_log_entry(const char *stage, const char *cap, const char *param, pid_t pid, int status, int err)\n{\n    int fd = open(\"/tmp/logs/55.txt\", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND, 0644);\n    if (fd < 0)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    char buf[512];\n    /*\n     * We purposely avoid printing cap/param as strings (\"%s\") because\n     * that would dereference them and could itself cause out-of-bounds\n     * reads if they are not NUL-terminated or are NULL. Instead we log\n     * pointer values and boolean NULL checks to allow other agents to\n     * reproduce and reason about the scenario without introducing a new\n     * violation here.\n     */\n    time_t t = time(NULL);\n    int n = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf),\n                     \"[%ld] stage=%s pid=%d cap_ptr=%p cap_is_null=%d param_ptr=%p param_is_null=%d status=%d err=%d\\n\",\n                     (long)t,\n                     stage ? stage : \"(null)\",\n                     (int)pid,\n                     (const void *)cap,\n                     (cap == NULL) ? 1 : 0,\n                     (const void *)param,\n                     (param == NULL) ? 1 : 0,\n                     status,\n                     err);\n    if (n > 0)\n    {\n        if (n > (int)sizeof(buf)) n = (int)sizeof(buf);\n        (void)write(fd, buf, (size_t)n);\n    }\n\n    close(fd);\n}\n\nstatic void OS_BSP_ExecTput(const char *cap, const char *param)\n{\n    pid_t cpid;\n    int   status;\n\n    /* Log entry with pointer values and NULL checks before forking */\n    write_log_entry(\"before_fork\", cap, param, -1, 0, 0);\n\n    cpid = fork();\n    if (cpid < 0)\n    {\n        /* fork failed */\n        write_log_entry(\"fork_failed\", cap, param, -1, 0, errno);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (cpid == 0)\n    {\n        /* Child: log state before attempting to exec */\n        write_log_entry(\"child_before_execlp\", cap, param, getpid(), 0, 0);\n\n        execlp(\"tput\", \"tput\", cap, param, NULL);\n\n        /* If execlp returns, it failed.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically concerns the use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) and forbids uses that can read beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. The original OS_BSP_ExecTput implementation does not call any <string.h> functions \u2014 it only calls fork, execlp and waitpid. The agent\u2019s scenario cites strlen and out-of-bounds reads, but there is no strlen (or other string.h call) in the shown code, so Rule 21.17 is not violated by this function as written.\n\n(Separately, passing cap/param that are not valid NUL-terminated strings or invalid pointers can still cause runtime faults or undefined behaviour when execlp/execve attempts to use them, so it may be prudent to validate pointers before use. However, that is not a breach of MISRA Rule 21.17, which is limited to the standard string.h functions.)"
