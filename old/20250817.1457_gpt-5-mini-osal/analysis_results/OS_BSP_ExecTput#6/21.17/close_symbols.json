  "explanation": "- execlp: You must know the prototype/semantics (varargs, expects NUL-terminated char* arguments, whether it may read beyond callers' buffers). This determines whether passing cap/param can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds reads.\\n- fork, waitpid, exit, pid_t, EXIT_FAILURE, NULL: These control-flow / macro/type symbols affect process creation/termination and how arguments are passed to execlp (child process path). Understanding their semantics ensures the analysis focuses on string usage (they do not themselves perform string-handling but are needed to reason about which code path invokes execlp).\\n- OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl and UT_BSP_DoText: The callers (and grand\u2011caller) supply cap and param. To decide if any string-handling violation can occur you must inspect how those callers construct or obtain cap/param (ownership, lifetime, guaranteed NUL-termination, buffer sizes).\\n- <unistd.h>, <sys/types.h>, <sys/wait.h>, <stdlib.h>: Header declarations provide the exact function/type prototypes and macros (execlp, fork, pid_t, waitpid, exit, NULL, EXIT_FAILURE) required for sound static analysis.\\nCollectively these symbols let the next analyst (1) confirm whether execlp reads NUL-terminated strings only (thus whether cap/param must be terminated and sized), (2) trace the provenance and lifetimes of cap/param through the callers, and (3) rule out any direct use of <string.h> functions in this unit that could cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses."
