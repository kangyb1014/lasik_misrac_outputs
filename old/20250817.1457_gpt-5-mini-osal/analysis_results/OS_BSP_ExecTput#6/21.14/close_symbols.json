  "explanation": "OS_BSP_ConsoleSetMode_Impl \u2014 immediate caller of OS_BSP_ExecTput; must be inspected to see whether it (or code just before calling OS_BSP_ExecTput) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings or otherwise prepares/derives the cap/param strings in a way that would imply a memcmp-based comparison. UT_BSP_DoText \u2014 higher-level caller in the provided call chain; include to check for memcmp usage in the caller chain and to find origins of cap/param. fork, execlp, waitpid, exit \u2014 functions invoked directly by OS_BSP_ExecTput; include as close symbols so the analyzer can confirm that no hidden string comparisons (e.g., via wrappers or side-effects) occur in those calls or their platform-specific wrappers. memcmp \u2014 the exact standard-library symbol the MISRA rule forbids for comparing null-terminated strings; must be searched for in the target and its close-call/caller symbols. strcmp, strncmp \u2014 allowed string comparison functions; include to check whether code uses the correct alternatives (or incorrectly uses memcmp instead). bcmp \u2014 historical/alternate memory-compare API that can be used in place of memcmp on some platforms; include to detect equivalent forbidden usages."
