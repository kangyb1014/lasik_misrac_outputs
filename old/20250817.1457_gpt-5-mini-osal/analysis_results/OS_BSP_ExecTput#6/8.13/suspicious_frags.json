  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Reasons:\n- The function parameters that are pointers are already const-qualified (const char *cap, const char *param), satisfying the rule.\n- There are no pointer variables declared locally that could be made const.\n- The string literals (\"tput\") are passed directly to execlp; execlp's parameters are const-qualified in standard headers (const char *), so no non-const pointer is being used or created here.\n- The only non-const pointer usage is &status passed to waitpid, which must be a non-const int* because waitpid writes the status (so it cannot be const).\n- NULL is used as the variadic terminator for execlp; this does not introduce a non-const pointer variable.\nGiven the above, there are no code fragments that need further investigation for Rule 8.13 in the provided function."
