First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided code fragments (UtList_Add and UtList_Insert_Before). MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 applies specifically to the structure and contents of for loops (first/second/third clauses, loop counter, loop control flag, and side effects in condition/iteration expressions). The given code contains only function calls and direct pointer assignments; there are no loop counters, no for-loop second/third clauses to inspect, and no modifications to a loop counter in a loop body. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied snippets that need investigation for Rule 14.2. Note: functions called but not provided (UtList_GetHead, UtList_NewNode) could contain for loops; those functions would need to be inspected separately if their definitions are available."
