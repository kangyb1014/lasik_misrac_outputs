  "explanation": "To decide whether any lines in UtList_Add are unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) we must know both the local control-flow facts and whether the function (and its branches) can ever be executed from program entry. Specific reasons:\n\n- UtList_GetHead (implementation / prototype / attributes): The if-condition depends entirely on the value returned by this function. To prove the if-body is reachable (or provably unreachable) we need the implementation or a contract/attributes (e.g. always-NULL, noreturn, infinite loop) that determine whether a non-NULL return is possible.\n\n- UtList_NewNode (implementation / prototype / attributes): The body creates and uses NewNode; if this symbol is a macro, has side effects, or is annotated (noreturn, always-NULL, etc.), that can change reachability reasoning for NewNode->Tag and the subsequent call. The implementation is needed to see if the call can succeed and permit execution of the statements following it.\n\n- UtList_Insert_Before (implementation / prototype / attributes): This call completes the if-body; attributes (noreturn) or macro expansion could affect whether the code path is reachable or whether control returns. Knowing its behavior is required to reason about execution of the if-body as written.\n\n- UtListNode_t (type/struct definition): To check whether NewNode->Tag is a valid expression (field present) and whether any compile-time constant layout/bit-field semantics could make the access unreachable or ill-formed; also to understand whether NewNode's creation can be elided by inlining/macro tricks.\n\n- UtListHead_t (type/struct definition): To understand what UtList_GetHead operates on and whether the call can be optimized away / reduced to a constant result by static analysis of the head structure.\n\n- UtTest_AddCommon and its callers (UtTest_Add, UtTest_AddSetup, UtTest_AddTeardown, UtTest_AddSubTest) and UtTest_Run: The static call graph shows these call chains. To determine whether UtList_Add itself is reachable from program entry we must inspect the implementations/registration of these callers and whether they are ever invoked at runtime (e.g. via the test runner). If none of these callers is reachable from main/test runner, UtList_Add may be unreachable.\n\n- main or test-runner entry point (implementation): Reachability must be traced from program entry; the test framework entry point(s) and how test cases are registered/executed are required to determine whether the caller chain leading to UtList_Add is actually invoked.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock and UT_BSP_Unlock (prototype/implementation/attributes): Present in the caller UtTest_AddCommon; their attributes (e.g. noreturn, longjmp, signal) could affect control flow and hence reachability of subsequent calls to UtList_Add in that caller. Their implementations/attributes are needed for complete control-flow analysis.\n\n- Relevant compile-time configuration / preprocessor macros: Conditional compilation or test registration macros can make the function or its callers absent/disabled in a given build. To prove unreachability in the built project, the build-time macros that control inclusion/registration must be known.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions/implementations and any function attributes or compile-time guards) allows a conservative, sound determination whether the if-branch or the whole function is provably unreachable in the final build, which is required to assess MISRA's rule against unreachable code."
