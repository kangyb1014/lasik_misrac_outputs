  "explanation": "For a correct dead\u2011code (MISRA) analysis of UtList_Add you must know whether the conditional body can ever affect program behaviour and whether the function itself is reachable. Each listed symbol affects that determination:\n\n- UtList_GetHead (implementation): The if condition depends on its return. If this function always returns NULL (or always non-NULL) for all valid inputs, the guarded body may be dead (or the condition redundant). You need its code/semantics to know possible return values for given ListHead/Tag.\n\n- UtList_NewNode (implementation): The body\u2019s actions include creating a new node. You must know whether this function has side effects (allocation, global state changes) or can fail (return NULL) because that determines whether NewNode->Tag assignment and subsequent insert are meaningful or unreachable/ineffective.\n\n- UtList_Insert_Before (implementation): This call performs the insertion side effect that could change program behaviour. To decide if the body\u2019s removal would affect behaviour you must know what this routine does (mutates global structures, timing, callbacks, etc.).\n\n- UtListHead_t (type/structure definition): The meaning of the ListHead parameter (layout, valid values, embedded tags) can determine whether UtList_GetHead can ever find a head for a Tag; it may encode tag ranges or state that force always-NULL results.\n\n- UtListNode_t (type/structure definition): Needed to confirm the presence and semantics of the Tag field and any invariants about node contents that affect behaviour when NewNode is created and inserted.\n\n- Any global/static storage that holds list heads (e.g. list table or initializer used by UtList_GetHead): If UtList_GetHead consults global structures (tables, maps), their initialisation and allowed values determine whether TagHead can be non-NULL for any Tag \u2014 crucial for deciding if the guarded code is ever executed.\n\n- UtTest_AddCommon (caller implementation): If UtList_Add is never invoked in the program or only invoked under mutually exclusive/unused test code, then the body may be dead. You must inspect callers to establish reachability and typical arguments passed to UtList_Add.\n\n- UtTest_Add and other callers (UtTest_AddSetup, UtTest_AddTeardown, UtTest_AddSubTest): These higher-level callers show call sites and argument values (ListHead, Tag) used in practice; they help determine whether the conditional branch in UtList_Add is ever taken at runtime.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock / UT_BSP_Unlock (synchronization functions used by callers): Callers acquire locks around UtList_Add; these synchronization calls can be part of observable behaviour (timing, concurrency) so removal of the add/insert sequence could change system behaviour. Also they indicate whether UtList_Add is used in concurrent contexts which affects whether its side effects are relevant.\n\nProvide these symbols (implementations and type definitions) so the next analyst can determine whether the guarded body is ever executed or whether its removal would alter program behaviour (i.e., whether it is dead code)."
