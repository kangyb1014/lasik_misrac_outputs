Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I have not reported the function signature, the local variable declarations (\"UtListNode_t *TagHead;\" and \"UtListNode_t *NewNode;\"), or the opening/closing braces because they are not executed statements and therefore cannot be \"dead code\" per MISRA Rule 2.2. Likewise, simple syntactic elements (semicolon lines, braces) and the function return type are not actionable for dead-code analysis. The listed fragments are the executed operations whose removal might not change program behaviour in some contexts (e.g. if the helper functions already perform the same actions or if the condition is always true/false), so they should be investigated further."
