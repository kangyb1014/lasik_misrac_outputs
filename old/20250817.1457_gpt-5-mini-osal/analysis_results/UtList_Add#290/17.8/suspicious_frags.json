  "explanation": "No parameter is modified in this function. Analysis of each parameter:\n- ListHead (UtListHead_t *): only read and passed to UtList_GetHead; the pointer variable is not assigned or altered here. Modifying the object pointed-to by ListHead (inside called functions) would be allowed, but that is outside this fragment and not present here.\n- Data (void *): only passed to UtList_NewNode; the pointer itself is not assigned or changed in this function. Any modification to the object pointed to would occur in the called function (allowed by the rule).\n- DataSize (uint32) and Tag (uint32): scalar parameters are only read (used as arguments or RHS in assignments). There are no assignments to these parameter variables (e.g., Tag = ...), so they are not modified.\n- Local variables (TagHead, NewNode) are assigned and used, but they are not function parameters and thus not subject to Rule 17.8.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
