  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for checking \"Language extensions should not be used\":\n\n- UtListHead_t (type/struct definition)\n  - The target function manipulates a pointer to UtListHead_t. The struct/typedef body may use compiler extensions (anonymous unions/structs, __packed__, alignment attributes, implementation-specific bit-field widths, compiler-specific keywords) that would violate the MISRA rule. We must inspect the type definition to detect any such extensions.\n\n- UtListNode_t (type/struct definition)\n  - The code accesses NewNode->Tag and relies on the node layout. The node definition may include language extensions (attributes, nonstandard member declarations, anonymous members, bitfields relying on implementation behavior). Also the Tag member type and any extension in the struct must be checked.\n\n- uint32 (typedef / definition)\n  - The code uses the identifier uint32 for parameters and members. We must confirm how uint32 is defined (typedef to a standard uint32_t, use of compiler-specific integer widths, or a macro that expands to a compiler extension type like __int128). If defined via a nonstandard or compiler-specific construct, that would violate the rule.\n\n- UtList_GetHead (declaration and definition)\n  - The call site could be affected by the function prototype (e.g., use of compiler-specific attributes in the declaration such as __attribute__((...)), calling-convention specifiers, or inline semantics). The implementation might be inline, use nested functions, or other extensions that matter for the overall analysis.\n\n- UtList_NewNode (declaration and definition)\n  - NewNode is created via this function; its declaration or definition could use extensions (attributes, nonstandard return types, macros expanding to extensions, inline assembly, statement-expressions in macros used to implement it). Also the function might place extension-bearing members into the returned object.\n\n- UtList_Insert_Before (declaration and definition)\n  - The prototype/implementation may include compiler-specific attributes or language extensions (inline, calling-convention specifiers, macros that use statement expressions, etc.) which must be checked.\n\n- Headers/macros that define/annotate the above (e.g. any headers that introduce attributes/macros like __attribute__, __inline__, __packed__, __extension__, anonymous-union/struct macros)\n  - Many extensions are introduced by macros or header-level pragmas/attributes. To be sure the target function and the types/callees it uses do not rely on compiler extensions, we must inspect the headers and macros that define these types and functions (including any macro wrappers around declarations) for use of known compiler-specific extensions.\n\nIn sum, to determine whether UtList_Add (and the constructs it uses) violates the MISRA prohibition on language extensions, we must examine the concrete definitions/declarations of the used types and the prototypes/implementations of the three callees plus the header/macros that could inject compiler-specific extensions. Only those symbol definitions can reveal uses of __attribute__, __inline__/__asm, anonymous members, packed/align pragmas, statement-expressions, or other compiler-specific constructs."
