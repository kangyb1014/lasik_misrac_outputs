  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses only standard C constructs: function definition with explicit parameter list, pointer declarations, typedef-like identifiers (UtListHead_t, UtListNode_t, uint32) which are ordinary identifiers/typedefs (not compiler extensions), use of NULL, struct member access (->), and ordinary function calls. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extension constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, __declspec, nested functions, statement-expressions (GCC ({ ... })), typeof(), trailing-return-type (C++), anonymous structs/unions as extensions, or other documented compiler extensions. Therefore no fragments require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
