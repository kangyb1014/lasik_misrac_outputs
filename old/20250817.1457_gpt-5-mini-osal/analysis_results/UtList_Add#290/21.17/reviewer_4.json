  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following UtList_Add code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of UtList_Add.\n```c\nvoid UtList_Add(UtListHead_t *ListHead, void *Data, uint32 DataSize, uint32 Tag)\n{\n    UtListNode_t *TagHead;\n    UtListNode_t *NewNode;\n\n    TagHead = UtList_GetHead(ListHead, Tag);\n    if (TagHead != NULL)\n    {\n        NewNode      = UtList_NewNode(Data, DataSize);\n        NewNode->Tag = Tag;\n        UtList_Insert_Before(TagHead, NewNode);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:AllocNode->Node.Data = &AllocNode[1]; sets Data to a pointer one-past-the-end of the union object. Later memcpy(AllocNode->Node.Data, Data, DataSize) writes DataSize bytes starting at that address. Because the pointer is derived as a one-past-end pointer to the union object, the memcpy may access bytes beyond the bounds of the object referenced by that pointer (the union), which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Use (char *)AllocNode + sizeof(*AllocNode) or define a trailing flexible array member to obtain a pointer into the allocated region instead.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void UtList_Add_Log(const void *ListHead, const void *Data, uint32_t DataSize, uint32_t Tag,\n                           const void *TagHead, const void *NewNodeBefore, const void *NewNodeAfter)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/2327.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return; /* best-effort logging only */\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \"UtList_Add ENTER\\n\");\n    fprintf(f, \"  ListHead = %p\\n\", ListHead);\n    fprintf(f, \"  Data     = %p\\n\", Data);\n    fprintf(f, \"  DataSize = %u\\n\", (unsigned)DataSize);\n    fprintf(f, \"  Tag      = %u\\n\", (unsigned)Tag);\n    fprintf(f, \"  TagHead  = %p\\n\", TagHead);\n    fprintf(f, \"  NewNode before allocation = %p\\n\", NewNodeBefore);\n    fprintf(f, \"  NewNode after allocation  = %p\\n\", NewNodeAfter);\n    fprintf(f, \"UtList_Add LOG END\\n\\n\");\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nvoid UtList_Add(UtListHead_t *ListHead, void *Data, uint32 DataSize, uint32 Tag)\n{\n    UtListNode_t *TagHead;\n    UtListNode_t *NewNode = NULL;\n\n    /* Log entry state (no NewNode yet) */\n    UtList_Add_Log(ListHead, Data, DataSize, Tag, NULL, NULL, NULL);\n\n    TagHead = UtList_GetHead(ListHead, Tag);\n\n    /* Log found TagHead */\n    UtList_Add_Log(ListHead, Data, DataSize, Tag, TagHead, NULL, NULL);\n\n    if (TagHead != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Allocate new node (original logic preserved) */\n        NewNode = UtList_NewNode(Data, DataSize);\n\n        /* Prepare detailed logging about the newly allocated node.

  "explanation": "The provided runtime logs do not support agent A's claim. Agent A alleged AllocNode->Node.Data was set to a one\u2011past\u2011end pointer (&AllocNode[1]) and that a subsequent memcpy wrote DataSize bytes starting at that one\u2011past pointer, which would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The test output shows for each allocation: NewNode = 0x..., one_past_NewNode = NewNode + sizeof(*NewNode) (different address), and the value read from the start of the newly allocated node (used as a proxy for the stored Data pointer) equals NewNode (the start address), not the one\u2011past address. In other words, the stored pointer observed in the logs is the node start, not a one\u2011past\u2011end pointer. Also, the UtList_Add code shown does not itself call memcpy \u2014 the alleged out\u2011of\u2011bounds memcpy would have to occur in UtList_NewNode or a later caller; the supplied exhaustive tests produced no evidence of such an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access. Given the exhaustive test output, the scenario described by agent A is not demonstrated and the claimed Rule 21.17 violation is not supported by the provided data."
