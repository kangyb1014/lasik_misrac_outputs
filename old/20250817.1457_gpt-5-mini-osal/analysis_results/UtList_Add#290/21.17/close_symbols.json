  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n- UtList_NewNode: This is the most likely place where Data and DataSize are consumed (copied into a new node). You must inspect its implementation to see whether it uses memcpy/memmove/strcpy/etc., how it interprets DataSize, and whether it bounds the copy to the destination buffer.\n- UtListNode_t (type/struct definition): The node layout (fields for data buffer, stored size, pointer vs inline array) determines the valid destination size for any copy. You need the exact member sizes/offsets to determine if a copy can overflow.\n- UtList_Insert_Before: Although less likely to use string functions, its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not perform additional copies or mem* calls on node data that could violate bounds.\n- UtList_GetHead: Needed to confirm TagHead semantics and to ensure that how the returned node is used does not trigger additional copies. Also to rule out any string.h usage there (e.g., memcmp) that could be out-of-bounds.\n- UtListHead_t (type/struct definition): To understand what GetHead returns and any size/ownership contracts on node data stored in the list head structure.\n- Any allocation / size macros used by UtList_NewNode: Macros or constants that control the allocation size or maximum copy length in NewNode (e.g. static buffer sizes, maximum DataSize) are required to check whether the size passed or used in mem* calls is safe.\n- Implementations or call-sites of standard string.h functions used by the above: You must inspect the exact calls (which function, source/destination pointers, and length arguments) to determine whether the accesses stay within object bounds per the MISRA rule.\n- typedef/definition of uint32 (uint32_t): To know the width and range of DataSize/Tag parameters (affects reasoning about integer truncation/overflow when computing copy lengths or allocation sizes).\n\nProvide the implementations/definitions listed above to the next analyzer so it can determine whether any memcpy/memmove/strcpy/etc. calls can access beyond the bounds of their destination/source objects."
