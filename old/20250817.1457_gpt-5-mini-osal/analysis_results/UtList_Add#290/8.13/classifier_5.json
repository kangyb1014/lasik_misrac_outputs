  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "TagHead is assigned the mutable node pointer returned by UtList_GetHead and is subsequently used as a target for list modification (passed to UtList_Insert_Before). Because the node is intended to be modified/used in operations that alter the list, it should not be const-qualified. Therefore making the pointer to const would be inappropriate here, so Rule 8.13 is not violated."
