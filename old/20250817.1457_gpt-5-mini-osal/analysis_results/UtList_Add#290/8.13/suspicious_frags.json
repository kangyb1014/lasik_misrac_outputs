  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not involve pointers that could/should be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Specifically: the conditional 'if (TagHead != NULL)' only tests a pointer value (no qualification change applicable); the assignment 'NewNode->Tag = Tag' assigns to a non-pointer struct member (not relevant to pointer-to-const qualification); the function body braces and the non-pointer parameters 'uint32 DataSize' and 'uint32 Tag' and the 'void' return type are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. These elements therefore do not need further review under Rule 8.13."
