The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    /*\n     * NOTE: Mounting/Unmounting on POSIX is not implemented.\n     * For backward compatibility this call must return success.\n     *\n     * This is a no-op.

  "scenario": "No violation. OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl is an intentionally empty implementation that returns OS_SUCCESS for POSIX platforms and is invoked from OS_unmount. It is part of the API behavior (providing the required success return for backward compatibility). Although it performs no side effects, the return value and the presence of the function are required by the abstraction and removing or changing it could alter API semantics, so it is not considered dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
