  "explanation": "- OS_unmount: The only static caller of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl. You must inspect OS_unmount to see whether it actually invokes the Impl, whether it uses the Impl's return value, or whether removal of the Impl would change program behaviour (e.g. by changing control flow, error handling or timing).\n- OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease: Helpers used inside OS_unmount (per the call graph). They determine whether the filesystem-specific unmount implementation is selected or invoked. Their behaviour can affect whether the Impl is reachable/necessary and thus whether it is dead code.\n- OS_printf: Used by OS_unmount for diagnostics/logging. Logging/timing side-effects can make an otherwise empty function non-dead; inspect how OS_unmount uses logging around the call to the Impl.\n- OS_SUCCESS: The value returned by the Impl. You must know its semantic meaning across the codebase (and whether callers rely on that specific return) to decide if returning it unconditionally preserves behaviour when the Impl is removed.\n- OS_object_token_t: The Impl's parameter type. Understanding how tokens are produced/consumed by callers (OS_unmount and others) is necessary to determine whether the Impl must perform side-effects on the token or if it can be safely omitted.\n- file-system dispatch/registration table (function-pointer entry for unmount implementations): Many OS abstractions call implementations via registration tables or function-pointer structs rather than direct calls. You must check any dispatch/registration symbol that could reference OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl (or replace it at runtime) to determine whether removing the symbol would alter linkage/dispatch behaviour or cause runtime failures.\n\nCollecting and inspecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine if the implementation is truly unused (dead) or required for API/dispatch/return-value semantics or timing side-effects that would change program behaviour if removed."
