  "explanation": "The only code fragments that appear to be executed but perform no meaningful operation (i.e., removal would likely not change program behaviour) are the OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl implementation (explicitly documented as a no-op returning success) and the call/site in OS_unmount that invokes it and then unconditionally clears the mounted flags and releases the token. These should be investigated to confirm they are intentionally kept for ABI/backward-compatibility reasons and not accidental dead code.\n\nAll other fragments in the provided code perform observable actions or control flow that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2: \n- The parameter checks and name-search logic in OS_unmount (OS_CHECK_STRING, OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch, the flags/state checks) affect whether unmount proceeds.\n- The flag test and modification (filesys->flags & ... and filesys->flags &= ~(...)) change system state and are not no-ops.\n- OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch and its helpers manage transactions/locks and return codes; removing them would change behaviour.\n- OS_ObjectIdRelease completes the transaction and can have side effects.\n- OS_printf formats and writes to the console (or routes to debug), so its branches are active not dead.\n- Inline helper functions and macros shown (OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, etc.) are simple accessors or control constructs and are not obviously dead.\n\nTherefore only the two listed fragments warrant further investigation for compliance with the dead-code rule."
