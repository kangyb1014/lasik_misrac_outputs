  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The function uses standard C constructs only: a normal function definition, a return of a macro constant (OS_SUCCESS), comments, and references to types defined via typedef (int32 is a typedef of the standard int32_t, and OS_object_token_t is an incomplete struct typedef). There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, variable length arrays as extensions, anonymous structs/unions beyond standard C, language-specific keywords (e.g. __declspec), or other documented compiler extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that require further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
