  "explanation": "To decide if the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect any identifiers that can hide such extensions by macro/typedef/attribute expansion.  Specifically:\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: This is used directly in the return. It may be a macro (or function-like macro) that expands to an implementation that uses compiler extensions (e.g. GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __extension__, __builtin_... or inline asm). Inspecting its definition rules out hidden extensions.\n\n- int32: This is the function return type. It may be a typedef or macro that expands to a compiler-specific type or contain attributes (e.g. __attribute__, __declspec, or use of compiler-provided fixed-width types). Check its definition to ensure no extensions are used.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: This is the parameter type. Even though the parameter is unused in the body, the typedef/struct/union behind this name can include compiler extensions (anonymous unions/structs, packed/aligned attributes, transparent_union, __extension__ markers, etc.). Examine its declaration to ensure it does not rely on extensions.\n\nNo other symbols from the static call graph are needed because the function body is a single return; only the above definitions can conceal language extensions."
