  "explanation": "- OS_unmount: It is the caller of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl. To be sure the target function is not indirectly involved in any sequence that uses memcmp on NUL-terminated strings, the caller implementation must be inspected.  \n- OS_printf, OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease, UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These are the callees used by OS_unmount (per the static call graph). If any of these functions perform memcmp on NUL-terminated strings, that could indicate a violation in the call-path context of the target function. They must be checked so the analyzer can determine whether any memcmp-of-string usage is reachable from/related to the target.  \n- OS_SUCCESS: The target returns this macro/constant. Its definition should be checked to ensure it is not hiding any expression that uses memcmp (very unlikely but included for completeness).  \n- OS_object_token_t: The target takes a pointer to this type. Its definition may include string fields or helper macros/functions that could perform memcmp on strings; inspect to rule out hidden string comparisons.  \n- memcmp: The standard library function being restricted by the MISRA rule. The analyzer must search for uses of memcmp (and confirm the arguments are not NUL-terminated strings) in the target and in its close call-context (caller and that caller's callees listed above)."
