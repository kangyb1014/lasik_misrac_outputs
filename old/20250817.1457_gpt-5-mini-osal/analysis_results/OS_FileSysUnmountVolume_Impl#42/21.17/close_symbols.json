  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. The target function is a no-op: it does not reference or call any string.h functions or perform any memory/string operations (the function body simply returns the constant OS_SUCCESS). The static call graph shows the function has no callees, and the sole parameter (const OS_object_token_t *token) is unused. Therefore there are no pointer parameters used with string functions in this function to check for out-of-bounds accesses. (If you want to be extra cautious, you could inspect the definitions of OS_SUCCESS and OS_object_token_t to ensure they do not expand to or invoke code that uses string.h functions, but this is not necessary based on the provided source.)"
