  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl is unreachable (violates the MISRA rule banning unreachable code) the analyzer must trace callers and any indirect invocation/registration paths and confirm that the function can actually be invoked at run time. The following symbols are required for that analysis:\n\n- OS_unmount: The direct caller of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl (per the static call graph). If OS_unmount itself is never invoked (or never reachable), then OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl would be unreachable. The analyzer must inspect OS_unmount to see if it is reachable from any public API, startup code, or other call sites.\n\n- OS_printf, OS_ObjectIdGetBySearch, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease: These are direct callees within OS_unmount. Examining them can help determine whether OS_unmount contains runtime behavior, registration, or side effects that make it reachable (for example, if OS_unmount is referenced/registered via code paths that involve these functions). They also help understand whether OS_unmount is trimmed by the linker or conditionally compiled.\n\n- UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType, UT_Stub_RegisterContextWithMetaData, UT_ExecuteBasicHandler, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr: These unit\u2011test stubs are invoked by OS_unmount per the static graph. Their presence may indicate test-harness registrations or indirect invocation paths that could cause OS_unmount (and thus OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl) to be reachable during test builds. The analyzer must inspect test-harness code and registration mechanisms to decide reachability in relevant build configurations.\n\n- OS_object_token_t: The parameter type of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl. While the parameter is unused in this implementation, its definition and usage elsewhere could reveal indirect references (e.g., function pointer tables or registration APIs) that would make the function reachable.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: The return value used by the function. Including its definition verifies that the function body is a simple unconditional return and there are no hidden side effects or macros that could alter control flow and affect reachability.\n\nIn short: start by analyzing OS_unmount (its callers/registration paths) and the listed symbols called or involved with OS_unmount and the target function to establish whether the target function can be reached in any build/runtime configuration. If OS_unmount (and any registration/use sites) are unreachable, then OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl is unreachable; otherwise it is reachable and not a violation."
