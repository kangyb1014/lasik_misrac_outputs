  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The function OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl takes a parameter declared as const OS_object_token_t *token but does not reference or modify token in the function body; there are no assignments to the parameter, no pointer arithmetic, and no operations that could alter the parameter itself. The surrounding symbol definitions (typedefs and the OS_SUCCESS macro) do not modify function parameters and are irrelevant to Rule 17.8. Because the pointer parameter is not modified, and only the pointed-to object might legally be modified by a non-const pointer (not applicable here), there is no indication of a Rule 17.8 violation in the provided code."
