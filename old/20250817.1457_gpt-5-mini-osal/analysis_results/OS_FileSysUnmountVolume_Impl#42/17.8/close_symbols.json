  "explanation": "OS_object_token_t \u2014 The typedef/struct definition is required to understand the declared parameter type. In particular the analyzer must confirm whether the declaration is indeed a pointer type (and whether additional qualifiers are present via typedef) so it can decide whether assignments to the parameter variable would constitute pointer modification or modification of the pointee.\n\nint32 \u2014 The integer typedef used as the function return type is needed so the analyzer can fully parse the function prototype and ensure no hidden macro/typedef interaction changes parameter semantics.\n\nOS_SUCCESS \u2014 This macro/constant is used in the return statement. The analyzer must see its definition/expansion to ensure it is not a function-like macro or expression that could contain side-effects (for example code that references or modifies the parameter token)."
