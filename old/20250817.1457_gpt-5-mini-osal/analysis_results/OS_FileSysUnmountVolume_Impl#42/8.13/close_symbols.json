  "explanation": "1) OS_object_token_t (typedef): The parameter is declared as const OS_object_token_t *token. Whether this actually makes the function take a pointer-to-const-object (the MISRA-preferred form) depends on how OS_object_token_t is typedef'd. If OS_object_token_t is itself a pointer typedef (e.g. typedef struct X *OS_object_token_t;) then const OS_object_token_t *token does NOT yield a pointer-to-const-X \u2014 it yields a pointer-to-const-(pointer-to-X). The typedef is required to determine which entity is being const-qualified.\n\n2) struct (or underlying) definition for OS_object_token_t (e.g., struct OS_object_token): If OS_object_token_t is an alias for a struct type (or a pointer to such), you must see the underlying type to decide whether the pointee can/should be const-qualified (i.e., whether const should apply to the struct contents). This also lets you determine if any members require mutation (which would preclude adding const), and how const propagates through typedefs.\n\n3) OS_unmount (prototype and implementation / call site that invokes OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl): The caller's signature and the actual call expression are needed to check whether the caller passes a non-const object, takes the address of a non-const pointer, or performs casts that discard const. This shows whether const qualification in the callee is compatible with existing call sites or if it would force a cast/violate const-correctness elsewhere."
