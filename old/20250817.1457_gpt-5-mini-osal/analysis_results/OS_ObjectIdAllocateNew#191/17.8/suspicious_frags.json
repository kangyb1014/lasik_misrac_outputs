  "explanation": "No function parameter is assigned or otherwise modified in this function. Checks performed:\n- There are no statements that reassign any parameter variable (no occurrences of \"token =\", \"name =\", or \"idtype =\").\n- The pointer parameter token is only passed to other functions and dereferenced (e.g. token->obj_id), which is allowed: the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified under Rule 17.8, but the pointer itself must not be modified.\n- The only unusual operation is the cast (void *)name when calling OS_ObjectIdFindNextMatch; this does not modify the parameter variable name itself (it only converts its type for the call). If that call modifies the pointed-to object, that is permitted by Rule 17.8.\n- All other uses of parameters are reads or passing them to functions (which receive copies of the pointer), so there is no violation of Rule 17.8 in the provided code.\nTherefore there are no code fragments needing investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
