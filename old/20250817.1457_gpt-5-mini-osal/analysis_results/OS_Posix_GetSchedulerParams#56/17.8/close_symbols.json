  "explanation": "POSIX_PriorityLimits_t: Needed to verify that PriLim is a pointer to a structure with members PriorityMax/PriorityMin so that writing PriLim->PriorityMax/PriorityMin constitutes modification of the pointed-to object (allowed) and not modification of the pointer parameter itself (disallowed).\n\nsched_get_priority_max: Required to confirm its prototype/signature (it takes an int by value) and that it cannot modify the function's parameters (in particular sched_policy or PriLim). Also to ensure it does not use macros or side-effects that could alter parameters.\n\nsched_get_priority_min: Same reason as sched_get_priority_max (verify signature and absence of side-effects that could modify parameters).\n\nOS_DEBUG: This is a macro or function used with sched_policy and expressions involving PriLim. Its definition must be checked to ensure it does not expand to code that assigns to or otherwise modifies the parameter variables (sched_policy or PriLim) \u2014 e.g., a macro could contain unexpected side effects.\n\nstrerror: Included to confirm its prototype and that its use in the debug call does not modify any of the target function's parameters.\n\neno: The global errno symbol (listed as errno) is referenced in the calls to strerror; include it to verify there are no interactions where errno usage/modification could affect whether function parameters are being modified. Note: errno itself is unrelated to modifying the parameters, but its presence in calls warrants checking surrounding macros/implementations for side effects."
