  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The function parameters are: int sched_policy and POSIX_PriorityLimits_t *PriLim. The code does not modify either parameter variable itself (no assignments like sched_policy = ... or PriLim = ... nor pointer arithmetic on PriLim). The code only writes to the object pointed to by PriLim (PriLim->PriorityMax and PriLim->PriorityMin), which is explicitly allowed by the rule. Other uses of the parameters are read-only (sched_policy passed to sched_get_priority_max/min, casts of the pointed-to members for debugging). Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing further needs investigation for this rule."
