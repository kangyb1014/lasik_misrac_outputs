  "explanation": "For determining unreachable code in OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- sched_get_priority_max: The function's possible return values and error semantics (prototype and documented return range, e.g. -1 on error) determine whether the 'if (ret < 0)' branch is reachable. Static analysis requires its contract.\n\n- sched_get_priority_min: Same as above for the minimum-priority check; its return domain decides reachability of the corresponding error branch.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t: Definition of this type and the types/width/signedness of PriorityMax and PriorityMin. If these fields are unsigned or have a narrower/wider range, the subtraction (PriorityMax - PriorityMin) semantics (including underflow/wrap) affect whether the '< 4' check can ever be true.\n\n- OS_DEBUG: Definition or macro expansion. If OS_DEBUG compiles away to nothing (or to something with side-effects), the presence of the debug-call statements may or may not generate code; knowing its definition is needed to decide if those statements are actually reachable statements in the compiled program.\n\n- strerror: Prototype and behavior are needed to know whether the call is a side-effecting/observable operation. Also useful to determine whether the string-format branches are meaningful for reachability analysis.\n\n- errno: Declaration/semantics: errno is read inside the debug calls; knowledge of whether errno can change or is meaningful for the sched_* calls helps reason about the error branches and whether they are reachable.\n\n- OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init: The immediate caller in the static call graph. To decide if OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams itself is reachable in the complete program, the call chain into this function must be examined; include the caller(s) to determine top-level reachability.\n\n- OS_API_Impl_Init: Higher-level caller of OS_Posix_TaskAPI_Impl_Init (given in the static call graph). Including this symbol allows whole-program reachability analysis to decide whether the target function (and thus any branches in it) can be reached at all.\n\nIncluding these symbols (prototypes, type definitions and macro expansions) lets an analyzer determine whether the error branches and the final conditional are actually reachable, and whether the debug statements produce compiled code \u2014 all necessary to assess violations of the MISRA rule prohibiting unreachable code."
