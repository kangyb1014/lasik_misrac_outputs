  "explanation": "- OS_DEBUG: This logging macro/function is called repeatedly from the target. Its implementation may call formatting routines or helper functions that could use memcmp to compare strings; it must be inspected to ensure it does not compare null-terminated strings with memcmp.\n- strerror: The target calls strerror(errno) to obtain error text. Some implementations/wrappers could internally use memcmp; inspect strerror implementation used in the build to ensure it does not violate the rule.\n- errno: The global error indicator is passed to strerror; include it to locate usages and any wrappers that might process error strings with memcmp.\n- sched_get_priority_max: Called directly by the target. Although typically a kernel/libc call, any platform-specific wrapper in the codebase should be checked for memcmp usage on null-terminated strings.\n- sched_get_priority_min: Same rationale as sched_get_priority_max \u2014 check any local wrappers/implementations for forbidden memcmp usage.\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t: The struct/type of PriLim is used by the function; include its definition to confirm there are no hidden helper routines or custom accessors that perform string comparisons using memcmp.\n- vsnprintf: Common formatting helper possibly used by OS_DEBUG. If OS_DEBUG uses printf-style formatting, vsnprintf (or similar) implementations/wrappers must be checked for memcmp-on-C-strings.\n- vfprintf: Same as vsnprintf \u2014 include common output routines that OS_DEBUG might call so their implementations/wrappers can be inspected.\n- memcmp: Include the symbol itself so analysis can detect direct or indirect uses (in the target or in any callee/utility) and then verify whether it is applied to null-terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
