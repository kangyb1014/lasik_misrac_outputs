The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To check MISRA rule \u201cA for loop shall be well\u2011formed\u201d for this function we must also inspect any called functions/macros (because the behaviour of a for loop body includes called functions). Although OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams contains no for loops itself, the following symbols are required so the analyser can determine whether any for loops exist in invoked code or macros and whether those loops would violate the three\u2011clause/one\u2011counter constraints:\n\n- sched_get_priority_max\n  - This POSIX function is called directly. Its implementation could contain for loops; we must inspect its definition to ensure any such for loops are well\u2011formed and that they do not modify objects that would break MISRA constraints relative to this function.\n\n- sched_get_priority_min\n  - Same rationale as sched_get_priority_max: it is called here and its implementation must be checked for for\u2011loops and side effects that could affect compliance.\n\n- OS_DEBUG\n  - This is a logging macro/function used multiple times. Macros often expand into multiple statements or calls (possibly containing for loops). The analyser needs the OS_DEBUG definition/expansion to check for any for loops and ensure they meet the MISRA requirements (single loop counter, no unintended side effects, etc.).\n\n- strerror\n  - Called to format error text. Although usually a libc function, its source (or any wrapper used in this project) must be examined if available because it might contain for loops; also to confirm it has no side effects that interact with loop counters/objects in this translation unit.\n\n- errno\n  - errno is used as an argument to strerror. It is a global object; if any for loops in called functions read/modify errno or other globals, that could affect MISRA analysis (rule forbids using objects in loop clauses that are modified in the loop body). Knowing whether errno is a simple macro or an object is necessary for a complete analysis.\n\n- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t\n  - The struct type of PriLim is modified in this function. If any called function (or macro) contains for loops that use or modify members of this structure, that could violate the rule (clauses must not use objects that are modified in the loop body). The concrete definition is required to confirm which objects are involved.\n\n- stdbool.h symbols (bool, true, false)\n  - The function uses boolean return values. While unlikely to contain for loops, knowing the exact definition ensures correct interpretation of boolean expressions and any potential macros that could expand into constructs containing loops.\n\nNotes:\n- No for loops exist directly in OS_Posix_GetSchedulerParams, so primary concern is for loops inside called symbols (above). The analyser should obtain the source/definition for each listed symbol (or its project wrapper) and inspect them for any for statements and whether those statements satisfy the three\u2011clause and single\u2011counter constraints per MISRA."
