  "explanation": "Rule 21.17 targets use of string-handling functions from <string.h> that accept pointer parameters to objects (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) where misuse can lead to out-of-bounds accesses. The provided function does not call any of those functions. The only string-related call is strerror(errno), which returns a pointer to an internal, null-terminated error string and does not take a caller-supplied buffer to be written into, so it does not present the out-of-bounds risk covered by Rule 21.17. The OS_DEBUG invocations are logging/format calls; their implementation is not shown, but the code fragment itself does not call any of the <string.h> functions listed by the rule. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments in this function that need to be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
