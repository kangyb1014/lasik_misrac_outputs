  "explanation": "strerror \u2014 This is the only direct call from <string.h> in the function. To assess MISRA\u2019s string-bounds rule we must know the exact prototype/behavior used in the build (thread-safe vs. static-buffer variant) and whether its returned pointer could be mishandled. errno \u2014 The value passed into strerror; verify that it is a valid errno value in the target environment and that passing it to strerror cannot cause undefined behaviour in the implementation. OS_DEBUG (macro/function) \u2014 The function\u2019s output is produced via OS_DEBUG(\"...%s...\", strerror(errno)). You must inspect the OS_DEBUG definition to determine how it formats/consumes the %s argument and whether it internally uses any string-handling functions (snprintf/strcpy/strcat/etc.) that could cause out-of-bounds accesses when given the pointer returned by strerror. POSIX_PriorityLimits_t (type definition) \u2014 Needed to confirm member types (PriorityMin/PriorityMax) and casts used with printf (%d). A mismatched printf format can produce undefined behaviour that could interact with string handling/format routines. sched_get_priority_max / sched_get_priority_min \u2014 Prototypes and documented return semantics are needed to ensure the code paths are correct (error handling) and do not trigger any unexpected behavior that would change what is passed to strerror/OS_DEBUG. declarations/headers: <string.h>, <errno.h>, <sched.h>, <stdio.h> \u2014 Provide the standard prototypes and macros (including strerror and errno) so the exact function signatures and behaviours are known for static analysis. implementation/details of OS_DEBUG's formatting backend (e.g., printf/vsnprintf/snprintf or any strcpy/strcat it calls) \u2014 If OS_DEBUG forwards to a formatting routine or performs additional string manipulation, those routines must be inspected for use of string.h functions (memcpy/strcpy/strcat/strlen/etc.) and for correct buffer-size handling to determine any possible out-of-bounds string accesses. These symbols collectively let an analyst determine whether any string.h function is used in a way that could access beyond object bounds (directly via strerror or indirectly via OS_DEBUG\u2019s internals) and whether format/typing mismatches could lead to undefined behaviour."
