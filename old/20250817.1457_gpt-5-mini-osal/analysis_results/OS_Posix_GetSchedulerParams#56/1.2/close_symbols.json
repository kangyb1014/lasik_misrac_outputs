  "explanation": "- POSIX_PriorityLimits_t: The typedef/struct definition must be inspected to ensure it does not use compiler-specific extensions (packed attributes, nonstandard bit-fields, __extension__ annotations, GCC __attribute__ declarations, etc.). Its member types also matter for determining whether any extension syntax is present.\n- OS_DEBUG: Usually a macro or function; its definition must be checked because logging macros often use variadic macros, token-pasting tricks (##__VA_ARGS__), statement-expressions, or other compiler extensions. Determining whether OS_DEBUG uses any nonstandard extension is essential.\n- sched_get_priority_max: The prototype is normally from <sched.h>. Verify the included declaration in the build environment to ensure it is the standard POSIX prototype and not a compiler-specific replacement or macro that uses extensions.\n- sched_get_priority_min: Same rationale as sched_get_priority_max \u2014 confirm the actual declaration/definition in the environment for any extension usage.\n- strerror: Provided by the C library; inspect its declaration/include to ensure no extension macros or nonstandard overloads are used.\n- errno: errno is often a macro that may expand to thread-local or function-like constructs provided by the C library or compiler. Its definition should be checked to ensure it does not rely on compiler-specific extensions.\n- stdbool.h (bool/true/false): The code uses bool/true/false; confirm these come from the standard header (or _Bool) and are not compiler extensions (some toolchains provide a nonstandard bool). Checking this header/definition ensures use of a standard language feature rather than an extension.\n\nCollecting the above symbol definitions (their headers/macros/typedefs) lets an analyzer determine whether any compiler- or platform-specific language extensions are used by the target function."
