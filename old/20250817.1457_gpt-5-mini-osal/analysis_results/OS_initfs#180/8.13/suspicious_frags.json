  "explanation": "The rule targets pointers that should be const-qualified when possible. The only non-const pointer parameters and assignments in the provided code that could plausibly be reviewed for const-qualification are the 'address' parameter (in both OS_initfs and OS_FileSys_Initialize), its use when calling OS_FileSys_Initialize, and the assignment into filesys->address. Other pointer uses in the snippets need not be investigated for this rule: devname / volname / fsdevname / fsvolname are already const-qualified; strncpy has a non-const destination (filesys->volume_name) which must be mutable; token is passed by address to functions that allocate/modify object state (so it must be non-const); calls to OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew, OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl, OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl operate on/modify internal records and tokens and therefore require non-const pointer semantics. Macros and calls that read from const-qualified strings (e.g., strncmp, OS_CHECK_STRING) are using const correctly. Therefore only the listed fragments warrant investigation for possible missing const qualification."
