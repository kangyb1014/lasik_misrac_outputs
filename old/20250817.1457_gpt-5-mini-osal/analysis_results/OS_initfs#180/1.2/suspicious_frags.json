  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. The code uses standard C constructs: function definition, standard comment form, standard types/identifiers (size_t), and identifiers that appear to be typedefs (int32, osal_blockcount_t) or macros (false) which are not language extensions themselves. There are no tokens or constructs that are known compiler extensions (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, typeof, _Pragma, compiler-specific keywords or builtins). Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
