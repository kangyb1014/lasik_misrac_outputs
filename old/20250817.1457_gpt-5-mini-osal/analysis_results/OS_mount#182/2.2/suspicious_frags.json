  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not appear to be dead and therefore do not require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2:\n\n- The initial OS_CHECK_STRING(...) macro invocations are compile-time/parameter validation constructs (sizeof of a member) and/or perform pointer/length checks; they affect parameter checking and must remain.\n- The call to OS_ObjectIdGetByName(...) sets return_code and is used immediately to control entry to the subsequent block; it is not dead.\n- The assignment filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...) is used to access the filesystem record and is required for subsequent operations.\n- The call OS_FileSysMountVolume_Impl(&token) has observable side-effects and returns values that affect behavior (creation of system mount point, error returns when mount is not implemented) and so is not dead.\n- The updates to filesys->flags and the strncpy to filesys->virtual_mountpt have side effects on the in-memory table and are meaningful when a mount succeeds.\n- The OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token) call is a necessary transaction/lock release and is not dead.\n- Return values like OS_SUCCESS and the various #defined error codes are used as control-flow signals; their use in conditionals or returns means those constants and their comparisons are not dead.\n\nThe fragments reported are those that warrant investigation because they appear to produce assignments/operations whose effects may be overwritten or masked by later code, which could indicate executed operations that do not affect final program behaviour (i.e. potential dead code under Rule 2.2)."
