  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided code fragments. Therefore there are no direct uses of the standard string-handling functions that could cause accesses beyond the bounds of objects referenced by their pointer parameters, and Rule 21.17 is not directly applicable to these fragments.\n\nReasons the shown fragments need not be investigated for Rule 21.17:\n- OS_Console_CopyOut: performs a manual byte-by-byte copy using a pointer (pmsg) with an explicit null-terminator check (*pmsg == 0). The destination index WriteOffset is always constrained by console->BufSize (wraps when >= BufSize) and the code checks for buffer-full condition (WriteOffset == ReadPos) to stop. No standard library string functions are used.\n- OS_ConsoleWrite: calls OS_Console_CopyOut and otherwise manipulates positions and tokens; it does not call any <string.h> functions.\n- OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl: calls OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl with an explicit length (WriteSize) derived from buffer indices; this transmits a byte range and does not invoke any string.h functions.\n- OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl: only posts a semaphore; no string handling.\n\nNote: Although Rule 21.17 targets use of standard <string.h> functions and none are present, there is a separate potential issue (outside the scope of Rule 21.17) where OS_Console_CopyOut assumes the input Str is null-terminated; if callers supply a non-terminated buffer with no length information that could lead to out-of-bounds reads. That concern is not a violation of Rule 21.17 (which concerns standard library string functions) but may warrant additional defensive checks or documented preconditions."
