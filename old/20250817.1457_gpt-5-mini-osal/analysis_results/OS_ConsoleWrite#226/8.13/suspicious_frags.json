  "explanation": "All other lines either do not involve pointers or already use a const-qualified pointer where present (e.g. the function parameter const char *Str) or perform intentional modifications where a non-const pointer is appropriate. For example, PendingWritePos is passed by address to be updated by the callee, and console fields (WritePos, OverflowEvents, IsAsync, device_name checks) are explicitly read or modified within this function \u2014 these uses indicate the pointed-to data is intentionally mutable. The fragments listed are the locations in the function where pointer types are obtained, passed, or stored and therefore are the places that should be investigated for possible application of MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 (i.e. whether the pointers could or should point to const-qualified types). No other code fragments in this function present additional pointer targets that would need investigation under Rule 8.13."
