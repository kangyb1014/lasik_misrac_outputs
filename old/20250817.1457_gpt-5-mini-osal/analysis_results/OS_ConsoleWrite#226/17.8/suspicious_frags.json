  "explanation": "No function parameter of OS_ConsoleWrite is modified in this function. The parameters are:\n- console_id (passed by value) \u2014 used as an argument but never assigned to or incremented.\n- Str (const char *) \u2014 passed to OS_Console_CopyOut but not assigned or otherwise altered in this function. The pointer variable Str itself is not modified; only the object pointed-to could be modified by callees (and it is declared const here, preventing modification).\nOther potentially-looking lines were inspected and do not violate Rule 17.8:\n- Calls to OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_Console_CopyOut, OS_ConsoleWakeup_Impl, OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl, and OS_ObjectIdRelease pass parameters but do not modify this function's parameters.\n- Modifications such as PendingWritePos = console->WritePos, console->WritePos = PendingWritePos, and ++console->OverflowEvents affect local variables or fields of objects reached via local pointers (console) and not the function parameters. Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule; however, no such modification to *Str occurs here.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
