  "explanation": "Other pointer-related fragments in the function are not suspicious for Rule 8.13: the parameters 'int32 *Retcode' and 'int32 *Count' are output parameters that are written to, so they must not be const-qualified. The function parameter 'UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey' is passed by value (not a pointer). There are no other pointer variables in the shown code. The only pointer that is only read (and thus could reasonably be const-qualified) is StubPtr, which is why the declaration, its assignment, and its dereferences are reported above."
