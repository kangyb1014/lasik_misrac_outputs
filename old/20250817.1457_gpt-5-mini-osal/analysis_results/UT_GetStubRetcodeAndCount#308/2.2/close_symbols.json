  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for dead-code analysis of UT_GetStubRetcodeAndCount:\n\n- UT_GetStubEntry\n  - The target function's only call is to UT_GetStubEntry. To decide if the call (and therefore the surrounding conditional and subsequent assignments) is dead, we must know whether UT_GetStubEntry has observable side effects (modifies global state, I/O, timing, or volatile objects). If it has side effects, the call cannot be removed even if its return value is unused. If it is side-effect-free, removal of the call might be candidate dead code. The implementation is therefore required.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t\n  - The function dereferences the returned pointer to access members (Data.Rc.Count and Data.Rc.Value). Knowing the full struct definition (including any qualifiers such as volatile, or accessor semantics) is necessary to determine whether these reads or writes have observable effects or alias with other objects. For example, volatile members or accessor macros could make these accesses observable and thus not dead.\n\n- UT_EntryKey_t\n  - The key type may influence how UT_GetStubEntry behaves (e.g., key encoding or side-effectful translation). Understanding its representation can be necessary to reason about UT_GetStubEntry's side effects or whether particular keys trigger actions.\n\n- UT_ENTRYTYPE_COUNTER\n  - The constant/enum argument passed to UT_GetStubEntry may select behavior inside UT_GetStubEntry (lookup type, side-effectful counters, registration). Its value/semantics are required to determine whether the call performed here is no-op or performs observable work.\n\n- UT_StubTable\n  - If UT_GetStubEntry reads/modifies a global stub table or registry, that global object and its semantics must be known to determine whether calling UT_GetStubEntry or reading the returned entry produces observable effects (e.g., updating last-accessed timestamps, counters) that would prevent the operations from being considered dead.\n\n- UT_StubTableEntry_t::Data.Rc.Count and UT_StubTableEntry_t::Data.Rc.Value\n  - The exact types and qualifiers of these members (volatile, atomic, or implemented via accessor macros) determine whether reading them and storing into *Count and *Retcode are observable. If the members are volatile or mapped to memory-mapped registers, the reads are not dead. If they are simple plain data with no aliasing, the assignments may be removable if their results are never observed elsewhere.\n\n- int32 and bool typedefs\n  - Semantic types (e.g., if int32 is an alias to a volatile-qualified type or if bool maps to a specialized type) can affect whether assignments to the pointed-to objects are observable. Confirming their definitions rules out type-level observable behavior.\n\n- Callers_of_UT_GetStubRetcodeAndCount\n  - Determining whether the stores to *Count and *Retcode affect program behaviour requires knowing how the callers use (or ignore) the output values. If every caller discards the outputs or if the function is never called, the assignments might be dead. Conversely, if callers use the outputs or rely on the boolean return value, the code is live. Therefore the set of call sites (including indirect calls via function pointers) must be known.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether the call to UT_GetStubEntry and the subsequent pointer dereferences/assignments perform observable actions; only with that knowledge can one conclude whether any operations in UT_GetStubRetcodeAndCount are dead (i.e., removable without changing program behaviour)."
