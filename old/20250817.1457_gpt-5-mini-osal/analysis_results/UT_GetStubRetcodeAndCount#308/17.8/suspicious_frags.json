  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Reasoning:\n- The only pointer parameters are int32 *Retcode and int32 *Count; the function writes to the objects they point to via dereference (*Retcode = ..., *Count = ...). That is explicitly permitted by the rule (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified).\n- Neither pointer parameter is reassigned or otherwise modified (there are no statements such as Retcode = ..., Count = ..., ++Retcode, etc.). The rule prohibits modification of the pointer itself; no such modification occurs.\n- The other parameter, FuncKey, is passed by value and is not modified in the function body.\n- All other assignments (to the local variable Result and to StubPtr) are to local variables, not to function parameters.\n\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that violate or appear to violate Rule 17.8 and nothing more needs to be escalated for investigation."
