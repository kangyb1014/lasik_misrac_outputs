  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_Merge:\n```c\nvoid UtList_Merge(UtListNode_t *TagHead1, UtListNode_t *TagHead2)\n{\n    UtListNode_t *Tail1 = TagHead1->Prev;\n    UtListNode_t *Tail2 = TagHead2->Prev;\n\n    Tail1->Next    = TagHead2;\n    Tail2->Next    = TagHead1;\n    TagHead1->Prev = Tail2;\n    TagHead2->Prev = Tail1;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtList_Merge:\nUtListNode_t *UtList_GetHead(UtListHead_t *ListHead, uint32 Tag)\n{\n    if (Tag >= ListHead->NumberOfTags)\n    {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    return &ListHead->Tags[Tag];\n}\n...\nUtListNode_t *UtList_GetNext(UtListNode_t *ListNode)\n{\n    return ListNode->Next;\n}\n...\nvoid *UtList_GetObject(UtListNode_t *ListNode)\n{\n    return ListNode->Data;\n}\n...\nvoid UtList_Destroy(UtListHead_t *ListHead)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i)\n    {\n        UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]);\n    }\n    free(ListHead);\n}\n...\nvoid UT_BSP_Lock(void)\n{\n    OS_BSP_Lock_Impl();\n}\n...\nvoid UT_BSP_Unlock(void)\n{\n    OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl();\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nTail1->Next    = TagHead2;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment Tail1->Next = TagHead2; is required to link the tail of the first circular doubly-linked list to the head of the second list during a merge. Removing this assignment would leave Tail1->Next still pointing to TagHead1 (its old value), breaking the merged list traversal and changing program behaviour. No other statement in the function establishes Tail1->Next, so the operation is not redundant or dead."
