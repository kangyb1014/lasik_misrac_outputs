  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UtList_Merge:\n```c\nvoid UtList_Merge(UtListNode_t *TagHead1, UtListNode_t *TagHead2)\n{\n    UtListNode_t *Tail1 = TagHead1->Prev;\n    UtListNode_t *Tail2 = TagHead2->Prev;\n\n    Tail1->Next    = TagHead2;\n    Tail2->Next    = TagHead1;\n    TagHead1->Prev = Tail2;\n    TagHead2->Prev = Tail1;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function UtList_Merge:\nUtListNode_t *UtList_GetHead(UtListHead_t *ListHead, uint32 Tag)\n{\n    if (Tag >= ListHead->NumberOfTags)\n    {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    return &ListHead->Tags[Tag];\n}\n...\nUtListNode_t *UtList_GetNext(UtListNode_t *ListNode)\n{\n    return ListNode->Next;\n}\n...\nvoid *UtList_GetObject(UtListNode_t *ListNode)\n{\n    return ListNode->Data;\n}\n...\nvoid UtList_Destroy(UtListHead_t *ListHead)\n{\n    uint32 i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < ListHead->NumberOfTags; ++i)\n    {\n        UtList_Reset(&ListHead->Tags[i]);\n    }\n    free(ListHead);\n}\n...\nvoid UT_BSP_Lock(void)\n{\n    OS_BSP_Lock_Impl();\n}\n...\nvoid UT_BSP_Unlock(void)\n{\n    OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl();\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nTail2->Next    = TagHead1;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The assignment Tail2->Next = TagHead1; is necessary to link the forward pointer of Tail2 to the head of the first list when merging two circular doubly linked lists. Removing this statement would leave Tail2->Next still pointing to TagHead2 (its old value), while TagHead1->Prev would be set to Tail2, producing an inconsistent list (Prev and Next no longer mirror each other) and changing program behaviour. UtList_GetNext() returns the Next field, so traversal semantics depend on this assignment. Therefore this statement is not dead code and Rule 2.2 is not violated."
