  "explanation": "No use of any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) is present in the UtList_Merge implementation. The function only performs pointer member accesses and assignments (Next/Prev) on UtListNode_t objects. Rule 21.17 concerns accesses beyond object bounds caused by the string-handling functions; since none of those functions are called here, there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation under Rule 21.17. (Note: potential null or invalid pointer dereferences in TagHead1/TagHead2 or their Prev/Next members are general safety/robustness concerns but are not relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17.)"
