  "explanation": "Although UtList_Merge contains no direct calls to string.h functions, to determine definitively that it does not (indirectly) use any of those functions or perform out-of-bounds accesses you must inspect the concrete definitions it touches: 1) UtListNode_t (struct definition) \u2014 to verify that Prev and Next are plain pointers (not arrays, bit-fields, or types whose assignment/field access could hide calls to library routines). 2) Prev (member or macro/inline accessor) \u2014 if Prev is actually implemented as a macro or inline accessor it might expand to code that calls memcpy/strcpy/etc.; you must check its definition. 3) Next (member or macro/inline accessor) \u2014 same reason as Prev. 4) The header/translation unit that defines UtListNode_t and Prev/Next (e.g., utlist.h) \u2014 to find any macros or inline routines, and any included headers that could introduce string.h usage. 5) Any inline functions or macros that implement list-member accessors or assignments (for example project-specific wrappers) \u2014 these could perform hidden memory operations (memcpy/memmove/etc.) that would bring the function under the MISRA string.h rule. Checking these symbols ensures there are no hidden uses of <string.h> functions or indirect out-of-bounds memory operations in the assignments inside UtList_Merge."
