  "explanation": "To determine whether UtList_Merge uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the list node type and any surrounding declarations that could hide extensions. Specifically:\n\n- UtListNode_t (full typedef/struct declaration): The function only manipulates members of this type. The struct/typedef could itself use compiler extensions (e.g. attributes, compiler-specific storage-class specifiers, anonymous/extension-only constructs). We need the exact declaration to check for any non-standard keywords or extensions.\n\n- UtListNode_t::Prev member declaration: The Prev member's declaration might use an extension (e.g. unusual pointer qualifiers, custom macros expanding to __attribute__ or compiler keywords). Knowing its exact declaration is necessary to detect extensions.\n\n- UtListNode_t::Next member declaration: Same rationale as Prev \u2014 the member declaration may contain macros or attributes that are compiler-specific.\n\n- Any macros used in the UtListNode_t declaration (e.g. PACKED/ATTRIBUTE wrappers): Many projects hide compiler extensions behind macros (PACKED, ATTRIBUTES, COMPILER_DEPENDENT_DECL). You must see the macro definitions to know whether they expand to standard C or to compiler extensions such as __attribute__((packed)), __packed, __aligned__, etc.\n\n- Typedefs used inside the UtListNode_t definition (any member types): If members use other typedefs (e.g. platform integer typedefs or opaque pointer typedefs) those typedefs may themselves be defined using compiler-specific constructs. Inspect them to ensure no extensions are used.\n\n- Translation-unit pragmas/attributes that affect declarations/structure layout (e.g. #pragma pack, __attribute__ on the struct or members): Pragmas or file-level attributes can introduce implementation-specific behavior or use compiler extensions; these must be reviewed to determine compliance with the MISRA restriction on language extensions.\n\nProviding these symbols (the full declarations and any macros/attributes affecting them) is sufficient to decide if UtList_Merge depends on or uses any language/compiler extensions."
