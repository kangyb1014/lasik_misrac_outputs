  "explanation": "1) UtListNode_t (full struct/typedef definition): Required to see the exact types and qualifiers of the Prev and Next members (for example, whether they are pointers, pointer-to-const, arrays, or something else). MISRA allows modification of the object pointed-to but forbids modifying the value of a pointer parameter itself; knowing the member types/qualifiers lets us determine whether the assignments (Tail1->Next = TagHead2, etc.) modify the pointee object or the parameter pointer itself.\n\n2) UtList_Merge prototype/declaration (header): The function definition in the translation unit may match a prototype that uses const or different pointer qualifiers (e.g., UtListNode_t * const or const UtListNode_t *). The prototype can change whether the pointer parameter itself or the pointed-to object is intended to be modifiable; we must confirm the declared parameter types to check for a MISRA violation.\n\n3) Preprocessor symbols or macros named Prev or Next (or accessor macros/functions): If Prev or Next are implemented as macros or accessor functions (or expand to something other than plain struct members), the apparent member assignments might actually modify the parameter variable itself or have other side effects. We must inspect any such macros/inline helpers to ensure the code does not alter the pointer parameters.\n\n4) Typedefs used inside UtListNode_t (any pointer typedefs used for Prev/Next): If Prev/Next use typedefs (for example a typedef that hides a pointer-to-pointer or const qualifiers), those typedefs affect whether the assignments change the parameter pointer or the pointee. The concrete typedef definitions are needed to interpret the assignments correctly with respect to the MISRA rule."
