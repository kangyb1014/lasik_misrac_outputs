  "explanation": "Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The provided function contains no calls to memcmp (or any other string-comparison function), no use of string.h, and no operations on character arrays or null-terminated strings. It only performs pointer manipulations on UtListNode_t->Prev/Next members (of type UtListNode_t *), so there is nothing in this fragment that could violate Rule 21.14. Therefore no code fragments in this function need investigation for that rule."
