  "explanation": "To determine whether UtList_Merge violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must confirm there is no hidden use of memcmp or a memcmp-like operation inside the simple pointer assignments shown. Specifically:\n\n- UtListNode_t (struct typedef/definition): You must inspect the struct to verify that Next and Prev are pointer fields (e.g. pointers to UtListNode_t) and not some other type (for example embedded char arrays) that might imply a string comparison is occurring.\n\n- Definitions / typedefs of the Next and Prev members (their types): Even if you have the struct, any typedefs used as the member types must be known so you can be sure those assignments are plain pointer assignments, not macro-expanded or overloaded constructs.\n\n- Any macros or inline functions that redefine or wrap member access/assignment for Next or Prev: Although the source shows direct '->' member access, project headers could define macros with the same names (or inline setters/getters) that expand to function calls which might call memcmp. You must check for any such macros/wrappers to ensure the assignments are not hiding a memcmp call.\n\n- Any preprocessor macro that renames/rebinds memcmp: The project may #define memcmp to a different identifier or wrapper; to detect uses you need to know whether a call to some other symbol (or an expanded macro) maps to memcmp semantics.\n\n- Prototype/declaration of memcmp (string.h): To check if memcmp is used anywhere related to this function you need the standard declaration to match against and to ensure there is no confusion with similarly named project functions.\n\n- Any project-specific memcmp wrapper functions or aliases: If the code uses project wrappers instead of the standard memcmp, those wrappers must be inspected to see whether they are used to compare NUL-terminated strings (which would trigger the MISRA rule).\n\n- Header file(s) that declare/define UtListNode_t and the above macros: Include the headers so the analyzer can resolve macros, typedefs and any redefinitions that could cause the apparent pointer assignments to actually perform string comparisons.\n\nCollecting these symbols/headers lets the next analyst verify that the four pointer assignments in UtList_Merge are purely pointer manipulations and do not expand (via macros/wrappers/typedefs) into memcmp calls that compare null-terminated strings."
