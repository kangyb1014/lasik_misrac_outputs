  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided snippets. Reasoning by function:\n\n- UtList_Merge: contains four sequential pointer assignments with no conditional branches, returns, or loops. Every statement is potentially reachable when the function is called; there is no code following an unconditional jump or an infinite loop, so no unreachable statements are present.\n\n- UtTest_Run: the control flow consists of sequential calls, a for-loop driven by list traversal, and conditional if-blocks that are entered only when their conditions hold. There are no unconditional returns, goto jumps, or infinite loops that would make subsequent code unreachable. The loop termination depends on UtList_IsEnd, so loop body and following code are reachable depending on list contents and are not statically unreachable.\n\n- OS_Application_Run: contains a single call to OS_IdleLoop(). If OS_IdleLoop() were implemented as a non-returning infinite loop, then any code after that call would be unreachable; however, in the provided snippet there is no code following the call, so there is no unreachable code here.\n\nNote: parts of the project are omitted (ellipsis). Only the provided code was analyzed. If other files or omitted code include constructs such as unconditional returns followed by code, infinite loops followed by code, or deliberate unconditional goto/jump targets that cause subsequent code to be unreachable, those specific fragments would need to be inspected. Based on the visible code, there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
