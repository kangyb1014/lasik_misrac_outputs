  "explanation": "To determine whether UtList_Merge is unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code) you must trace the call graph back to program entry points: \n- UtTest_Run: UtList_Merge is directly called by UtTest_Run (given by the static call graph). You need the body/signature of UtTest_Run to confirm the call is unconditional/actually reachable and not behind dead code (e.g., compiled-out conditional, unreachable branch, or removed by preprocessor).  \n- OS_Application_Run: UtTest_Run is called by OS_Application_Run according to the call graph. You need this symbol to confirm whether UtTest_Run itself is reachable from higher-level code (is the call made unconditionally, guarded by dead/preprocessed code, or behind a never-taken path).\n- main (or runtime entry such as Reset_Handler / system startup): To conclude a function is reachable at program level you must start from a program entry point. Include the actual program entry (main or the platform Reset_Handler / startup function) to confirm whether OS_Application_Run is invoked at runtime. If OS_Application_Run is never invoked from any entry, UtList_Merge may be unreachable.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyzer perform a forward/backward reachability analysis from program entry to UtList_Merge and determine if the function is genuinely unreachable (violating the MISRA rule) or reachable during normal execution."
