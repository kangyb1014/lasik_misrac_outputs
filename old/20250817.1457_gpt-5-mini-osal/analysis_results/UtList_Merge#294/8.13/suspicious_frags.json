  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rule 8.13 recommends that pointers point to const-qualified types whenever the pointed-to object is not modified. In this function every pointer that appears (the parameters TagHead1 and TagHead2 and the local pointers Tail1 and Tail2) is used to modify the pointee(s):\n- Tail1 and Tail2 are assigned from TagHead1->Prev and TagHead2->Prev and are then used to write to Tail1->Next and Tail2->Next (Tail1->Next = TagHead2; Tail2->Next = TagHead1;). These modify the objects they point to, so they cannot point to const-qualified types.\n- TagHead1 and TagHead2 are used to write to their Prev members (TagHead1->Prev = Tail2; TagHead2->Prev = Tail1;), so the objects they point to are modified and the pointers cannot point to const-qualified types.\nBecause every pointer in the function is used to perform modifications on the pointed-to UtListNode_t objects, none can be made to point to const-qualified types; therefore there are no suspicious fragments with respect to Rule 8.13."
