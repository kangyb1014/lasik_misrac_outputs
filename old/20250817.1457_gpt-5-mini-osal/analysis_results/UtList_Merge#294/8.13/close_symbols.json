  "explanation": "- UtListNode_t (struct/typedef definition): Required to know the exact types of Prev and Next (are they pointers to UtListNode_t, const-qualified, or some other type) and whether modifying their members constitutes modifying object state. Without the struct definition you cannot determine if the function writes through non-const pointers or if members are already const.\n- Prototype/declaration of UtList_Merge: The public declaration (header) may differ in qualifiers from the definition. To check MISRA rule compliance you must compare the function definition signature against the declared prototype to see whether const could or should be used there.\n- UtTest_Run (implementation / call-site): Needed to see how UtList_Merge is called (what kinds of UtListNode_t pointers are passed). If callers provide const-qualified pointers, that would indicate a const-correctness mismatch; if callers only use mutable pointers, const would likely be inappropriate.\n- UtList_GetHead, UtList_GetNext, UtList_GetObject (prototypes/implementations): These functions produce or return UtListNode_t pointers used around the list API. Their return types and const-qualification determine whether callers expect const or non-const node pointers and whether UtList_Merge could accept const pointers.\n- Any typedefs or macros that add const-qualification to UtListNode_t or its members: Some codebases use typedefs or macros to produce const-qualified variants; these could affect whether the pointer types in this API should be const. Knowing these ensures accurate determination of whether pointers could/should be const under MISRA.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the analyzer determine whether the function actually modifies pointed-to data (so const is inappropriate), whether the public API/prototypes allow const, and whether callers expect const-qualified pointers \u2014 all necessary to decide MISRA rule compliance."
