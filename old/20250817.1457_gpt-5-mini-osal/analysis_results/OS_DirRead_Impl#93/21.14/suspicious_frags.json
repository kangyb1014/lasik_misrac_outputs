  "explanation": "I found no use of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided OS_DirRead_Impl function or in the related symbol definitions. The function calls in the fragment are readdir and strncpy; neither is memcmp, and there are no explicit byte-wise comparisons of null-terminated strings using memcmp. The related type and macro definitions shown also contain no memcmp usage. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
