  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. The control flow is straightforward and every statement is potentially executable: the table lookup and assignment to impl precede the call to readdir(), which may return NULL (leading to the early return OS_ERROR) or non-NULL (leading to the strncpy, explicit null-termination, and return OS_SUCCESS). The comment and cppcheck-suppress directives are not executable code. The macro expansion for OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and the inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken are used in a way that yields a valid address expression at runtime (assuming the caller supplies a valid token pointer) and do not introduce any statically unreachable code paths. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that are provably unreachable and requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
