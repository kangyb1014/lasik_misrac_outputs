  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer 'impl' refers to an internal record whose member 'dp' (a DIR *) is passed to readdir(), which requires a non-const DIR *. Qualifying the pointed-to type as const would prevent this use. Therefore the pointer must be non-const and the assignment from OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET is appropriate."
