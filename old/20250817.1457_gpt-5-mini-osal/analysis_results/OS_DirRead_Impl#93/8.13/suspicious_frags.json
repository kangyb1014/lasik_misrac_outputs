  "explanation": "I did not flag other fragments because they do not present potential violations of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' is already const-qualified; the parameter 'os_dirent_t *dirent' is an output buffer that is written to (strncpy and the explicit NUL), so it must be a non-const pointer; the use of strncpy and the explicit terminator modify the destination intentionally and are therefore expected to be non-const. The listed fragments are the places where non-const pointers are declared or assigned but only read from afterward (or could be made to point to const-qualified types), so they warrant investigation to determine if they could/should be changed to point to const-qualified types."
