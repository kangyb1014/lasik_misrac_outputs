Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be to a const-qualified type when possible. It should be declared as 'const struct dirent *de;' (assigning the non-const return of readdir to a const pointer is allowed).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nint32 OS_DirRead_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, os_dirent_t *dirent)\n{\n    struct dirent *                de;\n    OS_impl_dir_internal_record_t *impl;\n    FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/747.txt\", \"a\");\n\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"OS_DirRead_Impl: entry token=%p, dirent=%p\\n\", (const void *)token, (void *)dirent);\n    }\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_dir_table, *token);\n\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Log impl and its DIR* handle (impl may be NULL in some failure scenarios) */\n        fprintf(log, \"OS_DirRead_Impl: impl=%p\\n\", (void *)impl);\n        if (impl != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(log, \"OS_DirRead_Impl: impl->dp=%p\\n\", (void *)impl->dp);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* NOTE - the readdir() call is non-reentrant ....\n     * However, this is performed while the global dir table lock is taken.\n     * Therefore this ensures that only one such call can occur at any given time.\n     *\n     * Static analysis tools may warn about this because they do not know\n     * this function is externally serialized via the global lock.\n     */\n    /* cppcheck-suppress readdirCalled */\n    /* cppcheck-suppress nonreentrantFunctionsreaddir */\n    de = readdir(impl->dp);\n\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"OS_DirRead_Impl: readdir returned de=%p\\n\", (void *)de);\n    }\n\n    if (de == NULL)\n    {\n        if (log != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(log, \"OS_DirRead_Impl: de is NULL -> returning OS_ERROR\\n\");\n            fclose(log);\n        }\n\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Capture the name read from the dirent returned by readdir */\n        fprintf(log, \"OS_DirRead_Impl: de->d_name=\\\"%s\\\"\\n\", de->d_name);\n    }\n\n    strncpy(dirent->FileName, de->d_name, sizeof(dirent->FileName) - 1);\n    dirent->FileName[sizeof(dirent->FileName) - 1] = 0;\n\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"OS_DirRead_Impl: copied FileName=\\\"%s\\\" -> returning OS_SUCCESS\\n\", dirent->FileName);\n        fclose(log);\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_DirRead_Impl.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In the shown function the local pointer de is only used for read-only access (de->d_name is read and copied) and therefore can and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (e.g. const struct dirent *de) per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Assigning the non-const return value of readdir (struct dirent *) to a pointer-to-const is allowed and enforces immutability via this pointer; there is no evidence in the snippet of any write-through or calls requiring a non-const struct dirent *. If the code later needed to modify the structure or pass it to APIs expecting a non-const pointer, that would be a reason not to add const, but that is not the case here."
