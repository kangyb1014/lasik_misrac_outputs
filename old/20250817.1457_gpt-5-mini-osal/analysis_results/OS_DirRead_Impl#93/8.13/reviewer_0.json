  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. In OS_DirRead_Impl the local pointer de is only used for reading (accessing de->d_name) and never used to modify the pointed-to object. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 advises that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, so de should be declared as const struct dirent *de. Assigning the result of readdir (which returns struct dirent *) to const struct dirent * is allowed and preserves the intent that this function does not modify the dirent. The fact that readdir returns a non-const pointer for historical reasons or that the underlying buffer is reused by subsequent readdir calls does not prevent declaring the local pointer as pointing to const. Thus the agent A\u2019s violation report is valid (unless a project-specific deviation/exemption for this rule is documented)."
