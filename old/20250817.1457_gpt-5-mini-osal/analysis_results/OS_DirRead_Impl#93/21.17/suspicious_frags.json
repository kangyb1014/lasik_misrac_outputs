  "suspicious_frags": [
    "    dirent->FileName[sizeof(dirent->FileName) - 1] = 0;",
    "    strncpy(dirent->FileName, de->d_name, sizeof(dirent->FileName) - 1);"
  ],
  "explanation": "Only the two lines above involve string handling and potential buffer-size issues. They should be investigated to ensure sizeof(dirent->FileName) is the correct destination size, that sizeof(...) - 1 does not underflow (e.g. if FileName size is 0), and that de->d_name is a valid NUL-terminated source compatible with strncpy usage. Other lines do not call functions from <string.h> and therefore do not fall under Rule 21.17: readdir usage, token/table access, the NULL check for de, and the return statements do not perform string library operations and so need not be investigated for this rule. No other string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in the function."
