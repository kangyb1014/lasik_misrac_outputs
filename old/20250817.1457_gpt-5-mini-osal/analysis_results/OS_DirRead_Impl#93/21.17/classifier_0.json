  "scenario": "No \u2014 the shown write does not by itself violate Rule 21.17. In the provided code FileName is treated as an array: strncpy uses sizeof(dirent->FileName)-1 so at most indices 0..N-2 are written, and the explicit assignment dirent->FileName[sizeof(dirent->FileName)-1] = 0 writes the last (in\u2011bounds) element to ensure termination. A violation scenario would be if FileName were actually a pointer (or otherwise not a compile\u2011time array) so that sizeof(dirent->FileName) yields the size of the pointer rather than the buffer length; in that case the strncpy length would be incorrect and the explicit write could index beyond the real buffer, causing an out\u2011of\u2011bounds access."
