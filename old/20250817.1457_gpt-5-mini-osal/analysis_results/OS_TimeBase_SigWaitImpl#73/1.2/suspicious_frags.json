  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. I checked for common explicit compiler extensions (and found none):\n- No GCC/Clang-specific keywords or built-ins (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __asm__, __label__ or nested functions).\n- No statement-expression ({ ... }) expressions or other GNU statement extensions.\n- No use of anonymous or zero-length arrays, nor other vendor-only syntax.\n- All declarations and syntax are standard C (file\u2011scope static function, local declarations at the top, normal identifiers and typedefs).\n\nNotes for completeness: the call to sigwait is a POSIX library function (not a language extension) and custom identifiers/macros (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_impl_timebase_table, etc.) appear in the code but their presence here does not itself indicate a language extension. If required, their definitions (macro expansions or implementation) should be inspected since a macro or implementation elsewhere could use compiler-specific extensions; however, nothing in this shown fragment explicitly uses a documented compiler language extension, so no fragments within this file need investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2."
