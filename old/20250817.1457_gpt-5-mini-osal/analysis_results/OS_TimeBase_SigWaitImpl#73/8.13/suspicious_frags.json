  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations and usages that could (and should) point to const-qualified types. The selected fragments include the pointer declarations, their initializations from the object tables, and the subsequent uses of those pointers for reads and writes; these are the locations that need investigation to determine whether const qualification is feasible or appropriate. Other lines in the function do not declare or use pointers in a way relevant to Rule 8.13 (they are scalar locals, control flow, return, or calls not involving pointer-to-object typing) and therefore do not need further investigation for this rule. Additionally, implicit conversion of a non-const pointer to a const parameter (as in passing &impl->sigset to a function expecting const sigset_t *) is permitted; only pointer declarations/usages that could be made to point to const-qualified types are reported above."
