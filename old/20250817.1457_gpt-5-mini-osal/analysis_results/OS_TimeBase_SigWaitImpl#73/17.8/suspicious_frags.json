  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter, obj_id, which is passed by value and is never assigned to or otherwise modified in the function (no direct assignment, no increment/decrement, and its address is not taken to alter the parameter variable itself). All other writes in the function are to local variables (interval_time, ret, sig, token, impl, timebase) or to objects pointed to by local pointers (e.g., impl->reset_flag = 0), which is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified \u2014 here there are no pointer parameters \u2014 and modifying objects via local pointers is not a modification of a function parameter). Calls such as OS_ObjectIdGetById(...) pass obj_id by value and use &token to return information; sigwait(&impl->sigset, &sig) writes into the local sig variable. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
