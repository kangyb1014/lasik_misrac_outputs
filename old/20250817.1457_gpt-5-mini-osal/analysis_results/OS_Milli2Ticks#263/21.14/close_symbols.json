  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_Milli2Ticks violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of the Standard Library function memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must be able to detect any direct or indirect use of memcmp inside the target function (or through any wrappers/macros it calls). Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- memcmp: The standard function named in the MISRA rule. The analyzer must know if this exact symbol is referenced by the function (direct call) and see how its arguments are formed to determine whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp_s / secure_memcmp: Common alternative/secure variants or platform-specific names for memory comparison routines. They have the same risk when used to compare null\u2011terminated strings; include them so the analysis finds these variants.\n\n- OS_Memcmp / platform_memcmp: Typical codebase wrapper names around memcmp. The target function may not call them directly, but they could appear in inline helpers or macros; the analyzer must treat these as potential aliases for memcmp.\n\n- MEMCMP (macro) / COMPARE_MEMORY (macro): memcmp is sometimes hidden behind macros. The analysis must expand/resolve macros to detect whether a macro invocation maps to memcmp (and thus could violate the rule if used on C strings).\n\nNotes for the analyst: search the static call graph and preprocessor expansions for these symbols (and other similarly named wrappers/aliases in the codebase). If none of these symbols (or aliases/macros that resolve to them) are reachable from OS_Milli2Ticks, then the function does not violate the memcmp-specific MISRA rule. If any are reachable, inspect the call sites/arguments to determine whether they are being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
