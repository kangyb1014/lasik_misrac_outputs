  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Milli2Ticks violates MISRA's guidance that a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible you must know not only the body of this function but also the intended interface and how it is used:\n\n- OS_Milli2Ticks (function prototype / declaration in its header): The declared prototype may differ (e.g. const qualifiers on the parameter) from the implementation. The header shows the intended API contract (input vs output parameter) and any const qualification applied at the declaration level.\n\n- Call sites of OS_Milli2Ticks (all locations that call this function): MISRA's rule is about whether the pointed-to type can be const. If callers expect the function to write an output into *ticks, the parameter must be a non-const int*. Examining all callers shows whether the parameter is used as an output (written) or only read (in which case it should be const-qualified).\n\n- Declarations of the variables passed as the 'ticks' argument at each call site (including const/volatile qualification): Even if callers pass an lvalue address, the type/qualification of that lvalue matters (e.g. passing the address of a const int is an issue, or callers may cast away const). You need these declarations to determine whether const could be used safely.\n\n- Any header macros or conditional compilation that can change the signature of OS_Milli2Ticks (e.g. macro wrappers/alternate prototypes): Platform- or configuration-specific macros might change the parameter types or add qualifiers; these can affect whether the implementation is consistent with the declared API and MISRA guidance.\n\n- Definition of OS_SharedGlobalVars (type and member TicksPerSecond): Although not directly about the 'ticks' pointer qualification, this global affects how the function computes the value stored through the pointer. Knowing whether TicksPerSecond is const or has side effects helps conclude whether the pointer is only written (output) and thus must remain non-const, or whether the function could be restructured to avoid writing via the pointer.\n\nWith these symbols you can determine whether the parameter should be const-qualified (i.e. it is used only for input) or correctly remains non-const because the function writes to *ticks (an output parameter)."
