  "explanation": "To determine whether this function can violate the MISRA C rule about string.h functions you must be able to prove there are no hidden/indirect string operations or buffer accesses behind any referenced symbol. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars (complete definition): the struct/variable definition is needed to ensure it does not contain or expand to pointer(s) to character buffers or function-like macros that could invoke string-handling functions. If OS_SharedGlobalVars were a macro or contained members that trigger string operations, that would matter for the MISRA string-rule analysis.\n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond (member type and declaration): the member must be shown to be an integer type (or otherwise safe) and not a pointer, macro wrapper, or expression that could call into string functions or reference character buffers.\n\n- INT_MAX (macro): used in the bounds check. Its definition confirms the intended comparison and that no hidden side effects or function-like macros are involved. Also needed to reason correctly about the numeric range and the cast to int for *ticks.\n\n- uint64, uint32, int32 (typedefs): need the exact typedefs to confirm integer widths, signedness and to reason about whether the arithmetic (cast/multiply) could invoke any unusual behavior or hidden macros that reference buffers. This also ensures the multiplication and cast semantics are plain integer arithmetic, not wrapped by macros that perform other actions.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS, OS_ERROR (definitions): confirm these are simple integer constants (enum or macro) and not macros that expand to code calling string functions or performing buffer operations.\n\n- Declaration/definition locations (header files) for the above symbols: where they are defined (project headers) is necessary to inspect for any macro expansion or side effects that could introduce calls to string.h functions.\n\nIf all of the above are plain integer types/constants/macros with no side effects, and no other symbols (macros/functions) are involved, then OS_Milli2Ticks contains no calls to the string.h functions and therefore cannot violate the stated MISRA rule. If any of the listed items are macros or wrappers, their definitions must be examined to ensure they do not invoke string-handling functions or operate on character buffers."
