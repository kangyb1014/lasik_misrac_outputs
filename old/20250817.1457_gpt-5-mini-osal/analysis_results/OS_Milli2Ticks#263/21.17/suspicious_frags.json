  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions are present in the provided code. The function performs integer arithmetic, a bounds check against INT_MAX, and writes to an int pointer ( *ticks ). None of these operations involve the Standard Library string handling functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), so there is no potential for accesses beyond object bounds caused by string.h functions as covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Therefore, no code fragments need to be investigated for this rule."
