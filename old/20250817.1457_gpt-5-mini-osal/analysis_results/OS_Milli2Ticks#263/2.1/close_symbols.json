  "explanation": "To determine whether either branch of the if (num_of_ticks <= INT_MAX) can never be taken (i.e. whether some code is unreachable), you must be able to compute the possible range of num_of_ticks and compare it to INT_MAX. That requires:  \n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars: the struct definition and any documented invariants are needed so you know where TicksPerSecond comes from and whether the field has implicit limits enforced elsewhere. Without this you cannot reason about its runtime values.  \n\n- OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond: the numeric type and the allowed/configured range (minimum/maximum) directly affect the product (milli_seconds * TicksPerSecond); if TicksPerSecond is always small enough the else branch may be unreachable.  \n\n- typedef uint32: the exact width/range of the milli_seconds parameter (0..UINT32_MAX) is required to compute the maximum possible multiplicand. If uint32 differs from 32 bits in this project the numeric bounds change.  \n\n- typedef uint64: the width and behavior of the 64-bit type used for the intermediate multiplication are needed to ensure no wrap/overflow and to determine the maximum of num_of_ticks.  \n\n- typedef int32: the width/range of int32 (used as return type) can affect interpretation of return values and may be relevant if project typedefs differ from standard widths.  \n\n- int / INT_MAX: the width of int on the target platform and the actual value of INT_MAX (from limits.h) are required because the conditional compares num_of_ticks to INT_MAX; whether the condition can ever be false depends on this value.  \n\n- Project configuration macros or caller preconditions on milli_seconds: if the project restricts the allowed milli_seconds values (via macros, API docs, or validation performed by callers), that reduces the domain of milli_seconds and can make one branch impossible. You must know any such constraints to judge reachability.  \n\n(Notes: OS_SUCCESS/OS_ERROR values do not affect reachability of the branches; they only affect what is returned after choosing a branch.)"
