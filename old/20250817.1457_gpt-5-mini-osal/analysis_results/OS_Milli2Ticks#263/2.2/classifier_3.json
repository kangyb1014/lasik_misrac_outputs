  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_Milli2Ticks:\n```c\nint32 OS_Milli2Ticks(uint32 milli_seconds, int *ticks)\n{\n    uint64 num_of_ticks;\n    int32  return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n\n    num_of_ticks = (((uint64)milli_seconds * OS_SharedGlobalVars.TicksPerSecond) + 999) / 1000;\n\n    /* Check against maximum int32 (limit from some OS's) */\n    if (num_of_ticks <= INT_MAX)\n    {\n        *ticks = (int)num_of_ticks;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n        *ticks      = 0;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nint32  return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The initialization of return_code to OS_SUCCESS is used as the default return value when num_of_ticks <= INT_MAX; removing it would change the function's behaviour. Also per MISRA note 3, initialization is not treated as dead code. Therefore this initialization is not dead code."
