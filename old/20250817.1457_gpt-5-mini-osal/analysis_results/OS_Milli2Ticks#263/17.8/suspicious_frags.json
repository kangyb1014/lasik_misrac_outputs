  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying function parameters themselves; it allows modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter. In OS_Milli2Ticks the value parameter milli_seconds is never assigned to, and the pointer parameter ticks is not reassigned anywhere in the function. The code only writes to *ticks, which is explicitly permitted by the rule. All other assignments (num_of_ticks, return_code) are to local variables. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
