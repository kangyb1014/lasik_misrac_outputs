  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either involve pointers that must be mutable (e.g. the output buffer which is written to via buffer[0] = 0 and memcpy, so it cannot be const), are non-pointer objects (return_code, name_len, token type itself when passed by address to APIs that manage tokens), or are macro/API usages that require non-const arguments by design (OS_CHECK_POINTER, OS_CHECK_SIZE, OS_ObjectIdGetById). No other pointer expressions in the function are purely read-only and therefore candidates for const-qualification."
