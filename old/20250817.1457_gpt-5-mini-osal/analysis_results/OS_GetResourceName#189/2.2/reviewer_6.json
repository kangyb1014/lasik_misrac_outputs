For example, if BUGCHECK is defined so the boolean expression is only evaluated and its result discarded (e.g. #define BUGCHECK(expr,code) ((void)(expr))) then OS_CHECK_POINTER(ptr) expands to ((void)((ptr)!=NULL)); the evaluation has no side\u2011effects, so it is an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour \u2014 this is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, conversely, BUGCHECK performs an observable action such as logging/abort on failure, then no violation occurs.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_ProbeLog(const char *stage, const void *buffer, size_t buffer_size, int32_t return_code, const char *extra)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/1514.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Keep logging simple and robust; do not change program state */\n    fprintf(f, \"stage=%s ptr=%p buffer_size=%zu return_code=%ld extra=%s\\n\",\n            stage,\n            buffer,\n            buffer_size,\n            (long)return_code,\n            (extra != NULL) ? extra : \"(null)\");\n\n    fclose(f);\n}\nstatic void OS_ProbeLogNum(const char *stage, const void *buffer, size_t buffer_size, int32_t return_code, long num)\n{\n    char extra[32];\n    (void)snprintf(extra, sizeof(extra), \"%ld\", num);\n    OS_ProbeLog(stage, buffer, buffer_size, return_code, extra);\n}\n\nint32 OS_GetResourceName(osal_id_t object_id, char *buffer, size_t buffer_size)\n{\n    OS_common_record_t *record;\n    int32               return_code;\n    size_t              name_len;\n    OS_object_token_t   token;\n\n    /* Probe: entry and values before performing the sanity checks */\n    OS_ProbeLog(\"entry_before_checks\", buffer, buffer_size, -1, NULL);\n\n    /* sanity check the passed-in buffer and size */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(buffer);\n    OS_CHECK_SIZE(buffer_size);\n\n    /* Probe: after sanity-check macros.

  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. Whether the code violates MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 depends on how OS_CHECK_POINTER (and the underlying BUGCHECK) is defined. If BUGCHECK expands to an observable action (e.g. logging, assert/abort), then the macro has an effect and there is no dead code. However, if BUGCHECK is defined as a no-op that simply evaluates and discards a boolean expression (for example #define BUGCHECK(expr,code) ((void)(expr))), then OS_CHECK_POINTER(buffer) typically expands to something like ((void)((buffer) != NULL)); that comparison has no side-effects and executing it does not change program behaviour. According to Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), that expansion would be dead code and therefore a violation. In short: the reported violation is correct in the configuration where the macro is a no-op; it is not a violation when the macro performs an observable action (logging/abort/etc.). Recommended actions: ensure the macro expands to an observable check in the project configuration or remove/adjust the no-op definitions so the project contains no executed-but-effectless operations."
