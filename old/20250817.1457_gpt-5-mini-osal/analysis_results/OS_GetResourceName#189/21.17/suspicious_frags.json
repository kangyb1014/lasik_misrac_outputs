  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they do not perform string/byte-buffer operations that could access beyond object bounds. In particular: the calls that manage object lookup and lifetime (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdGlobalFromToken, OS_ObjectIdRelease) and the surrounding control-flow and return-code logic only query/return bookkeeping data and do not themselves copy or examine string contents. The check record->name_entry != NULL is present and prevents NULL dereference of the name pointer (the use of the name pointer itself is included in the suspicious fragments). Other assignments and variable declarations (e.g. initialization of return_code, declaration of token) do not involve <string.h> functions or buffer indexing and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17."
