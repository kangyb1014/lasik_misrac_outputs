  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: OS_CHECK_POINTER(buffer) is a pointer sanity-check macro (typically a null-pointer check) and does not call any functions from <string.h>, so the fragment itself does not cause or constitute a Rule 21.17 violation. Note: if the macro only verifies non-NULL and the buffer actually points to a smaller object than buffer_size, the subsequent OS_strnlen/memcpy usage in the surrounding function could lead to an out-of-bounds access (which would violate Rule 21.17), but that is due to the later string/memory operations, not this macro invocation."
