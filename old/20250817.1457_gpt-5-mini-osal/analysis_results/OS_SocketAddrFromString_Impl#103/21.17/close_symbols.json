  "explanation": "For the MISRA C rule about uses of <string.h> functions causing out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses we must verify that no string.h function is used and that any function that writes into the Addr buffer (here inet_pton) cannot exceed the buffer. Each listed symbol is needed as follows:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: defines the actual socket address object and, critically, the size/allocation of Addr->AddrData. We must know this to confirm addrbuffer points inside a sufficiently large object.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: describes the accessor/overlay used to interpret Addr->AddrData as sa / sa_in / sa_in6. Its layout/union semantics determine offsets and whether addrbuffer references are within bounds.\n- Addr->AddrData (storage size): the raw storage size is required to ensure that taking &Addr->AddrData interpreted members (sin_addr or sin6_addr) does not point beyond the storage and that writes by inet_pton fit.\n- struct sockaddr (sa_family): needed to understand the sa.sa_family field read in the switch and to ensure the correct branch (IPv4 vs IPv6) is selected.\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: the macros determine which member (sin_addr vs sin6_addr) is used; required to know which buffer size to check.\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct in_addr (sin_addr member and its size): to know the exact storage (typically 4 bytes) that inet_pton will write for AF_INET and ensure it fits inside Addr->AddrData.\n- struct sockaddr_in6 and struct in6_addr (sin6_addr member and its size): to know the exact storage (typically 16 bytes) that inet_pton will write for AF_INET6 and ensure it fits inside Addr->AddrData.\n- inet_pton (prototype and write/return semantics): although not a <string.h> function, inet_pton takes the input C string and writes binary address bytes into addrbuffer. To prove no out\u2011of\u2011bounds write (and thus no indirect violation related to string handling), we must know how many bytes inet_pton writes for each family, its return convention, and whether it can write beyond the provided buffer.\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: the symbolic return values are not directly related to the string.h rule but are required to fully understand control flow and error handling (to ensure the function does not attempt any additional string operations on error paths).\n\nWith these symbols available one can determine (1) whether addrbuffer always points to storage large enough for what inet_pton will write, and (2) whether any <string.h> functions are invoked (none are in this function). That is sufficient to conclude whether the given MISRA rule can be violated here."
