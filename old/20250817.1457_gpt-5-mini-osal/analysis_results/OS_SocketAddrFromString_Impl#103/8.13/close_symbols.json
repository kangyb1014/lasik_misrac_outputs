  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer in OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl should be const-qualified the analyzer must know the exact types and constness semantics involved: \n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: shows the declared type of the Addr parameter and the type/layout of AddrData; needed to determine whether Addr is intended to be an output (modifiable) object or could/should be const. \n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: provides the definitions of the accessor fields (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) and their member types; needed to know the types and const-qualification of the objects whose addresses are taken and passed to inet_pton. \n\n- Addr->AddrData (the member type inside OS_SockAddr_t): explicitly identifies what Addr->AddrData actually is (array/union/struct) so the cast to OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t and whether that points to mutable storage can be assessed. \n\n- struct in_addr: the type of Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr; needed to see whether it contains mutable members (e.g., s_addr) or has const qualifiers that would forbid writing into it. \n\n- struct in6_addr: the type of Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr; same reason as in_addr \u2014 to know if the destination buffer is modifiable or declared const. \n\n- inet_pton (prototype/signature): to confirm the parameter types (particularly whether the destination parameter is void * or const void *). If inet_pton required a const destination the call would be suspect; the usual prototype accepts void * and writes into it. \n\n- AF_INET / AF_INET6 (macros or enum values): to confirm which branches are active and which member (sin_addr vs sin6_addr) is being targeted; necessary to ensure the correct destination object/type is inspected for const-qualification.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine whether Addr (and the subobjects whose addresses are passed to inet_pton) are legitimately mutable (so no const qualification is required) or whether they are declared const and thus the function violates the MISRA guideline that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible."
