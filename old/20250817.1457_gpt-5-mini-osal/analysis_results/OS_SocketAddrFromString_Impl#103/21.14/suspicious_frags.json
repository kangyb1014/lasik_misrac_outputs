  "explanation": "I inspected the provided target function and related type/definition fragments and found no usage of the Standard Library function memcmp, nor any code that compares null-terminated strings via memcmp. The code performs: a cast to an accessor type, a switch on sa_family (integer comparisons), and a call to inet_pton to convert a string to a binary address. The union contains a char array but it is not compared with memcmp anywhere in the shown code. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that match MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings) to report."
