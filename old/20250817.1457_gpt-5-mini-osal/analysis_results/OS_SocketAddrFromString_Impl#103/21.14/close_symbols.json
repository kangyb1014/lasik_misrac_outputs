  "explanation": "For determining whether this function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyser needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- inet_pton: The only library call inside the function. We must confirm its prototype and behaviour (it takes a C string and writes binary data to dst) and check whether any implementation or wrapper could internally call memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp: The banned function itself. The analyser must know its signature and semantics to recognize any direct or indirect use (or wrappers) comparing null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: The target socket address type. Needed to see whether Addr/AddrData are character buffers or binary storage (i.e., whether any comparisons in or around this code could be comparing C strings).\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The accessor overlay used in the function. Required to understand the field layout and types (sa, sa_in, sa_in6) so we can determine whether the code manipulates/compares strings or binary address bytes.\n\n- Addr->AddrData (field): The concrete field referenced by the Accessor cast. Must be inspected to confirm it is not a null\u2011terminated string buffer that could be involved in memcmp string comparisons.\n\n- Accessor->sa.sa_family (field): Determines which branch (AF_INET / AF_INET6) is taken. Knowing its type/values ensures correct control\u2011flow analysis and whether string vs binary code paths are used.\n\n- sa_in.sin_addr and sa_in6.sin6_addr: These are the destinations passed to inet_pton (addrbuffer). Their types (binary address structures, not C strings) are needed to show the function writes binary data, not performing string comparisons.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: Family constants used in the switch. Needed for control\u2011flow resolution and to ensure the addrbuffer selection is correctly understood.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: Build conditional that enables AF_INET6 path. The analyser needs this to know whether the IPv6 branch (and its data types) is present.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyser determine (1) whether the function itself calls memcmp or another string comparison, (2) whether any called function (inet_pton or wrappers) could internally use memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, and (3) whether the data being compared would be C strings (null\u2011terminated) vs binary address bytes. If none of these symbols reveal any use of memcmp for null\u2011terminated strings, the function does not violate the MISRA rule."
