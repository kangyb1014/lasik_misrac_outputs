  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code. I checked for common extension markers such as identifiers beginning with double underscores or named compiler extensions (e.g. __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, pragmas that are implementation-specific), and none are present. The use of: - preprocessor conditional #ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 (standard preprocessor feature), - casts (e.g. (OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData), - unions and struct members, - standard macros/constants (AF_INET / AF_INET6), and - the POSIX function inet_pton, are all standard C or standard library/OS APIs rather than compiler language extensions. The extra 'break' after the 'return' is dead code but is not a language extension. Therefore there are no fragments that need further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
