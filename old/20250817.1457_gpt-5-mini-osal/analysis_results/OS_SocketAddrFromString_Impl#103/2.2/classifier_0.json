  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl(OS_SockAddr_t *Addr, const char *string)\n{\n    void *                  addrbuffer;\n    OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor;\n\n    Accessor = (OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData;\n\n    switch (Accessor->sa.sa_family)\n    {\n        case AF_INET:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr;\n            break;\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n        case AF_INET6:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr;\n            break;\n#endif\n        default:\n            return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    /* This function is defined as returning 1 on success, not 0 */\n    if (inet_pton(Accessor->sa.sa_family, string, addrbuffer) != 1)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SocketAddrFromString_Impl:\ntypedef struct\n{\n    size_t            ActualLength; /**< @brief Length of the actual address data */\n    OS_SockAddrData_t AddrData;     /**< @brief Abstract Address data */\n} OS_SockAddr_t\n...\ntypedef union\n{\n    char               data[OS_SOCKADDR_MAX_LEN];\n    struct sockaddr    sa;\n    struct sockaddr_in sa_in;\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n    struct sockaddr_in6 sa_in6;\n#endif\n} OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t\n...\n#define OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 \n...\n#define OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS (-34)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n        case AF_INET6:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr;\n            break;\n#endif\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the AF_INET6 case is conditionally compiled only when OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 is defined (it is in the provided additional code) and is used to handle sa_family == AF_INET6. The code can be executed at run-time for IPv6 addresses, and removing it would change behavior for IPv6 parsing, so it is not dead code. (If the macro were not defined the case would simply be excluded at compile time; unreachable code is not considered dead code per the rule's note.)"
