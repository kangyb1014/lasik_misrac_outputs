  "explanation": "No code fragment in the function modifies a function parameter itself. Specifically:\n- The parameter Addr is only read (used in the expression &Addr->AddrData and to access Addr->AddrData.sa.sa_family). There is no assignment to Addr (no statements like Addr = ..., Addr++, or similar), so the pointer parameter is not modified.\n- The parameter string is declared const and is only passed to inet_pton; it is not assigned to or otherwise modified in the function.\n- The only modification that may occur is via inet_pton(\u2026, addrbuffer), which writes into the object pointed to by addrbuffer. That object is Addr->AddrData (accessed through the local pointer Accessor). Modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is allowed by Rule 17.8; only modifying the pointer parameter itself is forbidden.\n- All other operations are local (assignments to local variables addrbuffer and Accessor, switch on a member value, and returns) and do not alter the parameter identifiers.\nTherefore there are no fragments that warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
