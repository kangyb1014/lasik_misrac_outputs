  "suspicious_frags": [

  "explanation": "Only the OS_DEBUG(...) line contains a call to a string-handling library function (strerror) that originates from <string.h>. The rest of the code does not use any of the string.h functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.), nor does it pass pointer parameters to such functions that could result in out-of-bounds accesses. The mq_close call and the object-table index macro do not involve <string.h> string-handling operations. Note: OS_DEBUG is defined as empty in the provided additional code, so its arguments would typically be removed by the preprocessor in this configuration; however the presence of strerror in the source means it should be investigated in case OS_DEBUG is configured differently or the call is enabled in other build variants."
