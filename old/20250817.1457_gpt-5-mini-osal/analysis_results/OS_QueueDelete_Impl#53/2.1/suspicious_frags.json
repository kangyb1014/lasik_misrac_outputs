  "explanation": "No code fragments in the provided function are demonstrably unreachable. Reasoning: \n- Control flow: both branches of the conditional (mq_close() != 0) are reachable at runtime depending on mq_close() result; the function always returns via the final return return_code; there are no statements following an unconditional return or goto that would be impossible to reach. \n- Macro expansions: OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET expands to &tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))]; with the call OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token) this becomes OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&( *token )) i.e. OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token), so the macro usage does not introduce an unreachable path. \n- The OS_DEBUG macro is defined empty; that only removes the debug call at preprocessing time (dead/removed code), but does not create an unreachable branch in the source-level control flow. \n- There are no conditional compilations, placed returns, infinite loops, or other constructs in this snippet that would produce unreachable source code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. \n\nNote: There are other potential concerns (e.g. lack of token validity/index bounds checking, use of mq_close error handling), but these are not instances of unreachable code and thus are outside the scope of Rule 2.1 investigation."
