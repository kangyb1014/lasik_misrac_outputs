  "explanation": "The rule concerns modification of the parameter 'token' (the pointer itself). The function signature and the single use of 'token' in the call to OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET are the only locations that could possibly modify the parameter or the object it refers to. There are no assignments to 'token', no pointer arithmetic on 'token', and no other function calls that receive 'token' directly. The mq_close call and OS_DEBUG do not reference or modify 'token' (they operate on impl->id and logging), and the local variables (return_code, impl) are unrelated to modifying the function parameter. Therefore only the function declaration and the macro call that uses '*token' need investigation to confirm the pointer itself is not being modified (and to inspect the macro expansion of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET for any side-effects)."
