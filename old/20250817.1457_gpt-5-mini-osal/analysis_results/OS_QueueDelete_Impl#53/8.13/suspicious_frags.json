  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not declare or use pointer variables that could/should be const-qualified. Specifically: the function parameter token is already a pointer to a const-qualified type; return_code is a scalar (int32) not a pointer; the return statement and simple assignments (return_code = ...) do not involve pointer types; the OS_DEBUG call and strerror(errno) usage do not introduce pointer declarations in this function (they are expressions/utility calls and any const-qualification of their return types is defined by their own APIs); comments and braces are not relevant. The three reported fragments are the only occurrences in this function where a pointer to a record is obtained/used and thus where const-qualification should be examined."
