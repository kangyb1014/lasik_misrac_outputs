  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function OS_QueueDelete_Impl and the related symbols. There is no use of memcmp anywhere in the target code or in the supplied definitions/macros. The function only calls mq_close and uses errno/strerror for diagnostics; neither of these invokes memcmp nor performs string comparisons. The macros and types shown (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, OS_DEBUG, OS_impl_queue_table, token/type definitions) also do not contain memcmp or any string comparison. Therefore there are no code fragments in the provided input that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings). If you want me to scan additional files or other parts of the codebase, provide those sources and I will search for memcmp usages."
