Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_QueueDelete_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_QueueDelete_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    int32                            return_code;\n    OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_queue_table, *token);\n\n    /* Try to delete and unlink the queue */\n    if (mq_close(impl->id) != 0)\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"OS_QueueDelete Error during mq_close(). errno = %d (%s)\\n\", errno, strerror(errno));\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_QueueDelete_Impl:\n#define OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(tbl, tok) (&tbl[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(tok))])\n...\nstatic inline osal_index_t OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    return token->obj_idx;\n}\n...\nOS_impl_queue_internal_record_t OS_impl_queue_table[OS_MAX_QUEUES]\n...\ntypedef struct\n{\n    mqd_t id;\n} OS_impl_queue_internal_record_t\n...\ntypedef struct OS_object_token OS_object_token_t\n...\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\nint32 OS_QueueDelete(osal_id_t queue_id)\n{\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n    int32             return_code;\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetById(OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, queue_id, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_QueueDelete_Impl(&token);\n\n        /* Complete the operation via the common routine */\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(return_code, &token);\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nOS_DEBUG(\"OS_QueueDelete Error during mq_close(). errno = %d (%s)\\n\", errno, strerror(errno));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The OS_DEBUG macro is defined as empty (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)). Therefore the logging statement (and its arguments) are removed at preprocessing and no operation is executed at runtime. Rule 2.2 applies to executed operations whose removal would not affect behaviour (dead code). Because this statement is not executed, it is not dead code and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
