  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to determine unreachable code per MISRA:\n\n- struct Request (definition)\n  Reason: The function immediately does `struct Request *request = cls; struct Session *session = request->session;`. To decide whether any part of the function is unreachable you must know whether `request` or `request->session` can be NULL or otherwise constrained by the Request definition or its initialization sites. If request->session is guaranteed non-NULL (or always NULL) at call sites, that can make parts of the function unreachable.\n\n- struct Session (definition, including exact types and sizes of sid, value_1, value_2)\n  Reason: The code depends on `sizeof(session->value_1)` and `sizeof(session->value_2)` and writes into those arrays. To determine if the branches checking `off >= sizeof(...) - 1` or `size + off >= sizeof(...)` can ever be true (or are always true/always false) you need the declared sizes and types of those members. Also the type/length of `sid` is needed to reason about the fprintf call. Array sizes and types can make one or more branches statically unreachable.\n\n- All call sites that register or pass post_iterator as a callback (names/locations)\n  Reason: If the static call graph shows no callers (post_iterator is a static function and never referenced), the entire function is unreachable and thus violates the MISRA rule. Conversely, knowing the exact callers and how they pass parameters (what they pass as cls, how they invoke the MHD post processor) is necessary to determine which branches are potentially reachable.\n\n- Declaration/contract of the MHD post-iterator callback (MHD_PostIteratorCallback typedef / microhttpd API documentation)\n  Reason: The runtime/callback contract from libmicrohttpd (or whichever MHD) determines legal/guaranteed ranges and nullability of the callback parameters: whether `key` can be NULL, whether `data` can be NULL, and the allowed ranges/semantics of `off` and `size` (e.g., are they limited to request content length, are they truncated by the caller). These guarantees can make certain strcmp or bounds tests impossible at compile/time-of-analysis, turning code into provably unreachable branches.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and the MHD_YES enumerator definition\n  Reason: While not directly making code unreachable, the enum definition and possible values documented in the library help determine whether all return paths are meaningful and whether any return value is dead/unobservable. Also needed for completeness of the semantic model when reasoning about the callback usage.\n\n(Notes: Standard C library symbols used inside the function\u2014strcmp, memcpy, fprintf, stdout, stderr, and the integer typedefs uint64_t/size_t\u2014are assumed available to the analyzer; they do not by themselves create or eliminate reachability. The important \u2018\u2018close\u2019\u2019 symbols above are those that constrain runtime inputs or establish whether the function is ever invoked.)"
