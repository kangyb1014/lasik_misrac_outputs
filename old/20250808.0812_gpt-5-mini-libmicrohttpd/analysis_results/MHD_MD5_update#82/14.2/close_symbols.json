The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "md5_transform: The target's while loop body calls md5_transform. Any for-loops inside md5_transform itself must be inspected (MISRA's for-loop well-formedness applies to each for and the behaviour of functions called in a for body is part of that for body). Also md5_transform might read/modify objects visible to a surrounding for loop in other contexts. memcpy: Often implemented as a macro or inline routine that can contain loops; if memcpy expands to a for-loop or uses objects modified in an enclosing loop, that affects MISRA assessment. mhd_assert: May be a macro that expands to function-like code (including control flow); if it expands to a for-loop or modifies objects used as loop counters/flags it matters. MD5_BLOCK_SIZE: The numeric value affects loop conditions (e.g., MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length) and is needed to reason whether any loops (explicit or macro-generated) are using or depending on objects that are modified in the loop body. struct Md5Ctx (definition): Must know types of ctx->count, ctx->buffer and ctx->H (and whether any are volatile/shared) because for-loop clauses must not use objects that are modified in the loop body; also to see whether operations on these fields in called functions constitute modifications relevant to MISRA. MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE: Controls conditional compilation of the early return; presence/absence can change control flow and whether code containing loops (or macros that expand differently) is present. __builtin_rotateleft32: A callee of md5_transform; included so the full implementation chain reachable from the loop body can be inspected for any for-loops or side effects that would be relevant to a for-loop well-formedness check."
