  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide if MHD_MD5_update contains dead code:\n\n- struct Md5Ctx\n  - The function reads and writes ctx members; the structure layout (especially types/sizes) is needed to know whether operations (e.g. buffer writes, count updates) can have any effect, whether accesses can be optimized away, or whether certain branches are impossible.\n\n- Md5Ctx::count (field type and width)\n  - The code computes bytes_have = (unsigned int) (ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1)) and then increments ctx->count by length. The exact integer type and width determine wrap behaviour and masking semantics; this affects whether branches (bytes_have != 0) can ever be true and whether the count update is observable \u2014 central to determining if code is dead.\n\n- Md5Ctx::buffer (field type/size)\n  - Buffer type and declared size determine whether the memcpy and md5_transform calls are necessary and whether copying into the buffer has observable effects. If the buffer is unused or overlaps with other state, removal might change behaviour.\n\n- Md5Ctx::H (field type)\n  - md5_transform updates H; the presence, type and use of H determine whether calls to md5_transform (and thus preceding copies) produce observable state changes. This directly affects whether those calls (and the code that leads to them) are dead.\n\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE\n  - Controls the modulus and loop conditions (bytes_have, bytes_left, while loop). Its value determines whether branches/loops can execute; e.g. if MD5_BLOCK_SIZE == 1 some branches collapse, and if it's large relative to typical lengths some loops never run. Required to evaluate reachability/observability of code paths.\n\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  - Preprocessor macro that gates the early return when length == 0. Knowing whether this macro is defined for the build is required to decide if the early-return path exists or if the subsequent code must handle length==0 \u2014 affects whether the initial mhd_assert or subsequent operations could be dead.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The assertion may be a macro that expands to nothing in production or may abort/log on failure. Whether it is active/has side effects changes whether its presence is observable (i.e. not dead) and whether the initial null-check is meaningful.\n\n- md5_transform\n  - The function called to process full blocks; its side effects on ctx->H or other global state determine whether calls to it are necessary. If md5_transform has no side effects (or is a no-op in a given build), calls leading to it could be dead. Its prototype and behaviour are therefore required.\n\n- memcpy\n  - The code performs memcpy into ctx->buffer. If memcpy is replaced, optimized out, or has unusual semantics in the environment, the copy may be unnecessary/observable. Knowledge of memcpy implementation/semantics (or whether it's a macro) is required.\n\n- digest_update (caller) and the other callers: digest_update_str, digest_update_with_colon, calculate_nonce, calc_userdigest, calc_userhash, digest_auth_check_all_inner\n  - To decide if some branches in MHD_MD5_update are never executed in practice (and therefore dead), the call sites must be inspected: e.g. callers may always pass length>0, or always call with aligned buffers such that bytes_have is always zero. The set of callers and their calling patterns/argument ranges are needed to determine whether parts of MHD_MD5_update are unreachable in practice but reachable in code-flow and thus dead.\n\nOverall: these symbols provide the data layout, compile-time configuration, called-function semantics, and calling-context information required to decide whether any executed operations in MHD_MD5_update can be removed without changing program behaviour (the essence of the MISRA dead-code rule)."
