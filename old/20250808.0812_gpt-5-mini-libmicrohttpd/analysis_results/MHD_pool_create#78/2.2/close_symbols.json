  "explanation": "For determining whether any operation in MHD_pool_create is dead code (i.e., executed but removable without changing program behaviour) we must know which operations actually affect program state and control flow and which may be no-ops depending on build/configuration. Each symbol below is necessary for that analysis:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: Defines the fields (memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size). Knowing these field types and how they are used elsewhere is essential to decide if writing them here is required by later code or could be removed.\n\n- new_connection_process_: The caller shown in the static call graph. Inspecting this caller (and other users) is required to see how the returned pool and its fields are consumed; that determines whether initializations in MHD_pool_create are necessary or dead.\n\n- mhd_assert: Assertions may be compiled out in some builds. To judge whether the mhd_assert calls are active (affect behaviour) or dead (no-ops), we need its definition/semantics.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: Typically a debug fill or a no-op in release. If it writes memory that later code depends on (or if it's removed in production), that changes whether the call is dead; its definition is needed.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: Its value affects the conditional that selects mmap/VirtualAlloc vs. fallback malloc and thus which code-paths are executed. A constant value could make branches unconditional (making the other branch dead) so its value is required.\n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS and _WIN32: These conditional-compilation macros determine which code blocks are present in the compiled unit. A branch that is not compiled in is unreachable and not subject to dead-code rules; knowing their definitions/environment is required.\n\n- MAP_FAILED: Used to test the result of mmap/VirtualAlloc. Understanding its value and semantics is required to know whether the fallback malloc path can ever be taken and whether the checks are meaningful.\n\n- mmap: The behavior (return value on success/failure, side effects) and whether it is available in the build affect whether the mmap branch is live or effectively dead.\n\n- VirtualAlloc: As with mmap, its availability/behaviour determines whether the Windows allocation branch is live or dead in a given build.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: Influences the computed alloc_size for the malloc fallback. If this macro is a no-op or fixed to the same value as earlier computation, some assignments may be redundant; its definition is needed.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Used in the alignment assertion. If ALIGN_SIZE == 1 or the assert is compiled out, the assertion may be vacuous/dead. Its value and relation to memory alignment must be known.\n\n- malloc and free: Their semantics and whether they can fail determine control flow (early returns and cleanup). Whether the allocation calls and the subsequent free(pool) on failure affect program behaviour must be checked.\n\nCollectively, these symbols determine which branches are present and executed, which operations have observable side effects, and therefore whether any executed operation could be removed without changing program behaviour (i.e., whether it is dead code)."
