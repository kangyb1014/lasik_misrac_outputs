  "explanation": "To decide whether any portion of MHD_pool_create is unreachable you must know both which branches are compiled and what runtime values/semantics make branches impossible. The listed symbols influence compilation or control-flow and therefore are required: \n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS: compile-time conditional that enables the mmap/VirtualAlloc path; if defined/undefined it makes large blocks of code (the #if branch) either reachable or not.  \n- _WIN32: same as above for selecting the Windows VirtualAlloc branch versus POSIX mmap; affects which branch is compiled.  \n- MAP_FAILED: the code compares pool->memory against MAP_FAILED to choose the fallback malloc path; its definition/value and type determine which branch is taken and whether checks are meaningful.  \n- MHD_sys_page_size_: value used in the runtime test (max < MHD_sys_page_size_ * 4 / 3) and for rounding alloc_size; its value can make the mmap/alloc branch always or never taken.  \n- mmap: POSIX allocator called in the #if branch; its return semantics (MAP_FAILED on failure) are required to know whether the else/fallback path is reachable.  \n- VirtualAlloc: Windows allocator called in the #if _WIN32 branch; its return semantics (NULL on failure) and interaction with pool->memory determine reachability of subsequent branches.  \n- malloc: used to allocate the pool struct and fallback buffer; its failure/return behavior affects early returns and therefore reachability of later code.  \n- free: used on failure path to release pool; needed to verify that the failure branch is actually executed in some scenarios.  \n- mhd_assert: assertion macro/function may abort or be a no-op depending on build; if it aborts or expands to an unreachable marker it can make following code unreachable.  \n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: used to compute alloc_size for the fallback malloc path; its definition affects whether alloc_size can be zero or have other values that influence later assertions/branches.  \n- ALIGN_SIZE: used in the alignment assertion of pool->memory; its value could make that assertion tautologically true/false and thereby affect whether code after the assert is reachable under assertion-terminating builds.  \n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: final action on the allocated memory; whether it is a no-op, traps, or aborts can affect reachability of return.  \n- PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE: flags passed to mmap/VirtualAlloc \u2014 while not directly changing reachability, their presence documents which allocation API is used and helps reasoning about whether the allocation call can succeed/behave as expected.  \n- struct MemoryPool (definition: memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size): you must know the type of pool->memory (pointer vs integer), and whether writing to is_mmap/pos/end/size has side effects or constraints that could make code unreachable (e.g., alignment assertions depend on the type/definition).  \n- uintptr_t: used in the alignment check cast; its width and semantics determine whether the alignment assertion is meaningful and whether subsequent code could be considered unreachable under certain builds.  \n\nWith these symbols you can determine which source lines are included in the build (preprocessor macros), which runtime branches are possible (allocator return values and page-size constant), and whether assertion or poison macros cause control to never reach later statements \u2014 all necessary to assess possible unreachable code (MISRA rule)."
