The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_ip_count_lock as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_ip_count_lock:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_count_lock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_lock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n#else\n  (void) daemon;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_ip_count_lock:\n#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)\n...\n#define MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(pmutex) do{if(!MHD_mutex_lock_(pmutex))MHD_PANIC(_(\"Failed to lock mutex.\\n\"));\\\n}while(0)\n...\n#define MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS 1\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_ip_count_lock code violates the rule 21.17 or not.",

  "scenario": "No violation. The function MHD_ip_count_lock does not call any functions from <string.h> nor perform any string/buffer copies; it only asserts and locks a mutex. A concrete violation scenario (hypothetical) would be if the function (or a called helper) used a string function unsafely, e.g. strcpy(buf, daemon->ip) where buf is smaller than daemon->ip resulting in access beyond the bounds of buf.",
