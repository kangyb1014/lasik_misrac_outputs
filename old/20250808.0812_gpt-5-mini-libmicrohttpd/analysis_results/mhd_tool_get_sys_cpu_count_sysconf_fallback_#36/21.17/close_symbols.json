  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n- sysconf: The function is called from the target code. To prove the target function does not violate the MISRA string-handling rule you must know whether sysconf (or any wrapper used at link time) calls any <string.h> functions or would cause uses of pointer-based string routines that could access out-of-bounds memory.\n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU and _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These platform constants are passed to sysconf; knowing their definitions may be necessary to resolve conditional compilation or platform-specific wrapper behavior (e.g., if a macro expands to a helper that uses string functions).\n- HAVE_SYSCONF, HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU, HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These build-time macros control whether the sysconf calls and branches are compiled. The analysis must know which branches are active to see whether sysconf calls exist in the compiled target and therefore whether any indirect string-handling use could arise.\n- <unistd.h> (declaration of sysconf): The header (and any platform-specific headers it includes) can reveal inline wrappers, macros, or attributes that might pull in other functions or implementations that use string.h functions.\n- string.h and its standard functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn): Although the target function does not directly call these, the MISRA rule concerns use of these functions. Include them to confirm (1) that none are called directly in the target function, and (2) that none are pulled in indirectly by sysconf or by platform headers/wrappers compiled into the same translation unit.\n\nNote: No other internal functions are called directly by the target. If the build configuration shows none of the sysconf branches are compiled in (HAVE_SYSCONF undefined), then the function contains no calls to string.h functions and no further symbols are needed for the MISRA string-rule check."
