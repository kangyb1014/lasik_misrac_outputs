  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to determine whether any code in mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_ is unreachable:\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF: This preprocessor macro controls whether the entire sysconf-based block is compiled in. If it is not defined, all code inside the #if ... #endif is removed at compile time and thus is unreachable by construction. Determining its definition is necessary to decide compile-time (preprocessor) reachability.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU: This preprocessor macro controls whether the branch that calls sysconf(_SC_CRAY_NCPU) is compiled. If not defined, that ifdef block is removed; if defined it enables reachable code. Its presence/absence directly affects which statements exist in the final translation unit.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: Same role as HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU but for the _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF branch. It determines whether the second sysconf call (and its enclosing conditional) is present in the compiled code.\n\n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU: The macro/constant passed to sysconf when the CRAY NCPU declaration is present. Its value isn't needed numerically, but its presence controls whether the associated sysconf call is meaningful; some static analyses treat unknown constants differently, so explicitly knowing this symbol matters for analyzing reachability of the call.\n\n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: As above for the POSIX/GLIBC processors constant. Its presence (or absence) affects whether that sysconf call is a valid compile-time branch and thus whether the code invoking it can be reached.\n\n- sysconf (function): The runtime semantics of sysconf (prototype and documented return values) are required to reason about runtime reachability of subsequent branches. For example, the code tests value after sysconf: sysconf can return -1 on error and positive counts on success; knowing this is necessary to decide whether later conditionals (the second if (0 >= value), the overflow check and the return -1; branches) can ever be executed at runtime.\n\n- INT_MAX: The overflow check casts value to int and then back to long to detect overflow: if ((long) ret != value) return -1. To determine whether that return is reachable, the limits of int (INT_MAX/INT_MIN) are needed to see whether some plausible sysconf return values could trigger the overflow branch.\n\n- LONG_MAX: Knowledge of the long range (and relationship between LONG_MAX and INT_MAX) is needed to reason about possible values returned by sysconf and whether the conversion to int can change the value (thus whether the overflow return is reachable).\n\nNote: The main reachability questions are resolved by the compile-time macros (HAVE_SYSCONF, HAS_DECL_*). The runtime-path reachability (e.g., whether the second sysconf call is skipped or the overflow-return is reachable) requires sysconf semantics and the integer limits (INT_MAX/LONG_MAX) so an analyzer can determine whether any execution path can reach those statements."
