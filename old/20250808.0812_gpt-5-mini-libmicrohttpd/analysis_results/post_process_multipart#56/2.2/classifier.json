  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified post_process_multipart code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/450.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of post_process_multipart as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of post_process_multipart:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\npost_process_multipart (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp,\n                        const char *post_data,\n                        size_t post_data_len)\n{\n  char *buf;\n  size_t max;\n  size_t ioff;\n  size_t poff;\n  int state_changed;\n\n  buf = (char *) &pp[1];\n  ioff = 0;\n  poff = 0;\n  state_changed = 1;\n  while ( (poff < post_data_len) ||\n          ( (pp->buffer_pos > 0) &&\n            (0 != state_changed) ) )\n  {\n    /* first, move as much input data\n       as possible to our internal buffer */\n    max = pp->buffer_size - pp->buffer_pos;\n    if (max > post_data_len - poff)\n      max = post_data_len - poff;\n    memcpy (&buf[pp->buffer_pos],\n            &post_data[poff],\n            max);\n    poff += max;\n    pp->buffer_pos += max;\n    if ( (0 == max) &&\n         (0 == state_changed) &&\n         (poff < post_data_len) )\n    {\n      pp->state = PP_Error;\n      return MHD_NO;            /* out of memory */\n    }\n    state_changed = 0;\n\n    /* first state machine for '\\r'-'\\n' and '--' handling */\n    switch (pp->skip_rn)\n    {\n    case RN_Inactive:\n      break;\n    case RN_OptN:\n      if (buf[0] == '\\n')\n      {\n        ioff++;\n        pp->skip_rn = RN_Inactive;\n        goto AGAIN;\n      }\n    /* fall-through! */\n    case RN_Dash:\n      if (buf[0] == '-')\n      {\n        ioff++;\n        pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash2;\n        goto AGAIN;\n      }\n      pp->skip_rn = RN_Full;\n    /* fall-through! */\n    case RN_Full:\n      if (buf[0] == '\\r')\n      {\n        if ( (pp->buffer_pos > 1) &&\n             ('\\n' == buf[1]) )\n        {\n          pp->skip_rn = RN_Inactive;\n          ioff += 2;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n          pp->skip_rn = RN_OptN;\n          ioff++;\n        }\n        goto AGAIN;\n      }\n      if (buf[0] == '\\n')\n      {\n        ioff++;\n        pp->skip_rn = RN_Inactive;\n        goto AGAIN;\n      }\n      pp->skip_rn = RN_Inactive;\n      pp->state = PP_Error;\n      return MHD_NO;            /* no '\\r\\n' */\n    case RN_Dash2:\n      if (buf[0] == '-')\n      {\n        ioff++;\n        pp->skip_rn = RN_Full;\n        pp->state = pp->dash_state;\n        goto AGAIN;\n      }\n      pp->state = PP_Error;\n      break;\n    }\n\n    /* main state engine */\n    switch (pp->state)\n    {\n    case PP_Error:\n      return MHD_NO;\n    case PP_Done:\n      /* did not expect to receive more data */\n      pp->state = PP_Error;\n      return MHD_NO;\n    case PP_Init:\n      /**\n       * Per RFC2046 5.1.1 NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS, consume anything\n       * prior to the first multipart boundary:\n       *\n       * > There appears to be room for additional information prior\n       * > to the first boundary delimiter line and following the\n       * > final boundary delimiter line.
