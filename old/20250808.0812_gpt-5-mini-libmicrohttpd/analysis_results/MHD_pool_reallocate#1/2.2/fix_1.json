  "explanation": "I made the translation unit self-contained by adding minimal supporting definitions that the function expects but which were missing: the MemoryPool struct, alignment and red-zone constants, helper functions for rounding and pointer arithmetic, simple (no-op) poison/unpoison functions, and an mhd_assert implementation. I avoided using macros as requested and preserved the original MHD_pool_reallocate logic and control flow nearly verbatim. These additions allow the code to compile successfully while keeping the function behavior intact."
