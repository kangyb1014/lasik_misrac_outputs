The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking MISRA 'well-formed for loop' rule we need only the symbols that appear in or could be macro-expanded into the target function's expressions (to ensure no hidden for-statements or side-effects). Explanations: 1) WS_UPGRADE_VALUE \u2014 this macro/constant is compared with upg_header; its definition must be inspected to ensure it is a simple string constant and not a macro that expands to code (especially any for statements or side-effecting expressions). 2) strcmp \u2014 standard library function could be implemented as a macro or inline; confirm whether it is a plain function (no macro expansion introducing for loops or side effects) and that it does not change objects used in the target expression. 3) strstr \u2014 same rationale as strcmp: ensure it is not a macro/inline expansion that injects for-statements or side effects into the target function. 4) MHD_YES \u2014 return value/name (likely macro/enum constant); inspect to ensure it is a simple constant and not a macro that expands into code with loops or side effects. 5) MHD_NO \u2014 same as MHD_YES. 6) enum MHD_Result \u2014 the result type definition confirms the underlying type and that returning MHD_YES/MHD_NO is a simple value return (no hidden control flow or macros). 7) struct MHD_Connection \u2014 parameter type: check its declaration only to ensure that the (void) con cast is valid and that the type introduces no surprising macro/inline behaviour. 8) NULL \u2014 ensure NULL is the standard macro/constant and not redefined to something that could expand to code with loops/side-effects. Together these symbols let the next analyst verify there are no hidden for-statements or persistent side-effects introduced by macros or inline expansions in the expressions of is_websocket_request; since the function body contains no explicit for loop, the only risk to MISRA compliance would be from such expansions or non-trivial macro returns."
