  "explanation": "- strcmp: The function calls strcmp directly. To decide if the code violates the MISRA prohibition on using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings we must know whether strcmp is a plain library call or is (in this build/implementation) implemented by delegating to memcmp. If strcmp is implemented in terms of memcmp then the call could indirectly use memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings.\n- strstr: The function also calls strstr. Although strstr is not normally used to compare whole null\u2011terminated strings, some library implementations may call memcmp internally. Obtain strstr\u2019s implementation/declaration to check for any use of memcmp.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule specifically forbids use of memcmp for null\u2011terminated strings. We need the memcmp symbol (or its implementation) to determine whether it is invoked directly in this translation unit or indirectly by strcmp/strstr (or by any macro alias) when operating on the arguments in this function.\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: This symbol is compared via strcmp. We must know its type and definition (string literal, char array, or something else) to confirm that the comparison is between null\u2011terminated strings (which is what the MISRA rule targets)."
