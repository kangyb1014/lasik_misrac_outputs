  "explanation": "- ahc_cb: the only caller of is_websocket_request per the call graph. To determine whether any branch of is_websocket_request can ever be executed (i.e. whether its parameters can take values that make the conditional true/false), we must inspect ahc_cb to see what arguments it passes (possibly constant or always-NULL values). If ahc_cb always passes values that force a single return, parts of is_websocket_request could be unreachable.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value and MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: ahc_cb calls these functions to obtain header values in typical implementations. We need their behavior/contract (when they return NULL vs non-NULL and what pointer values they may return) to determine whether upg_header and con_header passed into is_websocket_request can ever be non-NULL or contain the expected strings; this affects reachability of the true/false branches.\n\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: the constant string used in the strcmp comparison. If this macro/constant is defined in a way that makes the strcmp comparison always true or always false (e.g. identical to a value always produced by the caller, or impossible), parts of the conditional become unreachable. Its exact definition is required.\n\n- strcmp and strstr: although standard library functions, their semantics are needed to reason about the comparisons: strcmp(...) == 0 and strstr(..., \"Upgrade\") != NULL. Understanding that these behave as string equality and substring search is required to conclude whether certain conditional outcomes are possible.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES / MHD_NO): the return values used by the function. While the enum values themselves do not affect reachability of code within the function, their definitions help determine whether any higher-level logic treats one return value as impossible/unused; include to allow a full, end-to-end analysis of whether certain return paths are effectively unreachable in the project context.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst determine whether any branch or return in is_websocket_request can never be taken (and therefore would violate the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code)."
