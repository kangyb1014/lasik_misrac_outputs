  "explanation": "For deciding if any code in mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_ is dead, the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY: Preprocessor guard that controls whether the large body of the function is compiled at all. If undefined the code sections are omitted -> affects dead-code status.\n- HAVE_CPU_COUNT: Controls use of the CPU_COUNT branch; determines whether the CPU_COUNT-based code is present/used.\n- HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S: Controls inclusion of the CPU_COUNT_S / dynamic-allocation branch; affects presence of that alternative path.\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: Alters how CPU_COUNT_S is called (parameter is count vs. size); changes which code path/expr is active.\n- cpuset_getaffinity: External function called to populate masks; its existence, signature and return semantics (0 on success) determine whether inner branches execute.\n- cpuset_t: Type of the mask used; needed to know size/alignment and whether sizeof(cur_mask) is appropriate (affects which code is meaningful/compiled).\n- CPU_LEVEL_WHICH, CPU_WHICH_PID, id_t: Constants/type passed to cpuset_getaffinity; their values or semantics can affect whether call succeeds/behaves, and thus whether subsequent code executes.\n- CPU_COUNT: Macro/function used to count CPUs in cur_mask in one branch; needed to know if that call is present and its return behaviour (e.g. can return 0) for dead-code determination.\n- CPU_COUNT_S: Variant that counts in dynamically allocated masks; required to know which overload is called and whether it can produce useful (nonzero) results.\n- CPU_ALLOC, CPU_FREE, CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: APIs/macros used to allocate and free the dynamic mask and compute mask_size_bytes; required to determine if allocation path is viable or compiled-out.\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE, CPU_SETSIZE: Constants used for the fixed-size loop and for mask sizing; they determine loop bounds and whether the sizeof-based or scaled allocation path is reachable.\n- CPU_ISSET: Used in the fallback counting loop; needed to know its semantics (which bits it tests) and thus whether the loop can yield nonzero ret.\n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count: The immediate caller (static in TU). Since the function is static, determining dead code at project level requires checking this caller to see if the function is ever invoked.\n- detect_cpu_core_count, detect_process_cpu_core_count, mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count: Upstream callers shown in the call graph. To conclude whether the function is dead in the project you must confirm whether these callers (or any call chain to this function) are compiled/used.\n\nIn summary: preprocessor macros determine which code is present; the cpuset APIs, types and CPU_* macros determine whether the runtime paths can execute and produce effects; and the caller symbols determine reachability from the rest of the project. All are required to decide if removing any operation in this function would not affect program behaviour (i.e. is dead code)."
