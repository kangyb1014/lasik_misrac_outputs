  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA 'use const where possible' analysis:\n\n1) struct z_stream (zlib) - full definition\n   - Required to know the exact types and const-qualification of the members next_in and next_out (and avail_in/avail_out). The key question is whether next_in and next_out are declared as const Bytef * or Bytef *; assigning a const-qualified pointer (from src) to a non-const field (or vice versa) can violate the rule. Also needed to know whether z_stream fields are modified by deflate and whether they imply modification of the pointed-to buffers.\n\n2) deflate (prototype)\n   - Required to determine whether deflate() may modify the memory pointed to by next_in and next_out (semantically and via its prototype/contract). If deflate writes to the buffer pointed by next_out (tmp) then tmp must not be const; if deflate only reads from next_in then next_in could be const. The prototype/semantics clarify whether passing a const-qualified buffer would be appropriate.\n\n3) Bytef (typedef)\n   - The code casts src to (const Bytef *). Knowing what Bytef actually aliases (typically unsigned char) and whether the API expects Bytef or const Bytef is necessary to judge whether the cast drops or adds const-qualification incorrectly.\n\n4) uInt (typedef)\n   - Used for avail_in/avail_out types; included because differences in typedefs (signed/unsigned/const) can affect whether implicit conversions discard constness; needed to fully understand z_stream member types when checking pointer const correctness.\n\n5) memcpy (prototype)\n   - memcpy signature (void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n)) shows that memcpy treats its source as const. The function passes tmp as memcpy's src after deflate wrote into tmp: to check const-correctness we must reconcile that tmp is both used as a write target (by deflate) and as a read source for memcpy; this proves tmp must be non-const in this context.\n\n6) realloc (prototype)\n   - realloc operates on and returns void *; needed to confirm the semantics of realloc(*dest, *dest_size) and whether const qualification on *dest would be violated by passing it to realloc or by storing realloc's result into *dest. This determines whether dest (and the memory it points to) can be const-qualified.\n\n7) free (prototype)\n   - free takes void *; included to verify that freeing *dest (when realloc fails) requires that the pointer not be const-qualified (you cannot pass const void * to free without discarding const). This affects whether dest (the buffer pointer) may be const.\n\n(Notes: CHUNK/Z_* constants and enum MHD_Result values are not needed for const-qualification analysis. The caller read_cb signature is unnecessary because compress_buf's parameter types and the z_stream/deflate prototypes determine whether pointers passed into zlib fields need const qualification.)"
