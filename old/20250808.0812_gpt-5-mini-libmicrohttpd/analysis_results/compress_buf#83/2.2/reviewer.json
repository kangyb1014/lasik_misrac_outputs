  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is not sufficiently supported. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is a project\u2011level prohibition on dead code \u2014 an executed operation is dead only if its removal cannot affect the program behaviour anywhere in the project. The reporter\u2019s argument relies on a single shown caller that (allegedly) passes a local offset that is not used after the call. That is a local observation, not a whole\u2011project proof. The write *offset += strm->avail_in modifies memory visible to the caller via the pointer parameter; removing that write could change behaviour for other callers or configurations that do inspect the updated value after the call. The test harness failing to compile does not demonstrate that the write is unobserved in the complete project. Therefore the claim that the update is dead code is not proven and the report is not correct."
