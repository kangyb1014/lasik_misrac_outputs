Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for the MISRA-C 'for loop shall be well-formed' analysis:\n\n- read_cb\n  - compress_buf is called from read_cb (call graph shows read_cb -> compress_buf). MISRA's rule requires that the behaviour of a for-loop body include the behaviour of any functions called within that body. To decide if compress_buf can cause a for-loop violation you must know whether read_cb calls compress_buf from inside a for statement and whether the arguments passed (offset, dest, dest_size, tmp or any object reachable from them) are used as the loop counter or loop-control flags in that for loop.\n\n- CHUNK (macro)\n  - CHUNK controls the size of the internal loops/iterations inside compress_buf. If read_cb uses CHUNK-related objects for loop control, or if CHUNK expands to a complex expression/macros that could affect loop formation, you must inspect it. Also useful to reason about boundedness of repeated operations when considering side-effects on loop-control objects.\n\n- struct z_stream and its members (avail_in, avail_out, next_in, next_out)\n  - compress_buf reads/writes z_stream members. If a caller's for-loop condition or loop counter depends on objects that alias these members, or if read_cb passes a z_stream member as the loop counter, those modifications (done inside compress_buf) would be relevant to clause (2)/(3) of the MISRA rule. You need the struct layout and semantics to determine aliasing and which objects are modified.\n\n- Bytef, uInt typedefs\n  - These types appear in zlib API use; knowing whether they are aliases to other integral types (and their side-effect/aliasing properties) is necessary to reason about whether modifications affect loop counters or persistent objects used in for clauses.\n\n- Z_OK, Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH (zlib constants)\n  - These constants determine control flow in compress_buf (e.g. the terminating condition flush != Z_SYNC_FLUSH). If a caller's for-loop uses these same flags/objects for control, or if control-flow depends on them, they must be known to reason about modifications and loop termination semantics.\n\n- deflate() prototype/semantics\n  - deflate() is called inside compress_buf. If compress_buf is invoked from a for-loop body, MISRA requires the body\u2019s behaviour include the behaviour of called functions. You must know whether deflate() has side-effects on objects that might be used as loop counters in the caller, or whether it performs actions that could be considered modification of loop-control objects.\n\n- realloc(), free(), memcpy() prototypes/semantics\n  - compress_buf calls realloc/free/memcpy and modifies *dest and *dest_size. If read_cb's for-loop uses any of those objects (or aliases) as the loop counter or in the for-clause expressions, those calls are relevant to clauses (2)-(4) (objects modified in the loop body). You need their semantics to determine whether the loop counter or other loop-control objects are being modified by compress_buf.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and values MHD_YES / MHD_NO\n  - The return value is used to report success/failure; if a caller's for-loop condition or counter depends on compress_buf return or the MHD_Result, you must know these values to reason about the loop behaviour and potential side-effects.\n\nSummary: the most critical additional symbol to inspect is read_cb (the caller) to determine whether compress_buf is invoked inside a for loop and whether any objects passed to compress_buf are the loop counter/control flag. The remaining symbols (CHUNK, z_stream and its types/constants, and the prototypes of deflate/realloc/free/memcpy and MHD_Result) are required to reason about what compress_buf modifies and whether those modifications affect loop counters or control flags required by MISRA clauses (2)-(4)."
