The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry:\n```c\nstatic bool\ncalculate_add_nonce_with_retry (struct MHD_Connection *const connection,\n                                const char *realm,\n                                struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n                                char *nonce)\n{\n  const uint64_t timestamp1 = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\n  const size_t realm_len = strlen (realm);\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (0 == MHD_get_master (connection->daemon)->digest_auth_rand_size)\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Random value was not initialised by \" \\\n                 \"MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_RANDOM or \" \\\n                 \"MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_RANDOM_COPY, generated nonces \" \\\n                 \"are predictable.\\n\"));\n#endif\n\n  if (! calculate_add_nonce (connection, timestamp1, realm, realm_len, da,\n                             nonce))\n  {\n    /* Either:\n     * 1.
