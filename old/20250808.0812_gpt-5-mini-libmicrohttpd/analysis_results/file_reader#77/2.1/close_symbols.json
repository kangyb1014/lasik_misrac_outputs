  "explanation": "To decide whether any part of file_reader is unreachable you must know which conditional compilation and value tests actually apply and whether the runtime checks can ever be true. The required symbols are:\n\n- struct MHD_Response (fields: fd, fd_off): needed to know the types and ranges of response->fd and response->fd_off (signed vs unsigned, width). This directly affects whether offset64 = (int64_t)(pos + response->fd_off) can be negative and whether uses of fd are valid.\n- _WIN32 and __CYGWIN__: determine which top-level branch (POSIX vs Windows) is compiled; whole branches become unreachable depending on these macros.\n- HAVE_PREAD64, HAVE_PREAD, HAVE_LSEEK64: these compile-time feature macros select which I/O implementation is compiled. Code inside the non-selected #if blocks is unreachable if those macros are not defined.\n- off_t (type and sizeof(off_t)): the code tests sizeof(off_t) < sizeof(uint64_t) in #if/if expressions; that compile-time/implementation property determines whether some checks/branches (seek vs error) are taken or are impossible.\n- ssize_t and SSIZE_MAX: used for the return type and the clamp of max; knowledge of SSIZE_MAX is required to see whether the clamp path and related branches are meaningful or dead.\n- INT32_MAX: used in comparisons that may cause an early return; its value matters when combined with sizeof(off_t) and offset64 to establish reachability of those error returns.\n- pread64, pread, read, lseek64, lseek: presence/availability and signatures indicate which calls are actually used; combined with the HAVE_* macros these determine which call-sites are compiled and thus whether surrounding code is reachable.\n- _get_osfhandle, HANDLE, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, ReadFile, OVERLAPPED, ULARGE_INTEGER: required to analyse the Windows branch \u2014 whether fh check and ReadFile usage are reachable and whether the fh == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE check can ever be evaluated. If _WIN32 is not defined, all of these become irrelevant/unreachable.\n- MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR and MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM: symbolic return values used at many return points; while their numerical values are not required to see reachability, they mark control-flow exit points and help determine whether code after them is unreachable.\n\nWith these symbols you can determine: which #if/#else blocks are actually compiled, whether sizeof/off_t and integer-limit tests are true or false on the target platform, whether offset64 can be negative at runtime (making the initial error-return reachable), and whether specific API call paths (pread vs seek+read vs Windows ReadFile) are compiled/possible. That information is necessary and sufficient to decide whether any statements in file_reader are statically or effectively unreachable per MISRA C (e.g. dead #if branches, impossible runtime conditionals, or always-taken early returns)."
