  "explanation": "Agent A misinterprets MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2. The rule (and its notes) defines dead code as operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour; it explicitly distinguishes unreachable code from dead code (note 2). Code excluded by preprocessor conditionals (e.g. the #elif/#else branches not selected in a given build) is not present in the produced binary for that configuration and therefore is not executed; such excluded source is not \"dead code\" under the quoted MISRA definition. Moreover, the alternative branches can be selected in other build configurations (they are conditional, not inherently redundant). The test/probe attempt failing to compile does not change this semantic point. Therefore the report that this file_reader code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 for the described configuration is not correct."
