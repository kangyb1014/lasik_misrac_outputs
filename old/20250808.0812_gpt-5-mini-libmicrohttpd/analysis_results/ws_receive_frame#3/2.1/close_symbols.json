  "explanation": "To decide whether any branch in ws_receive_frame is statically unreachable you need the following symbols:\n\n- WS_FIN: The first if/else-if comparisons use (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_*). Knowing WS_FIN's value (bit positions and mask) is necessary to determine whether those comparisons can ever be true or whether they collapse to constant/identical values, which could make branches unreachable.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME: Required to evaluate the expression (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME). If this macro is a compile-time constant, its value (and relation to other opcode constants) determines whether the text-frame branch can be taken.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: Required to evaluate (WS_FIN | WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME) and to determine mutual exclusivity/overlap with the text-frame value. If these two composed constants are identical or one subsumes the other the else-if/else structure may contain unreachable code.\n\n- malloc: The function contains a conditional block guarded by the result of malloc (if (NULL != msg)). If malloc is replaced/overridden in the project (for example by a stub that always returns NULL) that block would be unreachable. Knowing the actual implementation/definition of malloc in the build is necessary to judge reachability of the allocation-success path.\n\n- run_usock: This function is the caller (per the call graph). To determine realistic possible values for frame[0], frame[1] and *length (and therefore which branches are actually reachable at runtime in the project), the caller(s) must be inspected. run_usock likely constructs or forwards WebSocket frames; its code/logic will show which frame values are produced and thus whether particular branches in ws_receive_frame are ever exercised.\n\n(Other items such as type definitions for ssize_t/size_t or the runtime contents of the frame buffer are data-level inputs rather than symbols; their actual values come from the caller(s) such as run_usock.)"
