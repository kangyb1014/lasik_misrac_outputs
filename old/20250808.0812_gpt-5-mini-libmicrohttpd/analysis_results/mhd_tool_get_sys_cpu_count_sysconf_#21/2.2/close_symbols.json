  "explanation": "For determining whether the code in mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_ is dead code (removal would not affect program behaviour) you must know both the compile-time inclusion conditions and the run-time call graph and how results are used. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF: The outer #if controlling whether the sysconf-based block is even compiled. If this macro is undefined the whole body is omitted at compile time, so the code cannot be dead at runtime; conversely, if defined it enables further analysis.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN / HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN: These macros control which sysconf name(s) are tried inside the function. Their definitions determine whether any sysconf() calls are present; if both are undefined the block compiles to nothing. Needed to decide if the sysconf code is actually present.\n\n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN / _SC_NPROC_ONLN: The constants passed to sysconf. Their availability/semantics can affect whether sysconf is actually callable and whether the code path executes as intended (some ports may not define them).\n\n- sysconf: The external function called. You must know whether sysconf is available, its side effects, and its return behaviour on the target platform (including error values) to judge whether the sysconf call and the surrounding checks are meaningful or could be removed without effect.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count: This function is the direct caller of the target. To decide whether removing or altering mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_ would change program behaviour you must inspect the caller\u2019s selection logic (which backend implementation it invokes) and how it uses returned values.\n\n- detect_cpu_core_count: A higher-level caller (per static call graph). Including callers up the chain is necessary to establish whether mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count (and therefore the target) is reachable from program entry points and whether its return value affects observable behaviour.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_, mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_: These sibling/back-up implementations are invoked (or considered) by mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count. You must inspect the selection/prioritization logic among these alternatives to know under which build-time or run-time conditions the sysconf variant is chosen. If some other backend is always selected (or sysconf variant is never selected given build/runtime config), the sysconf implementation could be dead.\n\nIn short: macros and sysconf determine whether the target's body exists and what it does; the caller(s) and sibling implementations determine whether that code is ever invoked or whether its removal would change program behaviour. Analyzing these symbols is sufficient to decide if the target contains dead code under the MISRA rule."
