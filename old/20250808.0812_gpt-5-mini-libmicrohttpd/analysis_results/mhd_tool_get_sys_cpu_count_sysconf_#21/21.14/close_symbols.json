  "explanation": "To decide whether this function violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings you must know whether any memcmp usage can appear in the compiled function after preprocessing/inlining. The required symbols and why:\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF: controls whether the sysconf-based block is compiled at all. If the block is not compiled the function contains no calls/macros that could hide memcmp; if it is compiled we must inspect the block.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN and HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN: each controls whether a particular sysconf call is compiled into this function. Different combinations change which identifiers/macros are present and thus change what needs inspection for hidden memcmp usage.\n\n- sysconf: the function (or macro) invoked inside the block. You must examine its declaration/definition (or macro expansion) to ensure it does not expand or inline to code that uses memcmp (or call an inline wrapper that does). Although typical sysconf is not memcmp-related, sysconf could be a macro or wrapper in the build environment, so its definition must be checked.\n\n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN and _SC_NPROC_ONLN: these constants/macros appear in the code; if they are macros that expand to expressions or wrapper calls they could introduce unexpected code. Verify they are simple integer constants and not macros that expand to code that uses memcmp.\n\n- <unistd.h>: header that commonly provides sysconf and the _SC_* symbols. Inspecting the header as used in the build ensures that none of the above identifiers are macro-wrapped or implemented in a way that introduces memcmp.\n\nNotes: The function source shown contains no direct use of memcmp. The only possible ways memcmp could appear in the compiled body are (a) through macro expansion of identifiers used in the function, or (b) inside the implementation/inline/wrapper of sysconf. The listed symbols are sufficient to check those possibilities. If you also want to be conservative, include any platform-specific wrapper headers or inline implementations that the build uses for sysconf."
