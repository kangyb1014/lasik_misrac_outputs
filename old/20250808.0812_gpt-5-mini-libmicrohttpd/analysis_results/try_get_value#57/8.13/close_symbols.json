  "explanation": "Provide the declarations/signatures (or source) for these symbols because they affect whether the pointer types in try_get_value should be const-qualified:\n\n- strlen: prototype shows it takes a const char * and returns size_t. Knowing it does not modify its argument helps determine whether spos/bpos/endv are const and whether source data are treated as const.\n\n- strstr: prototype (const char *, const char *) -> char * / const char * (implementation-dependent). The exact signature used in the build determines whether the returned pointer is const-qualified; that affects whether spos is effectively a const char * or char * for const-correctness analysis.\n\n- strchr: same reason as strstr \u2014 its prototype (const char *, int) -> char * / const char * determines const qualification of endv and whether operations on the pointed-to characters are modifying const data.\n\n- malloc: prototype (size_t) -> void *. The allocation returns a modifiable block; this shows that *destination is assigned a fresh, modifiable buffer (so the pointee type should be non-const if the function writes into it).\n\n- memcpy: prototype (void *dest, const void *src, size_t n). This shows that the function writes into the buffer pointed to by *destination (dest is non-const), confirming the function modifies the pointee through the pointer stored in *destination.\n\n- size_t: the integer type used for lengths and the malloc parameter; required to interpret buffer sizes and the malloc call.\n\n- NULL: the macro used in pointer tests and returns; needed to understand the null-check logic for *destination and for allocation/lookup failures.\n\n- process_multipart_headers: the caller that passes the destination argument into try_get_value. Its declaration/source is required to see how try_get_value's destination parameter is created and used by the caller (e.g., whether the caller passes a pointer to a const char * or to a char *, whether the same pointee is later modified elsewhere, or whether try_get_value's assignment could violate const qualification expected by the caller).\n\nIn short: the standard string/memory and allocation function prototypes show try_get_value writes into the allocated buffer (so the pointee must be non-const), while the caller's signature/usage is required to verify the pointer-to-pointer passed in does not require a const-qualified target in its API. These symbols are sufficient to decide whether try_get_value violates the MISRA guidance about pointing to const-qualified types."
