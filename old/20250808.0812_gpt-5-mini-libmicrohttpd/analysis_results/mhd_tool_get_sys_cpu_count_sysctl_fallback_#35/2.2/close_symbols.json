  "explanation": "For checking whether the function contains dead code we must know which code is actually compiled, whether the sysctl calls have side effects, and whether the function is ever reached or is redundant compared with other CPU-count providers:\n\n- __linux__: Preprocessor macro that removes the entire sysctl blocks on Linux. Required to determine which portions of the function are present in the build (if excluded by the preprocessor they are not part of the project code and cannot be dead code).\n\n- HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME: Controls inclusion of the sysctlbyname branch. Needed to know if that block is compiled into the function.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCTL: Controls inclusion of the sysctl(MIB) branch. Needed to know if that block is compiled into the function.\n\n- HAS_DECL_CTL_HW: Combined with HAVE_SYSCTL to decide whether the CTL_HW-based sysctl block is compiled; affects presence of code.\n\n- HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU: Same as above; determines inclusion of the HW_NCPU-based sysctl code.\n\n- sysctlbyname: The function called inside one conditional block. We need its declaration/semantics to assess whether calling it produces observable side effects (so its removal would change behaviour) or only sets the local 'ret'. This affects whether that call is dead code.\n\n- sysctl: Same reasoning as sysctlbyname: if sysctl has observable side effects beyond assigning ret (or can fail/affect globals), removing the call could change behaviour.\n\n- CTL_HW: Constant used to build the mib[] for sysctl. Presence/definition matters for compilation of that branch; needed to determine if that code exists.\n\n- HW_NCPU: Same as CTL_HW \u2014 used in the mib initializer; needed to confirm whether the block is compiled and meaningful.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count: The caller of the target function. Its implementation is required to determine the conditions under which the fallback is invoked (e.g. call order, short-circuiting, whether this fallback is ever reached), which is essential to judge if the fallback code is truly executed and whether it could be removed without affecting program behaviour.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_: One of the alternative CPU-count providers invoked by mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count. Needed to see whether it always succeeds such that the fallback is never executed (which would make the fallback dead code).\n\n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_: Another alternative provider. If this always succeeds on targets where the fallback would be compiled, the fallback may be dead; include to compare behaviour and call order.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_: Another alternative provider. Same reason: to establish reachability and redundancy of the fallback.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count: Likewise, to see whether other methods preclude the fallback.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_: Another fallback in the family \u2014 required to understand the overall selection logic for CPU-count methods and whether this particular fallback is ever needed.\n\n- detect_cpu_core_count: Top-level caller of mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count. Its usage patterns (when it calls, expected timing and side effects) are relevant for determining whether removing the target function changes observable system behaviour (note 1 of MISRA: timing may matter).\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyzer determine (1) which parts of the function are actually present in the compiled project (preprocessor symbols and declarations), (2) whether the sysctl/sysctlbyname calls have external side-effects so their removal would change behaviour, and (3) whether the function is ever invoked or whether other providers always succeed making this fallback redundant (dead) in the whole project."
