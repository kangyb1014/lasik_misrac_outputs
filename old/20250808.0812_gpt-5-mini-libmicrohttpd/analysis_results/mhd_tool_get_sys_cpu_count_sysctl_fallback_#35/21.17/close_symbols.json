  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for analyzing the target function with respect to the MISRA C string-handling rule:\n\n- sysctlbyname: The function is called with a string literal name and an output buffer/size pair. Its prototype and semantics are needed to determine whether any string-handling or buffer/length copying occurs internally or if the parameters (pointer + size) could cause out-of-bounds accesses. Even though sysctlbyname is not in <string.h>, it may internally use string functions or copy into the provided buffer.\n\n- sysctl: The lower-level sysctl call is used with a pid-like mib array and an output buffer/size. Its declaration and behavior are required to verify that the value_size / &ret usage is correct and that no implicit string operations (or copying) could violate bounds.\n\n- CTL_HW: Macro used to build the mib[] passed to sysctl. Knowing its type/value is needed to confirm the mib array construction is correct and to rule out any unexpected pointer/size semantics that could lead to buffer misuse in the sysctl call.\n\n- HW_NCPU: Same reason as CTL_HW: part of the mib[] passed to sysctl; needed to fully understand sysctl usage.\n\n- __linux__: Preprocessor guard that excludes the whole block on Linux. The analysis must know whether the code is compiled on the target platform; if excluded, the code paths that use sysctl/sysctlbyname are not relevant for the MISRA check.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME: Build-time macro controlling inclusion of the sysctlbyname branch. Required to know whether that branch is present for the actual build being analyzed.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCTL: Build-time macro controlling inclusion of the sysctl branch. Required to know whether that branch is present for the actual build being analyzed.\n\n- HAS_DECL_CTL_HW: Build-time macro used to guard the sysctl branch; needed to decide whether the CTL_HW/HW_NCPU sysctl path is compiled in.\n\n- HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU: Same as above; required to determine presence of the sysctl mib path.\n\n- size_t: The type of value_size. Knowing its definition (width/representation) is needed to check size comparisons and to ensure the sizeof(ret) fits and is compared correctly, which is relevant to buffer-length correctness and potential out-of-bounds issues.\n\n- NULL: Used as the pointer argument in the sysctl/sysctlbyname calls; knowing its definition is trivial but included so the analyzer can reason about the pointer arguments passed.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule in question targets standard <string.h> functions, but this function does not directly call those. To determine if any string-handling violations could still occur (either via internal implementation of sysctl/sysctlbyname or via misuse of buffer/size parameters that could lead to out-of-bounds memory accesses), the analyzer must know the exact prototypes/semantics of sysctlbyname and sysctl, the compile-time guards that enable/disable the code, and the types/macros that affect buffer sizes and parameters. These listed symbols provide the necessary context to decide whether a string/buffer bounds violation is possible."
