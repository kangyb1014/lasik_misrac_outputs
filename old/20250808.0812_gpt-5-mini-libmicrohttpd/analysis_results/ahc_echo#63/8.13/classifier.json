  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified ahc_echo code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/507.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of ahc_echo as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ahc_echo:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nahc_echo (void *cls,\n          struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n          const char *url,\n          const char *method,\n          const char *version,\n          const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size, void **req_cls)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  /* Only one user has access to the page */\n  static const char *username = \"testuser\";\n  static const char *password = \"testpass\";\n  static const char *realm = \"test@example.com\";\n  enum MHD_DigestAuthResult res_e;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  static int already_called_marker;\n  (void) cls;               /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. All pointers to character data that are not modified are declared as pointers to const (e.g. url, method, version, upload_data, username, password, realm). Pointers used to modify the pointed object (e.g. req_cls is void ** and the function stores a marker address into *req_cls, and response/connection objects are non-const because they are passed to API functions that mutate or destroy them) are non-const as required. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
