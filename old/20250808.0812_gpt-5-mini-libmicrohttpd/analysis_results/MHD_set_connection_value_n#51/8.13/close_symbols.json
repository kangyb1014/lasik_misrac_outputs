  "explanation": "To determine whether MHD_set_connection_value_n violates the MISRA rule on const-correctness we must know what the callee does with the pointer arguments and whether the connection object is modified. 1) MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_: the target simply forwards its pointer arguments to this function. We need its prototype and implementation to see whether its parameters for 'key' and 'value' are declared as const char * or char * and whether it ever modifies those buffers or stores the pointers directly (which would require non-const). If the nocheck function expects non-const pointers or modifies the data, then the target's use of const may be incorrect. 2) MHD_connection_alloc_memory_: this callee is invoked by the nocheck function (per the call graph). We must inspect its signature/behavior to know whether nocheck copies the key/value into newly-allocated memory (which would allow keeping the incoming pointers const) or whether it relies on modifying or storing the caller-supplied buffers directly. 3) struct MHD_Connection: the target passes 'connection' to nocheck. To decide if 'connection' itself should be const-qualified in the target, we must see whether nocheck (or other code reachable from it) modifies fields of the connection object. The struct definition is required to identify which fields might be modified (e.g., lists of header entries). 4) connection header entry structure/type used by MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_: inspect the type used to store header key/value pointers and lengths (the structure into which key/value are saved). Its field types (char * vs const char *) and whether storage is by pointer or by copying into allocated memory determine whether the original pointers must be non-const or may remain const. Together these symbols allow checking whether pointers passed in are ever written through or have their const qualifier effectively discarded, which is necessary to judge compliance with the MISRA const-pointer rule."
