Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for MISRA C \"for loop shall be well-formed\" analysis\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: The function operates on pp and reads/writes many of its members. To determine whether any of those members are used as loop counters or loop-control flags in a for loop (either in this function or in functions called from here), the full definition is required.\n  - MHD_PostProcessor::buffer_pos and buffer_size: The function's loop conditions and pointer arithmetic depend on these members. MISRA second-clause restrictions forbid using objects that are modified in the loop body; you must know whether these members are modified in this function or by called functions to judge compliance.\n  - MHD_PostProcessor::skip_rn, state, dash_state, must_ikvi, value_offset: These members are written in the function. If any for loop uses these as loop counters or control flags, writes here could violate MISRA. Their definitions and semantics are needed to check whether they are intended loop-control objects and whether they are modified improperly.\n  - MHD_PostProcessor::cls, content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding: These are passed to the callback pp->ikvi. The behaviour of functions called from within a for loop body is considered part of that body; to judge if any for loop (in this translation unit or in ikvi implementation) is well-formed you need to know what these arguments are and whether the callback may modify loop-control objects.\n  - MHD_PostProcessor::ikvi (function pointer) - prototype: The callback is invoked from this function (inside the final if). MISRA says the behaviour of a for loop body includes functions called within that statement. If any for loop (in this function or in code invoking this function) calls ikvi, you must see ikvi's prototype and implementation (or at least side effects) to determine whether it modifies loop counters or control flags used by a surrounding for loop.\n\n- enum PP_State (including PP_Error and the next_state / next_dash_state values): The function assigns to pp->state and may return PP_Error. To understand whether these enums are used as loop-control flags elsewhere (or within any for loops called here), you need their definitions.\n- RN_Dash: The function assigns pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash. If skip_rn is ever used as a loop-control flag in a for loop (here or in called functions), you must know RN_Dash's meaning/type.\n- PP_Error, MHD_NO, MHD_YES, MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: These macros/enum values are used as control/return values and in the callback invocation. Their definitions are needed to understand control flow and whether any of them participate in loop control in calling code or called functions.\n\n- memchr and memcmp prototypes: These library functions are called inside the loops. They do not modify loop counters themselves, but to be certain they have no side effects relevant to MISRA (they don't), include their prototypes to document their behaviour.\n\n- bool / false and size_t: Fundamental types used by the code. MISRA rules constrain how loop counters and flags are typed and modified; confirming the exact types (size_t, bool) is required to determine whether an object qualifies as a loop counter or a loop-control flag and whether any modifications are permitted.\n\nIn short: to determine compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule you must know all objects that could appear as loop counters or loop-control flags (their definitions and where they are modified) and the side effects of any functions called within loop bodies. The list above contains the pp fields read/written here, the callback prototype and arguments, the enum/macro values assigned/returned, the called library functions, and the relevant fundamental types. These are the minimal symbols required to analyze whether any for loop involving these objects would violate the MISRA rule."
