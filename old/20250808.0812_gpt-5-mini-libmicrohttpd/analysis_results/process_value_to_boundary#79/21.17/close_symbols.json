  "explanation": "To check for out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses in calls to memchr and memcmp and the subsequent buffer usages, the analyzer must know: (1) exact layout and relevant fields of struct MHD_PostProcessor (buffer_pos, buffer_size, value_offset, skip_rn, state, dash_state, must_ikvi and the ikvi callback and its prototype, plus content_* and cls) because buf is computed as (char *)&pp[1] and all buffer bounds and offsets are derived from those fields; (2) how instances are allocated/initialized (the routine that allocates pp and the trailing buffer) to ensure that the memory at &pp[1] is actually a contiguous buffer of at least buffer_size bytes \u2014 this is essential to prove memchr/memcmp size arguments do not read past the allocated object; (3) the constants and enum values used for control flow and early exits (RN_Dash, enum PP_State including PP_Error, MHD_POSTDATA_KIND) because they affect whether code paths that read or write beyond the buffer can be reached; (4) return macros MHD_NO and MHD_YES because they determine whether callers/paths abort (affecting invariants on buffer_pos); and (5) the exact prototypes of memchr and memcmp (from <string.h>) to reason about their size_t length argument semantics. Without these symbols/invariants you cannot prove that the length arguments passed to memchr and memcmp (and the subsequent indexing into buf) stays within the allocated buffer, so you cannot determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
