  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified process_value_to_boundary code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/634.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of process_value_to_boundary as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_value_to_boundary:\n```c\nstatic int\nprocess_value_to_boundary (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp,\n                           size_t *ioffptr,\n                           const char *boundary,\n                           size_t blen,\n                           enum PP_State next_state,\n                           enum PP_State next_dash_state)\n{\n  char *buf = (char *) &pp[1];\n  size_t newline;\n  const char *r;\n\n  /* all data in buf until the boundary\n     (\\r\\n--+boundary) is part of the value */\n  newline = 0;\n  while (1)\n  {\n    while (newline + 4 < pp->buffer_pos)\n    {\n      r = memchr (&buf[newline],\n                  '\\r',\n                  pp->buffer_pos - newline - 4);\n      if (NULL == r)\n      {\n        newline = pp->buffer_pos - 4;\n        break;\n      }\n      newline = (size_t) (r - buf);\n      if (0 == memcmp (\"\\r\\n--\",\n                       &buf[newline],\n                       4))\n        break;\n      newline++;\n    }\n    if (newline + blen + 4 <= pp->buffer_pos)\n    {\n      /* can check boundary */\n      if (0 != memcmp (&buf[newline + 4],\n                       boundary,\n                       blen))\n      {\n        /* no boundary, \"\\r\\n--\" is part of content, skip */\n        newline += 4;\n        continue;\n      }\n      else\n      {\n        /* boundary found, process until newline then\n           skip boundary and go back to init */\n        pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash;\n        pp->state = next_state;\n        pp->dash_state = next_dash_state;\n        (*ioffptr) += blen + 4;
