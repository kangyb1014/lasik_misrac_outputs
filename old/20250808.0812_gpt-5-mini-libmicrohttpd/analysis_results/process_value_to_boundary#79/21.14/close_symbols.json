  "explanation": "For deciding whether the two memcmp calls in process_value_to_boundary violate the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must know whether either operand is a null\u2011terminated C string (rather than a raw byte buffer) at the time of the call. The listed symbols are required for that determination:\n\n- post_process_multipart: this is the caller that supplies the boundary pointer and length to process_value_to_boundary. Inspecting it shows how boundary and blen are obtained and whether boundary is a NUL-terminated C string.\n\n- find_boundary: post_process_multipart calls find_boundary; find_boundary is the likely producer of the boundary pointer/length. You must inspect its behavior to see if it returns a NUL-terminated string or only a length-limited token.\n\n- boundary (as created/passed by post_process_multipart/find_boundary): you must examine the actual boundary object (allocation, termination) to know if it is a null-terminated string; the memcmp(&buf[newline + 4], boundary, blen) call compares against this object.\n\n- blen (the length value passed alongside boundary): you must know whether blen equals strlen(boundary) or is an explicit byte length independent of any termination; this affects whether memcmp is being (mis)used on NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (complete definition: members buffer_pos, buffer_size and the layout of the buffer storage &pp[1]): process_value_to_boundary treats &pp[1] as a buffer and uses offsets into it. To decide whether &buf[newline] or &buf[newline+4] are NUL-terminated strings at the call sites you need the struct layout and any guarantees about NUL termination or reserved sentinel bytes.\n\n- pp buffer write/initialization site (the code that fills/maintains pp->buffer contents): even with the struct definition you must inspect the code that writes into the buffer to see whether a terminating NUL is ever written at or after the positions in question (or whether data is raw bytes), so you can tell if memcmp is comparing strings vs. byte sequences.\n\n- memcmp (standard declaration/semantics): include the standard prototype/semantics as a reference for the MISRA rule application (to confirm that the function in use is the standard memcmp and to reason about length-limited comparisons vs. string comparisons).\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyst determine whether either memcmp call is being applied to NUL-terminated strings (which would trigger the MISRA prohibition) or to length-limited byte buffers (which does not violate the rule)."
