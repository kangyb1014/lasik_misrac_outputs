  "explanation": "To determine whether this function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the declarations it depends on that could themselves use or require extensions. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (complete definition): The code computes char *buf = (char *)&pp[1]; and accesses many fields (buffer_pos, buffer_size, skip_rn, state, dash_state, must_ikvi, value_offset, cls, content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding, ikvi). You must see the struct layout (including whether it uses flexible-array members, zero-length arrays, GCC __attribute__s, packed/unaligned attributes, or other non\u2011standard constructs) to decide if the &pp[1] trick or field accesses rely on a language/ABI extension.\n\n- prototype/type of pp->ikvi (the ikvi callback function pointer declaration): The code calls pp->ikvi(...). The declaration may use varargs, custom calling conventions or GCC attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))) or non\u2011portable types \u2014 any of these would be a language/compiler extension. You need the exact prototype to check for such extensions.\n\n- enum PP_State (complete definition, including PP_Error): The code assigns to pp->state and compares/sets PP_Error. The enum declaration might use compiler-specific extensions (explicit underlying type, attributes). The values must be known to determine whether any non\u2011standard enum usage exists.\n\n- definition of RN_Dash (macro or enum constant): The code assigns pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash. You must know how RN_Dash is defined (macro, enum, or typed constant) and whether that definition uses extensions.\n\n- definitions of MHD_YES and MHD_NO: The function returns MHD_YES or MHD_NO and compares against MHD_NO. These macros/enum values might be implemented via non\u2011standard constructs; their definitions are needed.\n\n- definition of MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: This identifier is passed into the ikvi callback; its definition (enum or macro) could hide extensions or nonstandard typing.\n\n- declarations/prototypes of memchr and memcmp (string.h declarations as used here): Although standard, the actual translation unit could remap these to compiler builtins or inline/attribute\u2011annotated variants. Seeing their declarations used by this build helps rule out use of compiler\u2011specific replacement macros/attributes.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets you check for zero\u2011length arrays vs flexible array members, GCC/Clang attributes, nonstandard calling conventions/varargs, or any other explicitly documented compiler language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
