  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified ws_get_accept_value code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/475.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of ws_get_accept_value as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ws_get_accept_value:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nws_get_accept_value (const char *key, char **val)\n{\n  struct SHA1Context ctx;\n  unsigned char hash[SHA1HashSize];\n  char *str;\n  ssize_t len;\n\n  if ( (NULL == key) || (WS_KEY_LEN != strlen (key)))\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  str = malloc (WS_KEY_LEN + WS_GUID_LEN + 1);\n  if (NULL == str)\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  strncpy (str, key, (WS_KEY_LEN + 1));\n  strncpy (str + WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID, WS_GUID_LEN + 1);\n  SHA1Reset (&ctx);\n  SHA1Input (&ctx, (const unsigned char *) str, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN);\n  if (SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS != SHA1Result (&ctx, hash))\n  {\n    free (str);\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  free (str);\n  len = BASE64Encode (hash, SHA1HashSize, val);\n  if (-1 == len)\n  {\n    return MHD_NO;\n  }\n  (*val)[len] = '\\0';\n  return MHD_YES;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above ws_get_accept_value code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function correctly declares 'key' as 'const char *' since it is only read, and declares 'char **val' (non-const) because the function (via BASE64Encode and by assigning/terminating (*val)[len]) modifies the object pointed to by 'val' (it produces and writes into the returned buffer). Rule 8.13 allows non-const pointers when the pointed-to object is modified; changing 'val' to point-to-const would be incorrect here.",
