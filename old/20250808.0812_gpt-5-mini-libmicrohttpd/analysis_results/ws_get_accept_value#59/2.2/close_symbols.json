  "explanation": "For determining whether any executed operations in ws_get_accept_value are dead code (i.e. their removal would not change program behaviour), the analyzer must know the precise semantics, side-effects and inter-procedural usage of the symbols below:\n\n- WS_KEY_LEN: Required to know the expected key length, control flow (the strlen comparison) and sizing of buffers; changing this affects whether early-return branch is reachable.\n\n- WS_GUID_LEN: Needed to know how many bytes of the GUID are concatenated and whether buffer operations and SHA1 input length are correct; affects whether the concatenation and subsequent hashing are meaningful.\n\n- WS_KEY_GUID_LEN: The length passed to SHA1Input; needed to know how much data is hashed. If this is zero or redundant, the SHA1-related calls might be dead.\n\n- WS_GUID: The GUID string appended to key; required to determine whether the string concatenation produces any meaningful input to the SHA1 operations (i.e. whether SHA1Input actually depends on unique data).\n\n- SHA1HashSize: Size of the hash buffer passed to BASE64Encode; needed to decide if the hash buffer usage and the BASE64Encode call are non-empty/meaningful.\n\n- SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS: The success constant tested after SHA1Result; necessary to know what SHA1Result returns on success/failure so the failure branch (free(str); return MHD_NO;) is meaningful.\n\n- struct SHA1Context: Definition needed to know if SHA1Reset/Input/Result have side-effects beyond producing a hash (e.g. global state, callbacks) and whether passing stack-local ctx is sufficient \u2014 affects whether those calls can be removed without changing behaviour.\n\n- SHA1Reset: Its semantics (pure reset of ctx vs global side effects) must be known to judge whether the call is required or dead.\n\n- SHA1Input: Must know if it actually consumes the provided buffer (const unsigned char *), whether it can fail, and whether it has external side effects (timing, internal state) that matter. Also whether it reads str (ensures str is used) or ignores data.\n\n- SHA1Result: Must know whether this produces the hash in 'hash' and whether it can fail; if it always succeeds or never uses input, subsequent BASE64Encode might be dead.\n\n- BASE64Encode: Critical to know its behaviour: does it allocate *val, does it write to *val, return value semantics (length or -1 on error), and side-effects. If BASE64Encode does nothing or always fails/succeeds deterministically, the code after it (including (*val)[len] = '\\0') may be dead or required.\n\n- ahc_cb: The caller(s) of ws_get_accept_value. Needed to see how ws_get_accept_value's return value and the produced *val are used by the program (e.g. whether caller relies on the side-effect of allocated *val or only on boolean return). Removing parts of ws_get_accept_value could be dead only if callers do not observe the removed effects.\n\n- MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO): The meaning of return codes and how callers react to them; required to determine whether returning MHD_NO vs MHD_YES (and associated side-effects such as allocated val) influences program behaviour.\n\n- malloc, free, strlen, strncpy: Standard library semantics must be assumed (allocation, deallocation, buffer copying, and string-length detection). Knowledge whether malloc can fail, strncpy truncation behavior, and free effects are needed to decide if memory-related operations are necessary or could be removed without changing observable behaviour.\n\nNote: The SHA1 helper internals called transitively (e.g. SHA1ProcessMessageBlock, SHA1PadMessage) could be relevant only if SHA1Input/Result semantics are not available; however, knowing the public behaviour of SHA1Reset/Input/Result and the constants above is the minimal concise set required to judge whether operations in ws_get_accept_value are actually contributing to program behaviour or are removable (dead code)."
