The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "cpuset_isset: The for loop body calls cpuset_isset(cpu_num, cpuset_ptr). To check MISRA\u2019s requirements that the second clause (cpu_num < max_num) does not use objects that are modified in the loop body and that the body does not modify the loop counter, you must know cpuset_isset\u2019s declaration/definition and semantics: whether it has side effects, whether it modifies its arguments (directly or via macros/inline code), or touches any objects used in the for-clause (for example if it were a macro that alters cpu_num or max_num).\n\ncpuid_t: The loop counter cpu_num is declared as cpuid_t. You must know the underlying typedef (scalar type, signed/unsigned width) to verify that cpu_num is a proper single loop counter, that ++cpu_num in the third clause modifies only the loop counter, and that passing cpu_num to cpuset_isset cannot cause aliasing or unexpected modification of the counter.\n\ncpuset_t: cpuset_ptr is of type cpuset_t and is passed to cpuset_isset. The type definition (or any associated macros) is required to determine whether operations on the cpuset via cpuset_isset could modify objects referenced in the for-clause (or otherwise introduce side effects that would invalidate the MISRA rule about the second clause not using objects modified in the loop body)."
