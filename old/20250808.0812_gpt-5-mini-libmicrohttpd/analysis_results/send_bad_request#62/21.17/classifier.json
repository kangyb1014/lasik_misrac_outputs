  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the presented code. BAD_REQUEST_PAGE is defined as adjacent string literals which the compiler concatenates into a single null-terminated string literal; calling strlen(BAD_REQUEST_PAGE) reads up to that NUL and therefore does not access beyond the bounds. A concrete violation scenario would be if strlen were called on a non-null-terminated buffer (for example, a char array filled without a terminating '\\0' or a pointer into a larger buffer where no NUL exists before the buffer end); in that case strlen could read past the object bounds and violate Rule 21.17.",
