  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified update_directory code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/4.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of update_directory as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of update_directory:\n```c\nstatic void\nupdate_directory (void)\n{\n  static size_t initial_allocation = 32 * 1024; /* initial size for response buffer */\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  struct ResponseDataContext rdc;\n  unsigned int language_idx;\n  unsigned int category_idx;\n  const struct Language *language;\n  const char *category;\n  char dir_name[128];\n  struct stat sbuf;\n  int res;\n  size_t len;\n\n  rdc.buf_len = initial_allocation;\n  if (NULL == (rdc.buf = malloc (rdc.buf_len)))\n  {\n    update_cached_response (NULL);\n    return;\n  }\n  len = strlen (INDEX_PAGE_HEADER);\n  if (rdc.buf_len <= len)\n  { /* buffer too small */\n    free (rdc.buf);\n    update_cached_response (NULL);\n    return;\n  }\n  memcpy (rdc.buf, INDEX_PAGE_HEADER, len);\n  rdc.off = len;\n  for (language_idx = 0; NULL != languages[language_idx].dirname;\n       language_idx++)\n  {\n    language = &languages[language_idx];\n\n    if (0 != stat (language->dirname, &sbuf))\n      continue; /* empty */\n    /* we ensured always +1k room, filenames are ~256 bytes,\n       so there is always still enough space for the header\n       without need for an additional reallocation check. */\n    res = snprintf (&rdc.buf[rdc.off], rdc.buf_len - rdc.off,\n                    \"<h2>%s</h2>\\n\",\n                    language->longname);\n    if (0 >= res)\n      continue;  /* snprintf() error */\n    if (rdc.buf_len - rdc.off <= (size_t) res)\n      continue;  /* buffer too small?? */\n    rdc.off += (size_t) res;\n    for (category_idx = 0; NULL != categories[category_idx]; category_idx++)\n    {\n      category = categories[category_idx];\n      res = snprintf (dir_name, sizeof (dir_name),\n                      \"%s/%s\",\n                      language->dirname,\n                      category);\n      if ((0 >= res) || (sizeof (dir_name) <= (size_t) res))\n        continue;  /* cannot print dir name */\n      if (0 != stat (dir_name, &sbuf))\n        continue;  /* empty */\n\n      /* we ensured always +1k room, filenames are ~256 bytes,\n         so there is always still enough space for the header\n         without need for an additional reallocation check. */\n      res = snprintf (&rdc.buf[rdc.off], rdc.buf_len - rdc.off,\n                      \"<h3>%s</h3>\\n\",\n                      category);\n      if (0 >= res)\n        continue;  /* snprintf() error */\n      if (rdc.buf_len - rdc.off <= (size_t) res)\n        continue;  /* buffer too small?? */\n      rdc.off += (size_t) res;\n\n      if (MHD_NO == list_directory (&rdc, dir_name))\n      {\n        free (rdc.buf);\n        update_cached_response (NULL);\n        return;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  /* we ensured always +1k room, filenames are ~256 bytes,\n     so there is always still enough space for the footer\n     without need for a final reallocation check. */\n  len = strlen (INDEX_PAGE_FOOTER);\n  if (rdc.buf_len - rdc.off <= len)\n  { /* buffer too small */\n    free (rdc.buf);\n    update_cached_response (NULL);\n    return;\n  }\n  memcpy (rdc.buf, INDEX_PAGE_FOOTER, len);\n  rdc.off += len;\n  initial_allocation = rdc.buf_len; /* remember for next time */\n  response =\n    MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback (rdc.off,\n                                                        rdc.buf,\n                                                        &free);\n  mark_as_html (response);\n#ifdef FORCE_CLOSE\n  (void) MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                                  MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION,\n                                  \"close\");\n#endif\n  update_cached_response (response);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function update_directory:\nstatic const struct Language languages[] = {\n  { \"no-lang\", \"No language specified\" },\n  { \"en\", \"English\" },\n  { \"de\", \"German\" },\n  { \"fr\", \"French\" },\n  { \"es\", \"Spanish\" },\n  { NULL, NULL },\n}\n...\nstatic const char *const categories[] = {\n  \"books\",\n  \"images\",\n  \"music\",\n  \"software\",\n  \"videos\",\n  \"other\",\n  NULL,\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above update_directory code violates the rule 14.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: both for loops are well-formed. Each loop initializes a single loop counter in the first clause (language_idx, category_idx), the second clause tests the counter by indexing constant arrays (languages[...] and categories[...]) which are not modified in the loop body and have no persistent side effects, and the third clause only increments the respective loop counter. The counters are not modified elsewhere in the loop body. Thus MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is satisfied.",
