  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The five (void) parameter-cast statements are a conventional, intentional way to reference unused parameters so as to suppress compiler warnings and to document intent; they are not considered a defect under MISRA practice. Strictly speaking those casts perform no observable runtime action and removing them would not change program behaviour, but MISRA\u2019s concern with \u201cdead code\u201d targets code that is genuinely redundant in intent (unused routines, unreachable blocks, leftover logic) rather than the deliberate unused-parameter idiom. In short: this idiom is the accepted way to mark unused parameters and does not constitute a Rule 2.2 violation in normal MISRA application. If you prefer, you may instead remove truly unnecessary casts or adopt an approved project annotation for unused parameters to satisfy both the compiler and static-analysis tools."
