  "explanation": "To make the file compile I added the minimal includes and declarations required by the code: declarations for struct MHD_Connection, struct MHD_Response, the enum MHD_Result, HTTP status constants, and function prototypes for MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response. I also provided a simple handler_param struct and a BUSYPAGE string (as a const variable rather than a macro). No mock function implementations or main() were added; the original ahc_echo logic was preserved as closely as possible."
