  "explanation": "For deciding whether pointers in keepalive_possible should be const-qualified (MISRA rule), the analyzer must know whether the function or any callees modify the objects pointed to and whether the pointed-to members are themselves declared const. Specifically:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): needed to see the exact types of all accessed fields (keepalive, rq, rp, read_closed, discard_request, stop_with_error). This lets you determine which fields are read-only in this function and whether the connection object or its subobjects are declared const elsewhere (which affects whether keepalive_possible's parameter can be const).\n\n- MHD_Connection.rp (type of 'rp') and the declaration/type of rp.response: keepalive_possible creates r = c->rp.response; you must know the actual member type (is it struct MHD_Response * or const struct MHD_Response * etc.) and whether rp or response are pointer-to-const in the definition to know whether r can/should be const-qualified.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (full definition): needed to check whether the response fields accessed (flags, flags_auto, upgrade_handler) are mutable or declared const and whether any fields are objects that could be modified by called routines; that influences whether r (the response pointer) can be a pointer-to-const.\n\n- prototype of MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci (and/or MHD_lookup_header_token_ci): this callee is invoked with the connection (or connection-like) pointer. You must know the parameter types (does it accept const struct MHD_Connection * or only non-const?) and whether it can modify the connection/response. If the callee requires a non-const pointer or mutates the object, keepalive_possible cannot mark its parameter const.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED and MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT (macro/function definitions): these are used with c->rq.http_ver; their definitions show whether they take the http_ver by value and have no side effects (so they don't prevent const qualification) or whether they expand to code that might write to the passed object (rare but must be checked).\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function definition): typically side-effect free, but the exact macro may evaluate its argument or call functions; confirming it does not modify the pointed-to objects is necessary before qualifying parameters const.\n\n- definitions of MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT and MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE: these are bit flags masked from response fields. Knowing they are plain constants/macros ensures that checks like (r->flags & ...) are read-only operations and do not imply modification.\n\n- type/definition of rq.http_ver and constants MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0 and MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION: to verify these are simple constants/identifiers (no side effects) and to confirm any header-lookup APIs use them only for reading; also to check whether any macros used here could hide write operations.\n\n- enum MHD_ConnKeepAlive (definition): to confirm the return values are ordinary enum constants and that returning them has no side effects relevant to const qualification.\n\nIn short: you must inspect the connection/response type declarations and the prototypes/macros of all callees/macros used on those objects to determine whether any of them require or perform modifications. If none do, the parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' and local 'struct MHD_Response *const r' could reasonably be changed to point-to-const types; if any callee requires non-const or any macro has side effects, they cannot."
