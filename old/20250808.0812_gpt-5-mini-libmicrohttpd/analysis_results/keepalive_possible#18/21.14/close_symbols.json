  "explanation": "1) MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci\n   - The target function calls this lookup routine to find tokens like \"close\" or \"Keep-Alive\". To determine whether a violation occurs we must inspect this function's implementation to see if it uses memcmp to compare header text to the provided token strings and whether it derives the comparison length from a null-terminated C string (which would trigger the MISRA rule).\n\n2) MHD_lookup_header_token_ci\n   - The static call graph lists this (similar) symbol; include it in case the real implementation is under this closely named variant. Same rationale as above: confirm where and how comparisons are performed.\n\n3) memcmp\n   - The MISRA rule is about use of the standard memcmp. We must inspect any uses of memcmp (direct calls or wrappers) in the lookup routine (or helpers) to see whether it compares null-terminated strings.\n\n4) strncmp, strcmp, strlen\n   - These standard string functions are commonly used together with memcmp (e.g. obtaining lengths with strlen or using strncmp/strcmp instead of memcmp). If the lookup code uses strlen to compute a length passed to memcmp, that can indicate a memcmp-vs-null-terminated-string violation. Also, the presence of strncmp/strcmp may show safer alternatives or additional string handling logic.\n\n5) struct MHD_Connection\n   - The connection/request data structure holds the request headers (source strings) and version fields used in the function. To determine whether header values are stored/parsed as null-terminated C strings (thus making memcmp usage suspect) we need the struct definition and the fields that point to header text.\n\n6) struct MHD_Response\n   - Response fields are referenced in the function; while less likely to hold header input, the response structure can influence lookup behavior or flags used by the lookup routine. Include its definition to see if any string fields are compared via memcmp in related code paths.\n\n7) MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION (macro/string)\n   - This macro expands to the header name string used in the lookup. Knowing whether the lookup uses this literal (a null-terminated C string) as one operand in a memcmp helps decide if memcmp is comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n8) request header storage / parser internals (types/fields used by the lookup routine)\n   - Ultimately the question is whether memcmp compares two null-terminated strings. That depends on how header values are stored (null-terminated C strings vs. buffers with explicit lengths). Include the types and functions that represent and produce the header text (header list nodes, buffer storage, parsing code) used by MHD_lookup_header_* so you can determine whether the operands passed into memcmp are NUL-terminated C strings.\n\nInclude these symbols (the lookup function(s), the standard string functions, the connection/response type definitions, the header macro, and the header storage/parsing internals) in the next-agent prompt so the implementation can be inspected for any memcmp usage that compares null-terminated strings."
