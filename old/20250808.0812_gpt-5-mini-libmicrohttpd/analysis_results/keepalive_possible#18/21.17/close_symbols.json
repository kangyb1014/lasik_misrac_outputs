  "explanation": "1) MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci (prototype and full implementation): The target function calls this routine to inspect header token strings. To verify no <string.h> function reads past buffer bounds you must inspect this function\u2019s use of string functions (strlen, strcmp/strcasecmp, strstr, strspn, memcpy, etc.), the exact pointer/length arguments passed, and whether it performs proper bounds/length checks.\n\n2) MHD_lookup_header_token_ci (if separate/alias): The static call graph shows a similarly named symbol; include it in case the build uses an alternate or aliased implementation.\n\n3) struct MHD_Connection (full definition): The lookup call receives the connection pointer; the layout and lifetime of fields (pointers to header storage, rq, rp, etc.) determine whether the buffers passed to string functions are NUL-terminated or have explicit lengths. You need the struct to follow pointer origin and ownership.\n\n4) type/definition of c->rq (request structure): The request object contains http_ver and the headers storage/indexes. The representation of header storage inside the request (how header values are stored/referenced) is essential to determine if string functions will be given bounded buffers or raw non-terminated slices.\n\n5) struct MHD_Response (full definition): The code reads r->flags, r->flags_auto, r->upgrade_handler and r is passed indirectly to header lookup (via connection->rp.response). Response header storage/representation may be used by lookup; its definition shows how header values are stored (pointers, lengths, ownership).\n\n6) header storage structures/types used for request/response headers (header list/array node type, value pointer/length representation): Critical to know whether header values are stored as NUL-terminated C strings or as pointers+lengths. If values are not guaranteed NUL-terminated, calls to string.h functions can read past bounds unless the lookup uses explicit length-limited routines.\n\n7) MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION (macro/identifier for the Connection header): This identifier is passed to the lookup implementation; how it is interpreted (index, string literal, etc.) affects the lookup path and which header buffer is examined.\n\n8) MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED / MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT / MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0: These macros/constants control control-flow and whether particular header lookups run. To determine if any string handling that may be unsafe can be reached, you must know exact meanings and results of these version checks.\n\n9) MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT, MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE, MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER (flag macros): These flags gate early returns and affect whether header inspection is performed. Knowing their values/semantics helps determine reachable code paths that exercise string functions.\n\n10) mhd_assert (macro): While mainly for diagnostics, asserts can affect whether debug-only checks are present; include to understand if additional runtime checks (e.g., null/length checks) are compiled in debug builds.\n\n11) UPGRADE_SUPPORT (build macro): The presence/absence of this compile-time flag enables an alternate early-return path that references r->upgrade_handler instead of performing other header checks. Knowing whether this is defined is necessary to know which string-handling paths are active.\n\nIn short: the decisive risk for violating the MISRA <string.h> rule is inside MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci and depends on how header values are stored/presented (NUL-terminated vs length delimited). To prove safety you must inspect the lookup implementation and the header storage/type definitions plus the small set of macros/flags that affect whether that code is reached."
