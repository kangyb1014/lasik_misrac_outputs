The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "SHA1CircularShift: This function is invoked inside every for-loop body. MISRA requires that the behaviour of the for-loop body (including called functions) has no persistent side-effects that affect loop control. To determine compliance you must inspect the full prototype and implementation of SHA1CircularShift to ensure it does not modify the loop counter 'i', any objects used in the loop clauses, or any global/volatile state that could act as a loop-control flag.\n\nstruct SHA1Context: The loops reference members of the context (message_block, intermediate_hash). You need the struct definition to know the types and qualifiers (e.g. whether any members are volatile, or alias to objects modified elsewhere) and to confirm that no member used in the loop clauses is modified in the loop body or by callees (which would breach the MISRA restriction on using objects modified in the loop body in the loop condition).\n\nAny functions called by SHA1CircularShift (and their definitions): If SHA1CircularShift itself calls other functions, those callees also form part of the loop body behaviour. MISRA requires inspecting the whole call chain for persistent side-effects or modifications to loop counters/objects used in loop clauses.\n\nInteger typedefs used (e.g. uint32_t): Knowing the exact integer types and their signed/unsigned/width properties is necessary to reason about expressions in the loop body and whether any operations could inadvertently modify loop control objects (for example via aliasing or undefined behaviour)."
