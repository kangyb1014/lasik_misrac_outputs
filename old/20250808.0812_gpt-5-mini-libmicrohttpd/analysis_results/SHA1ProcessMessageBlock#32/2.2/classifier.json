  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified SHA1ProcessMessageBlock code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/258.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock:\n```c\nstatic void\nSHA1ProcessMessageBlock (struct SHA1Context *context)\n{\n  const uint32_t K[] = { 0x5A827999, 0x6ED9EBA1, 0x8F1BBCDC, 0xCA62C1D6 };\n  int i;\n  uint32_t temp;\n  uint32_t W[80];\n  uint32_t A, B, C, D, E;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < 16; i++)\n  {\n    W[i] = ((uint32_t) context->message_block[i * 4]) << 24;\n    W[i] |= ((uint32_t) context->message_block[i * 4 + 1]) << 16;\n    W[i] |= ((uint32_t) context->message_block[i * 4 + 2]) << 8;\n    W[i] |= context->message_block[i * 4 + 3];\n  }\n  for (i = 16; i < 80; i++)\n  {\n    W[i]\n      = SHA1CircularShift (1, W[i - 3] ^ W[i - 8] ^ W[i - 14] ^ W[i - 16]);\n  }\n  A = context->intermediate_hash[0];\n  B = context->intermediate_hash[1];\n  C = context->intermediate_hash[2];\n  D = context->intermediate_hash[3];\n  E = context->intermediate_hash[4];\n  for (i = 0; i < 20; i++)\n  {\n    temp = SHA1CircularShift (5, A) + ((B & C) | ((~B) & D)) + E + W[i]\n           + K[0];\n    E = D;\n    D = C;\n    C = SHA1CircularShift (30, B);\n    B = A;\n    A = temp;\n  }\n  for (i = 20; i < 40; i++)\n  {\n    temp = SHA1CircularShift (5, A) + (B ^ C ^ D) + E + W[i] + K[1];\n    E = D;\n    D = C;\n    C = SHA1CircularShift (30, B);\n    B = A;\n    A = temp;\n  }\n  for (i = 40; i < 60; i++)\n  {\n    temp = SHA1CircularShift (5, A) + ((B & C) | (B & D) | (C & D)) + E\n           + W[i] + K[2];\n    E = D;\n    D = C;\n    C = SHA1CircularShift (30, B);\n    B = A;\n    A = temp;\n  }\n  for (i = 60; i < 80; i++)\n  {\n    temp = SHA1CircularShift (5, A) + (B ^ C ^ D) + E + W[i] + K[3];\n    E = D;\n    D = C;\n    C = SHA1CircularShift (30, B);\n    B = A;\n    A = temp;\n  }\n  context->intermediate_hash[0] += A;\n  context->intermediate_hash[1] += B;\n  context->intermediate_hash[2] += C;\n  context->intermediate_hash[3] += D;\n  context->intermediate_hash[4] += E;\n  context->message_block_index = 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above SHA1ProcessMessageBlock code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The SHA1ProcessMessageBlock implementation does not contain dead code: every computed value (W[], A, B, C, D, E, temp) is used in subsequent computations, the K[] constants are referenced, and the final updates to context->intermediate_hash and message_block_index affect observable program state.
