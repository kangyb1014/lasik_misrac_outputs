  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The five (void) casts are the usual idiom to mark parameters as intentionally unused and to suppress compiler warnings; they are not the kind of accidental, functionally-superfluous code that Rule 2.2 aims to forbid. Rule 2.2 targets executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour; in practice these (void) expressions document intent and affect build-time diagnostics (and, in some build/tool chains, analysis results), so treating them as dead code is not appropriate. The agent\u2019s empirical attempt (the test harness) also failed to produce evidence (it did not compile), so it does not demonstrate that the casts are forbidden or that they break the rule. If you want to avoid any question, common alternatives are: omit parameter names for unused parameters in the function definition, or use a dedicated macro (e.g. UNUSED_PARAM(x)) implemented portably. But the claim that the shown (void) statements violate MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 is not correct."
