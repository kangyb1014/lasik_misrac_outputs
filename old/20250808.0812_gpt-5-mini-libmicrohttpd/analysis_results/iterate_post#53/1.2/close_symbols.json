  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions/declarations of these symbols to decide whether the target function uses compiler language extensions (per the MISRA rule). For each symbol: \n\n- enum MHD_Result, enum MHD_ValueKind: These types come from the library/header that declares the callback API. Their declarations could use compiler extensions (e.g. nonstandard enum attributes, bitfield extensions, __extension__ markers). Confirm they are standard C declarations.\n\n- MHD_NO, MHD_YES: These macros/constants may be defined as simple enum values, macros or expressions. They might hide compiler-specific constructs or attributes (e.g. __attribute__, gcc extensions). Check their definitions.\n\n- struct connection_info_struct and connection_info_struct.answerstring: The struct layout or the declaration of the answerstring member might use compiler extensions (flexible array members, unnamed/anonymous members, attributes, nonstandard types). You need the exact struct definition to verify none of those extensions are present.\n\n- MAXNAMESIZE, MAXANSWERSIZE: These macros could be defined using extension syntax (e.g. sizeof abuse, typeof, compound statements in macros, or other GNU extensions). Inspect their definitions to ensure they are standard constant macros.\n\n- GREETINGPAGE: This macro/string is used as a format in snprintf; it might be a complex macro using compiler extensions (variadic macro syntax pre-C99, token pasting with extensions, or use of nonstandard format specifiers). Check its definition for extension usage.\n\n- malloc, snprintf, strcmp: Standard library functions, but their declarations in the included headers (or project-provided wrappers) might include compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__((malloc)), __attribute__((format(...))), or inline/extern inline semantics that are compiler-specific). Verify the actual prototypes used by the build.\n\n- uint64_t, size_t: These typedefs come from headers (stdint.h, stddef.h). On some toolchains they may be provided via compiler-specific headers or typedefs that use nonstandard keywords or macros. Confirm their declarations come from standard headers and not from compiler extensions.\n\nIn short, examining each listed symbol's header/definition lets you determine whether any nonstandard language/compiler extensions are being used (attributes, nonportable keywords, GCC/Clang __extension__ constructs, inline assembly, nonstandard macro tricks, etc.), which is required to judge compliance with the MISRA language-extension rule."
