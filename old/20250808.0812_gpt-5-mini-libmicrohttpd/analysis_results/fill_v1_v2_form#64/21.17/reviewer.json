If those arrays are not guaranteed to contain a terminating '\\0' within their bounds, strlen can read past the end of the arrays -> out-of-bounds access. Thus Rule 21.17 is violated: use of strlen may access beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic const char SECOND_PAGE[] =\n  \"<html><head><title>Tell me more</title></head><body><a href=\\\"/\\\">previous</a> <form action=\\\"/S\\\" method=\\\"post\\\">%s, what is your job? <input type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"v2\\\" value=\\\"%s\\\" /><input type=\\\"submit\\\" value=\\\"Next\\\" /></form></body></html>\";\n\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nfill_v1_v2_form (const void *cls,\n                 const char *mime,\n                 struct Session *session,\n                 struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  char *reply;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  size_t slen;\n  (void) cls; /* Unused.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. strlen(session->value_1) and strlen(session->value_2) (and the subsequent snprintf with %s) require that those arrays contain a NUL within their bounds. The snippet does not show the definition of struct Session or any guarantee that value_1/value_2 are NUL-terminated or otherwise terminated within their array bounds. If that guarantee does not exist, strlen and the %s conversions can read past the end of the arrays, which is exactly the situation MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids (string functions must not be able to access beyond object bounds). Note also snprintf with %s is subject to the same requirement. If there is a separate, provable invariant that those arrays are always NUL-terminated (or the code ensures termination before these calls), then the code can be compliant; absent such a guarantee the claim of a Rule 21.17 violation is valid. Recommended fixes include using bounded length checks (e.g. strnlen(session->value_1, sizeof session->value_1)) and using length-limited formatting (e.g. \"%.*s\" with the bounded length) or otherwise ensuring the arrays are NUL-terminated within their storage bounds before calling these functions."
