  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified answer_to_connection code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/437.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of answer_to_connection as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of answer_to_connection:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nanswer_to_connection (void *cls, struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                      const char *url, const char *method,\n                      const char *version, const char *upload_data,\n                      size_t *upload_data_size, void **req_cls)\n{\n  (void) cls;               /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function modifies the objects pointed to by pointer parameters (e.g. *req_cls = (void *)con_info; and *upload_data_size = 0;), which is permitted by Rule 17.8. The pointer parameters themselves (req_cls, upload_data_size, method, etc.) are not reassigned. Therefore the code complies with MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8.",
