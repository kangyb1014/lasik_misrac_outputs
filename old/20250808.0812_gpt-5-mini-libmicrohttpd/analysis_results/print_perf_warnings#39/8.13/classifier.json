  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified print_perf_warnings code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/315.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of print_perf_warnings as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of print_perf_warnings:\n```c\nstatic void\nprint_perf_warnings (void)\n{\n  int newline_needed = 0;\n#if defined (_DEBUG)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: Running with debug asserts enabled, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && ! defined (__OPTIMIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled without enabled compiler \"\n           \"optimisations, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined (__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled with size-optimisations, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701\n  if (MHD_NO != MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The libmicrohttpd is compiled with \"\n             \"debug asserts enabled, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n    newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n  }\n#endif /* MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 */\n  if (newline_needed)\n    printf (\"\\n\");\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function print_perf_warnings:\n#define MHD_VERSION 0x01000100\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above print_perf_warnings code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No pointer variables are declared or used in print_perf_warnings. The function only uses integer locals and passes string literals and integer values to fprintf/printf and calls MHD_is_feature_supported (no pointer parameters in the shown code). Thus there is no pointer that should or should not point to a const-qualified type \u2014 Rule 8.13 is not applicable here.",
