The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: This is the only non-standard function called by print_perf_warnings. To determine whether any for-loops (and whether they break the MISRA requirement) are executed as part of this function\u2019s behaviour you must inspect its implementation for for-statements and for any modifications to objects that could act as loop counters or flags.\n\n- MHD_NO and MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: These macros/constants are used in the conditional that guards the call to MHD_is_feature_supported. You need their definitions to know the conditional outcome and whether the call (and any code inside that call) is compiled/active.\n\n- MHD_VERSION: The call to MHD_is_feature_supported is itself guarded by a compile-time check on MHD_VERSION. You must know the value (or definition) of MHD_VERSION to determine whether that whole block is present in the translation unit being analyzed.\n\n- fprintf and printf: Although standard library functions rarely affect loop control in the caller, MISRA\u2019s rule treats the behaviour of functions called from inside a for-loop as part of the loop body. If any future analysis spots a for-loop in this function (or in code that is conditionally compiled in), you must be able to confirm that fprintf/printf do not modify loop counters or other objects used as loop control in the caller. At minimum, their signatures/semantics are needed to argue they have no relevant side effects on caller loop variables.\n\n- _DEBUG, __GNUC__, __OPTIMIZE__, __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: These preprocessor macros control which warning messages (and which assignments to newline_needed) are compiled. You need their presence/values to determine the exact compiled form of print_perf_warnings (which statements are present). That, in turn, determines whether any code containing for-loops (or calls that include for-loops) is present and therefore whether the MISRA for-loop rule applies.\n\nIn short: MHD_is_feature_supported and the MHD macros are necessary to inspect any hidden/called code that could introduce or affect for-loops; fprintf/printf and the compiler/debug feature macros are needed to confirm there are no relevant side-effects or compiled-in loops that would make a for statement ill-formed under the MISRA rule."
