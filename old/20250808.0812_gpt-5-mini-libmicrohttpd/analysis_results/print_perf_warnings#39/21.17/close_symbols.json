  "explanation": "1) MHD_is_feature_supported: The target function calls this function. To determine whether the overall behaviour of print_perf_warnings violates the MISRA <string.h> rule we must inspect the implementation of MHD_is_feature_supported itself (it may internally call string.h functions such as memcpy/strlen/etc.).\n\n2) All callees of MHD_is_feature_supported (transitive): If MHD_is_feature_supported calls other functions, those transitive callees must be examined for uses of string.h functions that could access out-of-bounds memory. The analysis must follow the whole call chain starting at MHD_is_feature_supported.\n\n3) MHD_NO: This macro/constant is used in the conditional that guards the printing branch. Its value affects whether the call to MHD_is_feature_supported leads to the warning path; knowing it is necessary to determine which code paths are relevant.\n\n4) MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: This symbolic feature identifier is passed to MHD_is_feature_supported. Its meaning/value may affect the implementation and code paths inside MHD_is_feature_supported and thus whether any string.h calls occur.\n\n5) MHD_VERSION: The call to MHD_is_feature_supported and its guarding code are conditional on MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701. Knowing MHD_VERSION (or build configuration that sets it) is required to know whether that code is present/compiled in and must be analyzed.\n\n6) _DEBUG, __GNUC__, __OPTIMIZE__, __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: These preprocessor/build macros control which fprintf/printf warning branches are compiled into print_perf_warnings. While the printed messages themselves are string literals (and do not use <string.h> functions), these macros determine which code paths exist; the analyzer must know which of those branches are present to limit the scope of analysis. (If any of those branches call other functions instead of direct fprintf/printf in your build, the definitions are needed to discover them.)"
