  "explanation": "__GNUC__, __OPTIMIZE__, __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: These are compiler-predefined macros (GCC-specific). To decide whether their use constitutes a compiler language/implementation extension you must inspect the compiler documentation/definitions for these macros (and whether the build relies on GCC-only behavior). _DEBUG: Often a compiler or build-system defined macro (MSVC/other toolchains); its origin must be known to decide if this is a compiler/implementation extension rather than a user build macro. MHD_VERSION: The code uses a numeric comparison against this macro; its definition (source/header) is required to determine whether it is a plain numeric macro or uses non\u2011standard extension semantics. MHD_is_feature_supported: Although shown in the call graph, you need its declaration/definition to check if it is implemented using compiler extensions (e.g. as a macro, inline asm, GCC attributes, or other non\u2011standard constructs). MHD_NO and MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: These macros/constants are used in the conditional and comparison; their definitions are needed to confirm they are ordinary macros/enum values and not implemented via extensions. fprintf, printf, stderr: Standard I/O symbols are used; include their standard declarations to confirm no non\u2011standard replacements or compiler-specific variants are being used."
