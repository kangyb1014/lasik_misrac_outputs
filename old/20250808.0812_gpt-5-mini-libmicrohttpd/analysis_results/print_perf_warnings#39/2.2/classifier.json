  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified print_perf_warnings code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/314.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of print_perf_warnings as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of print_perf_warnings:\n```c\nstatic void\nprint_perf_warnings (void)\n{\n  int newline_needed = 0;\n#if defined (_DEBUG)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: Running with debug asserts enabled, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && ! defined (__OPTIMIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled without enabled compiler \"\n           \"optimisations, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined (__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled with size-optimisations, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701\n  if (MHD_NO != MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The libmicrohttpd is compiled with \"\n             \"debug asserts enabled, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n    newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n  }\n#endif /* MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 */\n  if (newline_needed)\n    printf (\"\\n\");\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function print_perf_warnings:\n#define MHD_VERSION 0x01000100\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above print_perf_warnings code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Every executed statement in print_perf_warnings either emits a diagnostic (fprintf) or updates newline_needed which affects whether the trailing newline is printed. Removing any of those executed operations would change observable program behaviour (output to stderr or stdout). Conditional compilation may omit code entirely, but omitted code is not executed and therefore not dead code per MISRA 2.2 (note 2).",
