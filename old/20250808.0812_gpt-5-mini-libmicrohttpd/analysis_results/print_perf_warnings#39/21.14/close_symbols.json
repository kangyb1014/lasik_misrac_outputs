  "explanation": "For assessing whether print_perf_warnings (or anything it calls) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings:\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: This is the only non-stdlib callee of print_perf_warnings. You must inspect its implementation to see if it (directly or indirectly) calls memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- MHD_NO: The code compares MHD_is_feature_supported(...) against MHD_NO. You need the definition/type of MHD_NO to confirm this is an integer/enum sentinel (not a string) and that the comparison cannot be a string comparison hidden behind macros/typedefs.\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: Provide the definition/value/type of this feature identifier so the callee implementation can be fully understood (and to check whether any string-based lookups/comparisons occur using this identifier).\n\n- MHD_VERSION: The call into MHD_is_feature_supported is guarded by a MHD_VERSION compile-time check. Include the macro/value to determine whether that code path is actually present in the build being analyzed.\n\n- memcmp: Include the symbol (declaration/uses) so the analyzer can detect any direct uses of memcmp in the transitive closure (print_perf_warnings and its callees) and determine if it is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- fprintf and printf: These standard I/O functions appear in print_perf_warnings. While unlikely to violate the specific memcmp rule (the rule targets use of memcmp in user code), include them to confirm there are no wrapper/inline implementations in this codebase that might internally call memcmp for string comparison.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst inspect the called implementation(s), verify whether memcmp is used anywhere in the call chain, and confirm that any comparisons (e.g. against MHD_NO) are not string comparisons disguised by types or macros."
