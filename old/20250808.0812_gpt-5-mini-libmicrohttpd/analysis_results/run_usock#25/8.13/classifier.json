  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified run_usock code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/203.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of run_usock as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of run_usock:\n```c\nstatic void *\nrun_usock (void *cls)\n{\n  struct WsData *ws = cls;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = ws->urh;\n  unsigned char buf[2048];\n  unsigned char *msg;\n  char *text;\n  ssize_t got;\n  int type;\n  int i;\n\n  make_blocking (ws->sock);\n  while (1)\n  {\n    got = recv (ws->sock, (void *) buf, sizeof (buf), 0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n    msg = ws_receive_frame (buf, &got, &type);\n    if (NULL == msg)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n    if (type == WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME)\n    {\n      ssize_t sent;\n      int buf_size;\n      buf_size = snprintf (NULL, 0, \"User#%d: %s\", (int) ws->sock, msg);\n      if (0 < buf_size)\n      {\n        text = malloc ((size_t) buf_size + 1);\n        if (NULL != text)\n        {\n          if (snprintf (text, (size_t) buf_size + 1,\n                        \"User#%d: %s\", (int) ws->sock, msg) == buf_size)\n            sent = ws_send_frame (ws->sock, text, (size_t) buf_size);\n          else\n            sent = -1;\n          free (text);\n        }\n        else\n          sent = -1;\n      }\n      else\n        sent = -1;\n      free (msg);\n      if (-1 == sent)\n      {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      if (type == WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME)\n      {\n        free (msg);\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)\n  {\n    if (CLIENT_SOCKS[i] == ws->sock)\n    {\n      CLIENT_SOCKS[i] = MHD_INVALID_SOCKET;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_unlock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  free (ws);\n  MHD_upgrade_action (urh, MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE);\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above run_usock code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: run_usock receives a void *cls which is converted to struct WsData *ws and ws is later freed and its fields are accessed/modified (e.g. checking and clearing CLIENT_SOCKS entry, calling free(ws)). Because the function modifies/frees the object pointed to, the pointer must not be const-qualified. Similarly, msg (returned by ws_receive_frame) is freed by this function, so it must be a non-const pointer. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
