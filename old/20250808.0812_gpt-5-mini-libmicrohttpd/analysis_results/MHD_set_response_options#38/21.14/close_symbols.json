  "explanation": "For each symbol you must inspect its actual definition because a MISRA memcmp violation can be hidden inside macros, inline functions, or other symbol definitions. Explainations:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The function reads response->flags_auto, response->flags and response->total_size. If any of those fields are implemented via accessor macros or if the struct is actually a wrapper that triggers string comparisons (or macros that expand to memcmp/strcmp), that could conceal a memcmp usage comparing null\u2011terminated strings. The concrete struct definition (and any accessor macros) is required.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO): Although this is unlikely to contain memcmp itself, the exact definitions (macros or enum values) must be checked in case they are implemented via macros or inline constructs that could hide string comparisons. Also needed to understand return values used in the function.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseFlags: The flags referenced in the function (the type used for flags) must be inspected: individual flag symbols might be macros or computed expressions that expand to code (instead of simple constants), possibly invoking memcmp or other string comparisons.\n\n- MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH: This specific flag is tested in expressions. If it is defined as a macro or helper that uses memcmp/strcmp (for example, some libraries implement named-flag helpers or checks that compare header names), that could introduce a memcmp-on-NT string violation. Provide its definition.\n\n- MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE: Same rationale as above \u2014 this particular flag identifier must be checked to ensure it is a plain integer constant and not a macro that invokes string comparison.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH: This macro is used to test response->flags_auto. If it expands to code (e.g. a function-like macro or inline function) that does string comparisons (or calls a helper that uses memcmp), it could violate MISRA. Supply its definition.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions (MHD_RO_END and other MHD_RO_* values): The va_arg loop reads values of this enum and compares to MHD_RO_END. If any of the option tokens (or MHD_RO_END) are macros or inline constructs that hide memcmp, they must be inspected. Also some option token macros can be defined as expressions or calls rather than constants.\n\n- headers/translation unit that define the above macros/enums (the microhttpd internal header file(s)): To perform a thorough check you must examine the header(s) that contain the actual definitions and any transitive macros/inline functions they include. The MISRA rule violation can be hidden transitively (a macro used in a flag may call another macro that calls memcmp), so the full defining headers are required.\n\nIn short: inspect the concrete definitions (in headers/translation units) of all macros, enums and struct definitions referenced in the function (especially the flag and option symbols). Any of those could be non-trivial macros or inline functions that internally call memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings; examining their definitions is necessary to determine whether this function (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule."
