A pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct MHD_Response \u2014 required to know the exact member declarations (types and any const qualifiers) for flags_auto, flags, total_size, etc. The MISRA rule depends on whether the function actually modifies the object pointed to; the struct definition shows which members are writable and whether any members are declared const (which affects whether the pointer could be const-qualified). \n\n2) enum MHD_ResponseFlags \u2014 required to determine the type of the 'flags' parameter and of the response->flags member (whether assignment response->flags = flags is a modification of the pointed object and whether any const qualification is present on that typedef/enum). \n\n3) enum MHD_ResponseOptions \u2014 required to understand the va_arg usage and whether any of the response processing implied by those option values could modify the response; also to confirm that the varargs loop does not call functions that modify the response indirectly. \n\n4) MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH \u2014 required to know the declaration/type of this flag constant (macro/enum) and thus to confirm how it is applied to response->flags_auto (and whether that use implies any writes). \n\n5) MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH \u2014 required for the same reason as (4): to know its declaration/type and how comparisons affect the logic that may permit or prevent modifications of response. \n\n6) MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE \u2014 required to understand the tests that examine response->flags and flags and to determine whether those tests imply any hidden modifications or const requirements. \n\n7) MHD_RO_END \u2014 required to know the sentinel value used by the varargs loop and to confirm that processing of variable options does not modify the response (i.e., to ensure no implicit writes occur via option handling).\n\n(These symbols together let an analyst determine whether the function performs any write to the object pointed to by 'response' or whether it could be declared to take a pointer-to-const. Other return-value symbols (MHD_Result, MHD_YES/MHD_NO) are not required to assess pointer constness and were omitted for brevity.)"
