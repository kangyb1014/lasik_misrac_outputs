The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_get_connection_values as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_get_connection_values:\n```c\n_MHD_EXTERN int\nMHD_get_connection_values (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                           enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                           MHD_KeyValueIterator iterator,\n                           void *iterator_cls)\n{\n  int ret;\n  struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header *pos;\n\n  if (NULL == connection)\n    return -1;\n  ret = 0;\n  for (pos = connection->rq.headers_received; NULL != pos; pos = pos->next)\n    if (0 != (pos->kind & kind))\n    {\n      ret++;\n      if ( (NULL != iterator) &&\n           (MHD_NO == iterator (iterator_cls,\n                                pos->kind,\n                                pos->header,\n                                pos->value)) )\n        return ret;\n    }\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_get_connection_values code violates the rule 21.17 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: MHD_get_connection_values does not call any of the <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.). It only iterates over linked headers and passes header/value pointers to an external iterator callback. There is no direct use of string-handling library routines that could access beyond the bounds of objects. Note: if the external iterator implementation uses unsafe string functions that access out-of-bounds, that would be a separate violation in the iterator, not in MHD_get_connection_values.",
