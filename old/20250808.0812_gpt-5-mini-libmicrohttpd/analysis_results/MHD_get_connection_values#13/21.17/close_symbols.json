  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for analyzing MISRA string.h bounds rule:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): The function dereferences connection->rq.headers_received. The full struct is needed to confirm the precise types and layout of 'rq' and to verify that the headers_received pointer chain is valid and points to properly typed header nodes (relevant to whether subsequent string pointers come from bounds-safe storage).\n\n- type/definition of connection->rq: The member 'rq' holds headers_received; its type/definition reveals where headers_received comes from and whether that field is guaranteed to be non-overlapping memory (helps reason about lifetimes and bounds of header/value buffers).\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header (full definition): The function iterates 'pos' and accesses pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value, pos->next. To determine possible out-of-bounds string.h usage you must know the exact types of header/value (e.g., char *, const char *, pointer into a buffer, fixed-size array) and the linkage of next (to ensure traversal is safe).\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (definition): The bitwise test (pos->kind & kind) depends on the enumerator values and their intended usage as flags. Knowing the enum ensures the selection logic is correct and that the iterator receives the intended kind values (relevant to whether header/value contents are assumed to be NUL-terminated strings or specialized buffers).\n\n- typedef MHD_KeyValueIterator (function-pointer prototype): The iterator is called with (iterator_cls, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value). To judge potential string.h misuse you must know the parameter types (are header/value passed as const char * or as length-qualified buffers?) and the iterator's expected contract (whether it may modify or read past buffers).\n\n- definition of MHD_NO (and related iterator return constants): The code compares the iterator return to MHD_NO. The exact values and meaning (and whether the iterator uses other returns) are needed to reason about early returns and whether partially-processed buffers could result in unsafe string operations elsewhere.\n\n- declarations/types of pos->header and pos->value (exact types/qualifiers): Although these are members of MHD_HTTP_Req_Header, calling out their exact types/qualifiers (char *, const char *, pointer+length pair, fixed-size array) is critical: the MISRA rule concerns calls like strlen/strcpy/etc. \u2014 to evaluate safety you must know whether these pointers are NUL-terminated strings, whether a length is available, and whether callers are allowed to modify them.\n\nIn summary: to check whether any use of string.h could access beyond buffer bounds you must know the concrete definitions and types of the connection and header structures and the iterator prototype/semantics so you can determine whether header/value are string pointers, their bounds/termination, and how the iterator might use them."
