  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: needed to inspect the connection->rq.headers_received member and confirm the exact type/layout of the header list (where header/value pairs are stored). Knowing the container types is necessary to find whether any memcmp use would operate on null-terminated strings held in the connection.\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header: needed to see the fields (kind, header, value, next). The target iterates this list; to decide MISRA memcmp violations you must know what types these fields have and how they are allocated/terminated.\n- MHD_HTTP_Req_Header.header (field): explicitly required to determine its declared type (e.g. const char *, char *, or a length/byte buffer) and whether it is a NUL-terminated C string. The MISRA rule applies only if memcmp is used to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n- MHD_HTTP_Req_Header.value (field): same reason as header \u2014 need to know whether value is a NUL-terminated string that could be compared by memcmp.\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: the function tests (pos->kind & kind) \u2014 knowing the enum/bitmask definition helps understand which entries are passed to the iterator (and thus which header/value pairs could be subject to a memcmp inside an iterator implementation).\n- typedef MHD_KeyValueIterator (function-pointer signature): the code calls the iterator with (iterator_cls, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value). To decide if memcmp on NUL-terminated strings could occur you must know the iterator parameter types (are header/value passed as char */const char * or as (pointer,length) pairs) and the exact return type compared to MHD_NO.\n- MHD_NO (constant): the return value of the iterator is compared to MHD_NO. Its definition/semantics and type are needed to correctly interpret the iterator call and control flow (early return). Also its type may reveal the iterator return type.\n- answer_to_connection: this function is a known caller of MHD_get_connection_values (from the static call graph). To fully determine whether memcmp gets used to compare NUL-terminated strings in this execution path you must inspect caller(s) to see what iterator implementation (if any) they pass. If answer_to_connection (or other callers) passes an iterator that uses memcmp on header/value, that could make the overall behavior violate the MISRA rule.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine (a) whether header/value are NUL-terminated strings and (b) whether any iterator implementation reachable from the call sites performs memcmp on those strings (the exact scenario the MISRA rule forbids)."
