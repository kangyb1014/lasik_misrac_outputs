  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule that pointers should point to const when possible:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: needed to see the exact declaration of Addr and its member AddrData (including whether AddrData is declared const inside the struct). This determines whether taking &Addr->AddrData yields a pointer-to-const and whether any cast here strips const qualification.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: required to inspect the target accessor type used in the cast. Its field types (.sa, .sa_in, .sa_in6) and whether the accessor members are const-qualified determine if the cast preserves/removes const and whether the const-pointer usage is correct.\n\n- struct sockaddr (sa_family_t) or definition of .sa.sa_family: needed to verify the type of sa_family and that the switch on Accessor->sa.sa_family is using the correct member; also to check whether any const qualification on the nested .sa member affects pointer constness.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in (sin_port): required to know the type and qualification of sin_port (and whether it is a plain field or has any const qualifier) used through Accessor->sa_in.sin_port.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (sin6_port): same as above for IPv6 branch (Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_port) \u2014 required if OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 is defined.\n\n- in_port_t: the variable sa_port is declared as in_port_t; knowing its typedef is necessary to ensure the conversion/assignment and subsequent ntohs call are type-correct and do not imply any required const qualification.\n\n- ntohs: prototype is needed to know parameter and return types (and constness implications) when converting network to host order; ensures no pointer constness issues arise from its use.\n\n- uint16: required to know the exact type of PortNum (uint16 *) so we can reason whether it should or must be a pointer-to-const (it is an output parameter \u2014 this must be justified).\n\n- int32: required to confirm the function return type and whether any implicit constness rules apply to return values (generally not, but included for completeness).\n\n- AF_INET: value for the IPv4 branch of the switch; needed to ensure the code path and member accessed are correct and to check the related accessor member usage for constness.\n\n- AF_INET6: same as AF_INET but for IPv6 branch; needed only if OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 is defined.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: the compile-time macro controls whether the IPv6 case exists \u2014 needed to know whether the IPv6 accessor member (sa_in6.sin6_port) must be examined for const qualification.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS and OS_SUCCESS: the function returns these symbolic status codes. Knowing their definitions is necessary to ensure no const-related side effects (e.g., if they are typed in a way that affects pointer constness analysis) and to fully understand the control-flow and whether any pointer modifications occur before return.\n\nCollectively these symbols provide the type and const-qualification information of the struct members, the cast, and the function parameters so the MISRA check can determine whether any pointer should have been declared as pointing to a const-qualified type but is not."
