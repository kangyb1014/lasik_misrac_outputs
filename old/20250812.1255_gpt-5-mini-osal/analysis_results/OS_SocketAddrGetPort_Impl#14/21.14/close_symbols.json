  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, the analyzer must confirm that no call to memcmp (direct or indirect via macros/aliases) is used to compare strings in this function. The following symbols are needed and why:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: defines Addr and its AddrData member. Needed to see the actual type/layout of AddrData (e.g. whether it is a character array or contains string pointers) so we can determine whether any comparisons could be string comparisons.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: shows how AddrData is interpreted by the Accessor cast. Necessary to verify which fields are accessed and whether any of those fields are null-terminated strings (which would make memcmp usage relevant).\n- AddrData (member of OS_SockAddr_t): the raw storage being cast to the accessor. Essential to know the original storage type/size to ensure the cast does not hide any string comparisons.\n- Accessor->sa.sa_family (sa_family field): needed to confirm the switch selection and to inspect any macros or inline functions tied to sa_family that might perform comparisons (and possibly call memcmp).\n- AF_INET, AF_INET6: the family constants used in the switch. Required to fully understand control flow and to check for any conditional compilation or macro expansions tied to these constants that could introduce memcmp usage.\n- Accessor->sa_in.sin_port and Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_port: the fields read for ports. Required to confirm only numeric port fields are accessed (not string fields) and thus no string comparison occurs here.\n- in_port_t: port field type. Needed to confirm it is an integer/byte type (not a string) so no memcmp-on-string risk.\n- ntohs: the function/macro used to convert network to host byte order. Must be inspected because it could be a macro that expands to other operations; the analyzer must verify it does not expand to or call memcmp (unlikely, but necessary to check indirect memcmp usage).\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS and OS_SUCCESS: return values used by the function. Included to ensure no hidden helper macros/functions associated with these constants perform string comparisons.\n- int32 (return type): to verify function signature and any potential macros around return semantics that might invoke other routines.\n- memcmp: include the symbol itself so the analyzer can check for any direct uses, indirect calls, or macro aliases to memcmp within the function, the types it uses, or any headers/macros those types rely on.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyst determine (1) whether any accessed fields are null-terminated strings, (2) whether any called macros/functions could hide a memcmp or equivalent string comparison, and (3) that no explicit memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings in this function."
