  "explanation": "To determine whether this function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions/macros and types that could hide such extensions. Provide the following symbols/definitions:\n\n- BSP_DEBUG: This is a macro used for logging. Macros commonly expand to GCC/clang extensions (statement expressions, __attribute__, inline asm, use of '##__VA_ARGS__' tricks, or other non-standard constructs). Its expansion must be checked for any compiler-specific language extensions.\n\n- OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C: This macro converts the parsed numeric value. It may itself use compiler extensions (typeof, _Generic, __extension__, cast tricks, or non-standard integer literal suffixes). Inspect its definition to ensure it uses only standard C.\n\n- OS_BSP_Global: The global object whose member MaxQueueDepth is written. The type definition may include attributes, bitfields, or non-standard extensions (e.g. __attribute__ directives, packed/section annotations) that are compiler-specific.\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal: The global object that provides AccessMutex. The struct/type definition may contain compiler-specific extensions or typedefs that are non-standard.\n\n- AccessMutex (type/definition of OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex): The mutex member's type (probably pthread_mutex_t or a typedef) must be inspected in case it is an alias that uses compiler-specific constructs or attributes.\n\n- PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT: This macro/constant is used as an argument to pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol. Although typically POSIX, its definition in headers should be checked to ensure it does not rely on implementation-specific extensions.\n\n- pthread_mutexattr_t and pthread_mutexattr_* / pthread_mutex_* declarations: The declarations or inline definitions in the pthread headers could contain compiler-specific attributes or extensions. To be thorough, their prototypes/typedefs should be inspected.\n\n- FILE, fopen, fgets, fclose, strtoul, geteuid, strerror (their declarations): Standard-library and POSIX declarations are normally standard, but system headers sometimes include compiler-specific macros/attributes. For a strict MISRA language-extension check you should inspect these declarations (or at least confirm they originate from standard headers without nonstandard extensions).\n\nOnly after examining these macro expansions and type/header definitions can you confidently decide whether the target function uses any language/compiler extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
