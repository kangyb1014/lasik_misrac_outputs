  "explanation": "OS_BSP_Initialize has no function parameters, so Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) does not apply directly within this function. There are no assignments to any function parameter variables in the code shown. The code does pass pointers (e.g. buffer, &mutex_attr, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex) to library/OS functions; modifying the object pointed to is permitted by the rule, and there is no evidence in this fragment that any pointer parameter (i.e., a parameter variable) is being assigned to. Calls to standard/OS functions (fgets, strtoul, pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol, pthread_mutex_init, fopen, fclose, strerror) are external and their internal handling of their own parameters is outside this function\u2019s scope; nothing in this code assigns to a parameter variable. Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation for Rule 17.8."
