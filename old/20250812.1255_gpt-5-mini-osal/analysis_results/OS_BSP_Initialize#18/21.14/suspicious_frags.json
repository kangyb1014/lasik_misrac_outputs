  "explanation": "No uses of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The function OS_BSP_Initialize calls fopen, fgets, strtoul, strerror and several pthread_* functions; none of these are memcmp and none perform a memcmp-based comparison of null-terminated strings here. The provided macros (BSP_DEBUG and OSAL_BLOCKCOUNT_C) expand to an empty statement and a cast, respectively, and do not hide any memcmp calls. Therefore there are no code fragments in this unit that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
