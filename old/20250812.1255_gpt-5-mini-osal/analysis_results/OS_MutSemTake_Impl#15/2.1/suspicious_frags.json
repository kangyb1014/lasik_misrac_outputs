  "explanation": "I examined the entire OS_MutSemTake_Impl function and the related symbol definitions provided. No unreachable code fragments were found. Specifically:\n\n- There is no code following a return statement (the two returns are terminal and reachable depending on pthread_mutex_lock result).  \n- The conditional (if (status != 0) { return OS_SEM_FAILURE; }) does not make subsequent code unreachable because the else-path (implicit) reaches the final return OS_SUCCESS.  \n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro expands to an address-of-array-element expression and does not introduce any early returns or unreachable statements; passing *token to the macro yields the address &(*token) which is valid here and does not create unreachable code.  \n- There are no labels, goto statements, infinite loops, or other control-flow constructs present that would create unreachable code.  \n\nBased on these checks, there are no code fragments in the supplied function that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (unreachable code)."
