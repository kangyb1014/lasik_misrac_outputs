  "explanation": "No uses of the string handling functions from <string.h> (e.g., memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided target function or related definitions. Rule 21.17 specifically concerns accesses beyond object bounds caused by those functions. The code fragments present (macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET indexing into OS_impl_mutex_table, the inline OS_ObjectIndexFromToken returning token->obj_idx, the pthread_mutex_lock call, and the pthread_mutex_t member) do not invoke any <string.h> routines, so they are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation for that rule. If you want investigation for other MISRA rules (e.g., array bounds checking for OS_impl_mutex_table indexing or token validation), please specify which rule to check."
