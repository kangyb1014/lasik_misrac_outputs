  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function and related definitions. There are no calls to the C standard library function memcmp, nor to other string-comparison functions (e.g., strcmp/strncmp) in the shown code. The function only calls pthread_mutex_lock and uses macros to index an array of OS_impl_mutex_internal_record_t; none of these involve comparing null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no code fragments here that trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation."
