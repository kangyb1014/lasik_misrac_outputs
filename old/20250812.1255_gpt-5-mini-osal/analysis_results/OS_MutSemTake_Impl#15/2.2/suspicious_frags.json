  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that appear to be dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Reasons: \n- Every statement in the provided functions performs an observable action (calling pthread APIs, assigning the table lookup result, checking return codes and returning status). Removing any of these calls or checks would change runtime behaviour or error handling.\n- The OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro usage is necessary to obtain the mutex record and its id is used immediately for the pthread calls; it is not redundant.\n- Variables declared (status, return_code, impl, mutex_attr) are all used for subsequent operations or error handling; there are no unused assignments.\n- The create function performs initialization and attribute setup calls that affect mutex semantics; these are not removable without changing behaviour.\n- There are no statements that are executed but have no effect (no no-op expressions, no repeated identical assignments whose removal would not affect behaviour), and no unreachable code was presented.\nTherefore, based on the supplied code fragments, there are no obvious dead-code candidates to report for further MISRA Rule 2.2 investigation."
