  "explanation": "No explicit compiler/language extensions are used in the provided code. The fragment contains only standard C constructs: typedef aliasing of uint32_t, integer literals (0x09, 0x08, 0x01), macros, function calls, a while loop, increment operators, and comments. I checked for common vendor or compiler extensions that are commonly documented as extensions (for example: GCC/Clang __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement-expressions, labels-as-values, nested functions; MSVC __declspec; IAR pragmas or nonstandard keywords; named address-space qualifiers; extended integer widths or nonstandard storage-class specifiers). None of these appear. The use of true in while (true) is a standard boolean macro when <stdbool.h> is used (C99+); it is not a compiler extension. The macros like OS_OBJECT_TYPE_* and OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY and the typedef uint32 are user-defined and not language extensions. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions) based on the provided code."
