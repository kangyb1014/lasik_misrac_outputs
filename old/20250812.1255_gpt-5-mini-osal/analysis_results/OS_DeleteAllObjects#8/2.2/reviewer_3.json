  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following OS_DeleteAllObjects code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_DeleteAllObjects.\n```c\nvoid OS_DeleteAllObjects(void)\n{\n    uint32 ObjectCount;\n    uint32 TryCount;\n\n    /*\n     * Note - this is done in a loop because some objects depend on other objects\n     * and you will not be able to delete the object until the ref count becomes zero.\n     */\n    TryCount = 0;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        ObjectCount = 0;\n        ++TryCount;\n\n        /* Delete timers and tasks first, as they could be actively using other object types  */\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        /* Then try to delete all other remaining objects of any type */\n        OS_ForEachObject(OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        if (ObjectCount == 0 || TryCount > 4)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n        OS_TaskDelay(5);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The switch statement contains a default: break; branch that performs no action. When OS_IdentifyObject(object_id) yields a value not matched by any case, control enters the default branch and simply executes the break, which has no observable effect. Removing that default branch would not change program behaviour, so this operation is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nvoid OS_DeleteAllObjects(void)\n{\n    uint32 ObjectCount;\n    uint32 TryCount;\n    FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/66.txt\", \"a\");\n\n    if (log != NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(log, \"OS_DeleteAllObjects: entry\\n\");\n        fprintf(log, \"Initial state: logging enabled\\n\");\n        fflush(log);\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * Note - this is done in a loop because some objects depend on other objects\n     * and you will not be able to delete the object until the ref count becomes zero.\n     */\n    TryCount = 0;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        ObjectCount = 0;\n        ++TryCount;\n\n        if (log != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(log, \"Iteration start: TryCount=%u, ObjectCount reset to %u\\n\",\n                    (unsigned)TryCount, (unsigned)ObjectCount);\n            fflush(log);\n        }\n\n        /* Delete timers and tasks first, as they could be actively using other object types  */\n        if (log != NULL) { fprintf(log, \"Calling OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB)\\n\"); fflush(log); }\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        if (log != NULL) { fprintf(log, \"Returned from TIMECB loop, ObjectCount=%u\\n\", (unsigned)ObjectCount); fflush(log); }\n\n        if (log != NULL) { fprintf(log, \"Calling OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE)\\n\"); fflush(log); }\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        if (log != NULL) { fprintf(log, \"Returned from TIMEBASE loop, ObjectCount=%u\\n\", (unsigned)ObjectCount); fflush(log); }\n\n        if (log != NULL) { fprintf(log, \"Calling OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK)\\n\"); fflush(log); }\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        if (log != NULL) { fprintf(log, \"Returned from TASK loop, ObjectCount=%u\\n\", (unsigned)ObjectCount); fflush(log); }\n\n        /* Then try to delete all other remaining objects of any type */\n        if (log != NULL) { fprintf(log, \"Calling OS_ForEachObject (all remaining types)\\n\"); fflush(log); }\n        OS_ForEachObject(OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        if (log != NULL) { fprintf(log, \"Returned from OS_ForEachObject, ObjectCount=%u\\n\", (unsigned)ObjectCount); fflush(log); }\n\n        if (ObjectCount == 0 || TryCount > 4)\n        {\n            if (log != NULL)\n            {\n                if (ObjectCount == 0)\n                {\n                    fprintf(log, \"Breaking out: ObjectCount == 0 (all objects deleted)\\n\");\n                }\n                if (TryCount > 4)\n                {\n                    fprintf(log, \"Breaking out: TryCount > 4 (TryCount=%u)\\n\", (unsigned)TryCount);\n                }\n                fflush(log);\n                fclose(log);\n                log = NULL;\n            }\n            break;\n        }\n\n        if (log != NULL)\n        {\n            fprintf(log, \"Objects remain (ObjectCount=%u).

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The supplied OS_DeleteAllObjects implementation contains no switch statement and therefore no default: break; branch or any reference to OS_IdentifyObject(object_id). The agent\u2019s scenario describes a different piece of code; it does not apply to the provided function. The execution log simply shows the loop calling the for-each helpers and breaking when ObjectCount == 0 \u2014 no unreachable or removable executed statement (dead code) is present in the shown function. Therefore the claimed MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 violation for this function is incorrect."
