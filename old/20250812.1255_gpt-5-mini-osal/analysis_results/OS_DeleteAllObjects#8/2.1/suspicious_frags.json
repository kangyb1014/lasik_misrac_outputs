  "explanation": "I have flagged fragments where code execution may be statically or practically unreachable (or where iteration bounds vs. the numeric object-type constants could make certain paths never executed):\n- Calls that pass explicit object-type constants (TIMECB/TIMEBASE/TASK) and the subsequent generic OS_ForEachObject call \u2014 these rely on the iterator accepting those type values.\n- The OS_ForEachObject loop header using OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER as the loop bound \u2014 mismatch between this bound and the explicit object-type numeric constants can make iterations (and therefore callback invocations) never occur.\n- The iterator-init conditional and its inner while loop in OS_ForEachObjectOfType \u2014 if OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit fails for some idtype the inner body becomes unreachable for that idtype.\n- The while(true) loop in OS_DeleteAllObjects together with its break condition (TryCount/ObjectCount) \u2014 included because the loop control could hide unreachable code paths or create a logic that never exits in some configurations.\n- The clock_nanosleep do/while loop \u2014 included because repeated EINTR can prevent progressing to subsequent code in some environments.\n- The large switch on OS_IdentifyObject \u2014 included because, combined with potential iterator/type-range issues, some case branches may never be reached.\n\nWhy other fragments were NOT flagged: small wrappers and straightforward return/alias definitions (for example the trivial OS_TaskDelay wrapper that just calls OS_TaskDelay_Impl, the simple filter struct setup in OS_ForEachObjectOfType, and the macro alias OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY) do not by themselves introduce statically unreachable code and so were not listed. The flagged fragments are those where there is a realistic risk (by mismatched numeric type values or iterator/init conditions) that code paths can never be executed and therefore should be investigated for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
