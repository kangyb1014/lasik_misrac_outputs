  "scenario": "The local variable 'Function' is declared as void * and assigned from dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName), but it is only used for inspection (stored into SymbolAddress as an integer) and not used to modify the pointed-to object. Therefore it could be declared as const void *Function (or another const-qualified pointer type). This fails MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 which requires pointers to be const-qualified whenever possible."
