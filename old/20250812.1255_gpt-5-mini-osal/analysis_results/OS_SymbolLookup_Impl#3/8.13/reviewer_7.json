  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 recommends that pointer types be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified through that pointer. In the posted OS_SymbolLookup_Impl there is no local variable named 'Function' and the only pointer parameters / locals are:\n- SymbolAddress (cpuaddr *): this is an out-parameter that the function (or the functions it calls) writes into, so it must not be const.\n- SymbolName (const char *): already const-qualified.\n- iter (OS_object_iter_t) and integer locals: not applicable.\n\nTherefore the specific complaint about a local 'void *Function' does not apply to the submitted OS_SymbolLookup_Impl code. If Agent A saw a 'void *Function' it must be in a different function (for example inside the symbol-lookup helpers); that separate location should be inspected independently. Based on the shown function, there is no violation of Rule 8.13.\n\nRecommendation: if another helper actually declares 'void *Function' and only reads the pointer (never modifies the pointed-to object), then changing it to 'const void *' (or a more specific const-qualified pointer type) would align with Rule 8.13."
