Therefore it could be declared as const void *Function (or another const-qualified pointer type). This fails MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 which requires pointers to be const-qualified whenever possible.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_SymbolLookup_Log(const char *stage, const char * const SymbolName, const void * const SymbolAddress_ptr, const void * const iter_token_ptr, int32_t status, int32_t local_status)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/27.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        /* Best-effort: if logging fails, do not disturb normal operation. */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    time_t t = time(NULL);\n    if (t == (time_t)(-1))\n    {\n        fprintf(f, \"[UNKNOWN_TIME]\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Print epoch seconds for portability and simplicity */\n        fprintf(f, \"[%ld]\", (long)t);\n    }\n\n    fprintf(f, \" %s: SymbolName=%s, SymbolAddress_ptr=%p, iter_token_ptr=%p, status=%d, local_status=%d\\n\",\n            (stage != NULL ? stage : \"(null)\"),\n            (SymbolName != NULL ?

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the provided OS_SymbolLookup_Impl code. The claimed local variable 'Function' (void * assigned from dlsym) does not exist in the shown function; OS_SymbolLookup_Impl only has SymbolAddress (cpuaddr *) and SymbolName (const char *). SymbolName is already const-qualified. SymbolAddress is an output parameter which the function (or callees) write into, so it must not be const \u2014 making it a pointer to const would be incorrect. The added logging code merely casts the output pointer to const void * for printing, which is harmless and not a violation of Rule 8.13. If a real violation exists it would be inside OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl or OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl (where a non-const pointer is used only for inspection), but that is outside the submitted target code. Therefore Agent A's claim about this function violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is incorrect."
