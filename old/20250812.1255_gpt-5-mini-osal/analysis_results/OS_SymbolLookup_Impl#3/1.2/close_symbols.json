  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C rule about language extensions, you must inspect any type, macro or called function whose definition/decl could introduce compiler-specific extensions that the target function relies on. Concise rationale for each symbol:\n\n- cpuaddr: typedef of this integer/address type could be implemented with compiler-specific types (e.g. __int128, builtin address types) or nonstandard attributes \u2014 inspect its typedef/declaration.\n\n- int32: examine its typedef (often a typedef alias) to ensure it is not defined using a compiler-specific extension.\n\n- OS_object_iter_t: the iterator type definition (including the token member) may use nonstandard features (bit-fields with implementation-dependent widths, anonymous structs/unions, attributes, flexible array members implemented with extensions) that would mean the target function relies on language extensions.\n\n- OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE: this macro/constant is passed directly in the call; its definition might contain casts, compiler-specific literal syntax, or attributes (e.g. GCC extension macros) that would constitute an extension used by the target.\n\n- OS_SUCCESS: macro/enum constant \u2014 its definition could be an expression using extensions or attributes; verify it is a plain constant.\n\n- OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl (declaration/definition): the prototype/definition must be checked for use of language extensions (e.g. varargs in nonstandard ways, GCC attributes, nonstandard calling conventions, inline assembly inlined, typeof, or other extensions) because the target calls it.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIterateActive (declaration/definition): the iterator init function prototype/definition may use extensions or create iterator state that uses nonstandard constructs the target relies on; check for attributes, anonymous structs/unions, or compiler-specific constructs.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext (declaration/definition): this iterator accessor is used in the loop condition \u2014 its signature/implementation could use extensions (e.g. inline assembly, typeof, statement-expressions) that would imply extension usage in the calling context.\n\n- OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl (declaration/definition): the function called with &iter.token must be checked for parameter types or implementation that use extensions (function attributes, nonstandard pointer casts, inline assembly, or nonportable constructs) which could make the usage in the target rely on extensions.\n\n- OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy (declaration/definition): the destroy function may invoke operations (e.g. transaction cancel) implemented with extensions; its prototype/definition should be inspected to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are used that affect the target.\n\nIn short: inspect the typedefs/macros used directly in the function signature/body and the declarations/definitions of the functions called by OS_SymbolLookup_Impl to detect any compiler-specific language extensions that the target function would be using indirectly."
