  "explanation": "The remaining parts of the function do not contain control-flow constructs or statements that could be unreachable by themselves and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 2.1: the function signature and the local variable declarations are not executable paths; the opening and closing braces and whitespace are not relevant; there is no code following the final return that could be unreachable. Any macro/typedef definitions provided separately (in the additional code) do not by themselves introduce unreachable code within this function body and thus are not flagged here for Rule 2.1. Note: other potential issues (e.g. dereferencing a NULL token or out-of-range indexing) are safety/robustness concerns but are not, by themselves, instances of unreachable code and so are not included as suspicious fragments for this rule."
