  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are present in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, typeof, __extension__, __thread, or other vendor-specific keywords.\n- There are no inline assembly blocks or compiler pragmas that are non-standard.\n- The use of pthread_mutex_t and pthread_mutex_lock is a POSIX library API, not a C language extension.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and its use are standard C preprocessor and expression usage (the & and dereference usage is valid C), and the typedefs (int32_t based int32) are standard typedefs.\n- No compound literals, VLAs, or other C99/C11-only features that would be considered compiler extensions are used; the constructs shown are standard C and/or POSIX library usage.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
