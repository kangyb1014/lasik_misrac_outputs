Nothing in this fragment guarantees that stream->stream_name (fixed-size array of length OS_MAX_PATH_LEN) is NUL-terminated, nor that the caller-provided Filename is NUL-terminated within its allocated bounds. For example, if stream->stream_name was set via a bounded copy that did not append a terminating NUL (or was corrupted), strcmp will read beyond the OS_MAX_PATH_LEN buffer and violate Rule 21.17. Similarly a non-terminated Filename would also cause out-of-bounds reads.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_CloseFileByName_probe(const OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream, const char *Filename, OS_object_token_t token)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/183.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Determine the compile-time size of the stream_name array and whether it contains a NUL within that bound. */\n    size_t buf_len = sizeof(stream->stream_name);\n    const void *nul_ptr = memchr(stream->stream_name, '\\0', buf_len);\n    size_t name_len = nul_ptr ?

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The agent A's report is correct given only the code shown. strcmp reads each operand until a terminating '\\0', so calling strcmp(stream->stream_name, Filename) can produce out\u2011of\u2011bounds reads unless both operands are guaranteed to contain a NUL within their object bounds. In the fragment: \u2022 Filename is only checked for non\u2011NULL (OS_CHECK_POINTER) \u2014 there is no proof here that the caller supplied a NUL\u2011terminated buffer or that its storage is large enough. \u2022 stream->stream_name appears to be a fixed\u2011size buffer, but this function does not show any invariant or prior proof that it is always NUL\u2011terminated. Therefore, absent a documented and provable contract elsewhere that both strings are NUL\u2011terminated within their object bounds, the call can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Note: If the wider codebase provides a verifiable invariant that stream->stream_name is always NUL\u2011terminated and callers always pass NUL\u2011terminated Filename strings, then the use of strcmp would be acceptable; however, that proof is not present in the snippet, so the agent\u2019s finding is valid. Suggested mitigations: ensure stream_name is always NUL\u2011terminated on writes, validate via memchr/explicit length checks before calling strcmp, or use a bounded comparison (e.g., strncmp with the buffer size) and handle the non\u2011terminated case explicitly."
