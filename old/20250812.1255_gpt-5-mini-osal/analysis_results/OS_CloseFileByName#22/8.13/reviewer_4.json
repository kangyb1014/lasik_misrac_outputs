The iter->base member is declared as OS_common_record_t * but the function only reads from the table (e.g. record->active_id) and does not modify the pointed-to data. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, pointers that are used only to access objects should be const-qualified. Therefore iter->base (and correspondingly 'record') should be declared as const OS_common_record_t * (and the macro adjusted if necessary). This constitutes a violation of Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void os179_log_printf(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/179.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_CloseFileByName(const char *Filename)\n{\n    int32                        return_code;\n    int32                        close_code;\n    OS_object_iter_t             iter;\n    OS_stream_internal_record_t *stream;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_POINTER(Filename);\n\n    /* Log entry */\n    os179_log_printf(\"ENTER: OS_CloseFileByName Filename_ptr=%p Filename=\\\"%s\\\"\", (void *)Filename, Filename ?

  "explanation": "The report is not sufficiently supported. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever that is possible (i.e. the object is never modified through that pointer). Agent A asserts that iter->base (and a local record variable in OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext) are only read and therefore should be declared const. However the claim omits the wider API/usage context required to determine whether const qualification is actually possible:\n\n- The iterator object (iter->base and related macros) is part of an iterator API that is also used to process entries (OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry) and to perform close operations (OS_FileIteratorClose). Those operations typically need to modify table entries. If any code in the iterator implementation or in iterator callbacks writes through that pointer, then it cannot be declared const.\n\n- A local pointer in a single function could be declared const if that function only reads via it, but changing the type of iter->base in the iterator data structure (and the macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) is an API-wide change. You must verify all uses of iter->base and OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET across the codebase before concluding a violation. Agent A provided no evidence that the pointer is never used for writes anywhere else.\n\n- The provided test/logging code only exercises OS_CloseFileByName and does not demonstrate that iter->base is immutable across the entire project. The empty test log and the fact the test compiled do not prove that the pointer can be const-qualified globally.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the report is not correct: there is no demonstrated MISRA 8.13 violation. To prove a real violation you would need to show that the pointer declaration in the iterator API (and any macros returning it) can be safely changed to point-to-const in all translation units (i.e. no writes occur through it anywhere). Without that global proof the current non-const declaration may be justified."
