  "explanation": "Other pointer uses do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: fsdevname and fsvolname are already const-qualified (const char *); the various name buffers in the record are char arrays (not pointers) so the rule does not apply to them; OS_FILESYS_RAMDISK_VOLNAME_PREFIX is declared const; the local pointer OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys is used to modify the record and thus cannot be const; uses of token and APIs take non-const token pointers as required by those interfaces. Therefore the only places where a non-const pointer-to-char is stored/accepted but never modified (and thus could be considered for const-qualification) are the function parameter declaration for address, the struct field declaration for address, and the assignment copying the parameter into the struct."
