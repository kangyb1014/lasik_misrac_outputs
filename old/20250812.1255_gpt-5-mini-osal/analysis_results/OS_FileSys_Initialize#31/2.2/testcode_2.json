  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nWhen should_format is true the code calls OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl(&token). In the provided project OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl is implemented as a no-op that unconditionally returns OS_SUCCESS. Since return_code was already OS_SUCCESS at that point, invoking this function has no observable effect \u2014 removing the call would not change program behaviour. Therefore this executed operation is dead code in this project.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_FileSys_Initialize code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/250.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_FileSys_Initialize as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileSys_Initialize:\n```c\nint32 OS_FileSys_Initialize(char *address, const char *fsdevname, const char *fsvolname, size_t blocksize,\n                            osal_blockcount_t numblocks, bool should_format)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys;\n    int32                         return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t             token;\n\n    /*\n     * Check parameters\n     *\n     * Note \"address\" is not checked, because in certain configurations it can be validly null.\n     */\n    OS_CHECK_STRING(fsdevname, sizeof(filesys->device_name), OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG);\n    OS_CHECK_STRING(fsvolname, sizeof(filesys->volume_name), OS_FS_ERR_PATH_TOO_LONG);\n\n    /* check names are not empty strings */\n    if (fsdevname[0] == 0 || fsvolname[0] == 0)\n    {\n        return OS_FS_ERR_PATH_INVALID;\n    }\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdAllocateNew(LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, fsdevname, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, token);\n\n        /* Reset the table entry and save the name */\n        OS_OBJECT_INIT(token, filesys, device_name, fsdevname);\n\n        /* populate the VolumeName and BlockSize ahead of the Impl call,\n         * so the implementation can reference this info if necessary */\n        filesys->blocksize = blocksize;\n        filesys->numblocks = numblocks;\n        filesys->address   = address;\n        strncpy(filesys->volume_name, fsvolname, sizeof(filesys->volume_name) - 1);\n\n        /*\n         * Determine basic type of filesystem, if not already known\n         *\n         * if either an address was supplied, or if the volume name\n         * contains the string \"RAM\" then it is a RAM disk.
