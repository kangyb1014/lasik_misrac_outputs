  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in this fragment. The code only uses standard C constructs (function definition, local int variable, if/else, comments) and POSIX threading APIs (pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_setcancelstate, strerror). POSIX library calls are not compiler language extensions and therefore do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific extensions such as inline assembly (__asm__, asm), GCC statement-expressions ({ ...; }) or typeof, nested functions, __attribute__ annotations, __extension__, pragmas that enable extensions, variadic macros using compiler-specific syntax, or other documented compiler-only language extensions. Therefore no code fragments in the provided function need to be flagged for investigation under Rule 1.2."
