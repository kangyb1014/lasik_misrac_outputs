  "explanation": "No other code fragments need investigation for Rule 8.13 because there are no other pointer expressions, pointer parameters, or pointer variable declarations in the function. The local object is an int (status) and no pointer casts or pointer-returning operations (besides strerror) are used elsewhere. The BSP_DEBUG macro is defined empty and does not introduce additional pointer usage. The only pointer usages in the function are the three listed calls; all other lines are simple scalar operations or control flow and thus not relevant to the pointer const-qualification concern of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
