  "explanation": "- pthread_mutex_lock: Essential to determine its return-value semantics (range and sign). The function tests \"status < 0\"; to prove the if-branch reachable/unreachable you must know whether pthread_mutex_lock can legitimately return negative values (POSIX specifies 0 or a positive error number).\n- pthread_setcancelstate: Present in the else branch. Knowing its prototype/behavior confirms there is no hidden control flow that could affect reachability analysis of the else branch.\n- PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE: The macro/constant passed to pthread_setcancelstate; needed to verify the call is well-formed and has no side effects that impact reachability.\n- BSP_DEBUG: Macro/function used inside the if-branch. If BSP_DEBUG expands to something with conditional compilation or unreachable constructs, it could affect whether the if-branch is meaningful; include it to inspect any macro expansion that might change control flow.\n- strerror: Used in the if-branch; include to check for side effects or non-standard behavior that could affect reachability reasoning.\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal: The global structure referenced; include to confirm types/initialization of its fields and whether their definitions could affect calls (e.g., via macros or atypical types).\n- AccessMutex (field): The exact type/definition of this field (expected pthread_mutex_t) is needed to ensure pthread_mutex_lock is being called in the normal way and to rule out nonstandard wrappers that might change return behavior.\n- AccessCancelState (field): The type/definition of this field (likely int) is used in pthread_setcancelstate; include to confirm correct usage and that it does not alter control flow semantics.\n- pthread_mutex_t (type): Include the type definition to detect any platform-specific typedefs or wrappers that could change semantics of pthread_mutex_lock.\n- pthread_setcancelstate prototype/semantics: In addition to its name, include its documented return/behavior contract to ensure it cannot produce control-flow effects that would render code unreachable.\n\nThese symbols provide the minimal visibility into the called APIs, macros, and referenced globals needed to determine whether the if (status < 0) path can ever be taken (and thus whether either branch is unreachable) for MISRA C unreachable-code analysis."
