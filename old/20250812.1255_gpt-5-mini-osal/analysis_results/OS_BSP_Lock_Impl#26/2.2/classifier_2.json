  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_Lock_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_Lock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_lock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_lock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * Temporarily Disable/Defer thread cancellation.\n         * Note that OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl() calls write() which is a cancellation point.\n         * So if this calling task is canceled, it risks leaving the BSP locked.\n         */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BSP_Lock_Impl:\n#define BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobalData_t OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n...\nvoid OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Restore previous cancellability state */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState, NULL);\n    }\n}\n...\nvoid OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(const char *Str, size_t DataLen)\n{\n    ssize_t WriteLen;\n\n    while (DataLen > 0)\n    {\n        /* writes the raw data directly to STDOUT_FILENO (unbuffered) */\n        WriteLen = write(STDOUT_FILENO, Str, DataLen);\n        if (WriteLen <= 0)\n        {\n            /* no recourse if this fails, just stop. */\n            break;\n        }\n        Str += WriteLen;\n        DataLen -= WriteLen;\n    }\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nstatus = pthread_mutex_lock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\nif (status < 0)\n{\n    BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_lock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n}\nelse\n{\n    /*\n     * Temporarily Disable/Defer thread cancellation.\n     * Note that OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl() calls write() which is a cancellation point.\n     * So if this calling task is canceled, it risks leaving the BSP locked.\n     */\n    pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState);\n}\n\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The code is not dead: the conditional distinguishes error and success paths so pthread_setcancelstate() is only called on successful lock. BSP_DEBUG is defined empty, so the error branch contains no side-effects in this build, but that is an intentional, build-time choice for diagnostic output and does not constitute dead code under MISRA 2.2 (unreachable code is excluded and the conditional affects control flow)."
