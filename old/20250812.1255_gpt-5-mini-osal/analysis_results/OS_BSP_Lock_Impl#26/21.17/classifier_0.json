  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The call is to strerror(status) which does not accept user-supplied pointer parameters to be written into, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (which targets string-handling functions that could access user buffers such as memcpy/strcpy/strcat/etc.) is not triggered here. A concrete violating scenario would be, for example, copying the returned message into a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking, e.g. char buf[16]; strcpy(buf, strerror(status)); \u2014 this could cause an out-of-bounds access and would violate Rule 21.17."
