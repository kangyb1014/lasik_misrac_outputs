  "explanation": "- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t: The target function declares a pointer of this type (OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *impl). You must see the struct/typedef to know the types and const-qualification of its members (in particular the 'mutex' member) to decide whether the pointer could/should be to a const-qualified object.\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table: The function reads impl from this table (impl = OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype]). The table's declaration reveals whether its element type is a pointer to const or non-const (e.g. OS_impl_objtype_lock_t * const[], const OS_impl_objtype_lock_t *[], etc.), which directly affects whether impl is already const-qualified and whether changing impl to point-to-const is possible.\n- pthread_mutex_lock: The prototype (from pthread.h) is required to determine the parameter type (pthread_mutex_t *). Because pthread_mutex_lock takes a non-const pointer, passing &impl->mutex prevents impl being a pointer-to-const; the prototype is needed to prove this incompatibility under MISRA guidance.\n- pthread_mutex_t: Knowing the exact typedef/definition for pthread_mutex_t (or at least that it is a modifiable type) clarifies whether the mutex is inherently mutable and thus requires a non-const pointer when passed to locking functions.\n- osal_objtype_t: The index type used to access the table. Its definition (enum/typedef) can show whether implicit casts/constness or indexing semantics affect how the table is declared/used; include it to fully analyze the expression OS_impl_objtype_lock_table[idtype] and any const-qualified table declarations."
