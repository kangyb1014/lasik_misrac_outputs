  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types. The fragments above contain the function's pointer declaration and all places that obtain/use that pointer (assignment from the global table, taking the address of a member, and the call that consumes a string pointer). Other lines do not introduce pointer types that could/should be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for this rule: the function parameter (osal_objtype_t idtype) is not a pointer; the local integer declaration (int ret;) is not a pointer; the NULL-check (if (impl != NULL)) and the surrounding control flow contain no pointer type declarations; the strerror call is used only as an argument in the debug print (handled above). No other pointer declarations or pointer-to-object uses appear in this function that would be candidates for const qualification under Rule 8.13."
