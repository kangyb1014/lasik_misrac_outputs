  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_Lock_Global_Impl (directly or indirectly) uses memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect the implementations/definitions that the function references:\n\n- OS_DEBUG (macro/function): The call OS_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_lock(&impl->mutex): %s\", strerror(ret)); may expand to logging code that performs string comparisons. If OS_DEBUG is a macro or function in the project, its body must be checked for any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\n- strerror (C library): strerror returns a pointer to an error string; an application may rely on its behavior or a project-provided replacement of strerror may exist. If the project supplies its own implementation of strerror (or a wrapper), that implementation must be inspected for memcmp usages that compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_table (global array): The global table could be initialized or wrapped by code that performs string comparisons (e.g., name lookups). Inspect its definition/initializers and any accessors for memcmp usage on C strings.\n\n- OS_impl_objtype_lock_t (type/struct definition): The structure definition (and any associated inline helpers or accessor macros) must be checked; helper functions/macros tied to this type could perform string comparisons using memcmp.\n\n- osal_objtype_t (typedef/enum): Inspect this type and any conversion/utility functions that operate on it (e.g., name mapping functions) because those helpers may perform string comparisons with memcmp.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock (libpthread): If the project links against or replaces pthread_mutex_lock with a compatibility wrapper, that wrapper must be checked. The standard library implementation is not usually part of MISRA checks for application code, but any project-provided wrapper or reimplementation must be inspected for memcmp use on null-terminated strings.\n\nOnly these symbols are necessary to follow the data/control flow from the target function to any code that might perform string comparisons; inspect their definitions/implementations to see whether memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
