  "explanation": "No unreachable code was identified in the provided fragments. OS_Lock_Global_Impl contains a simple sequence: table lookup, a null check, and an attempt to lock the mutex only when impl != NULL \u2014 both the true and false outcomes of the if-statement are reachable at run time (e.g. OS_OBJECT_TYPE_UNDEFINED yields impl == NULL; other valid object types yield non-NULL pointers). The initializer for OS_impl_objtype_lock_table contains explicit entries (including a NULL for the undefined type), which does not introduce any statically unreachable statements. Note that there are other potential concerns (out-of-bounds indexing if idtype can be invalid, use of strerror with a pthread error code) but these are runtime/UB or API-usage issues rather than examples of unreachable code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1, so they do not warrant marking fragments as unreachable."
