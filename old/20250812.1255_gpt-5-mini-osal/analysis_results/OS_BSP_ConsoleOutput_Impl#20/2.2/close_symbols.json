  "explanation": "To determine whether OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl is dead code (i.e., removal would not affect program behaviour) you must establish whether the function can actually be reached and whether calls to it have observable effects. The listed symbols are required for that reachability/behaviour analysis:\n\n- write: The target function invokes the system call write. You need its prototype/semantics to confirm the function has observable side-effects (I/O) and to reason about error conditions that may affect control flow and timing (relevant to behaviour). If write is stubbed-out or removed by configuration, the effect of removing the target function may differ.\n\n- STDOUT_FILENO: The file-descriptor macro determines where write sends data. If STDOUT_FILENO is remapped or disabled by platform configuration, calls may be inert; knowing its definition is necessary to determine observable effect.\n\n- OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl: Direct caller of OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl. You must inspect its implementation to see under what conditions it calls the BSP console output (always, conditionally, behind compile-time/runtime guards, or via function-pointer indirection). This is central to deciding reachability and whether removal changes behaviour.\n\n- OS_ConsoleTask_Entry, OS_ConsoleWrite: Callers of OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl (from the static graph). These higher-level entry points are needed to determine whether OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl itself is reachable at runtime (e.g., whether the console task is created/started or OS_ConsoleWrite is used by the system). Reachability from system startup or main affects whether the BSP console output is live code.\n\n- UT_BSP_DoText, UT_BSP_EndTest: Other direct callers of OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl. Their implementations must be examined to see when and how they call the target (e.g., only in unit-test builds, behind conditional compilation, or as part of normal runtime). If these are only used in test builds that are not present in production, the target might be dead in production builds.\n\n- UtAssert_DoReport, UtAssert_DoTestSegmentReport, UtAssert_EndTest, UtAssert_Abort, UtAssert_Message, UtMessage, UtPrintx, UT_BSP_Setup, UT_BSP_StartTestSegment: Callers of UT_BSP_DoText (from the static graph). These symbols represent the testing/runtime code path that may propagate to UT_BSP_DoText and thus to OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl. You need them to determine if test/reporting paths are executed in the deployed system or only in special/test configurations.\n\n- UtTest_Run: Caller of UT_BSP_EndTest (from the static graph). This is a higher-level test runner entry point; inspecting it (and where/when it is invoked) helps determine whether UT_BSP_EndTest (and thus the target) is reachable.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst trace upward from the target function to system entry points (or confirm they are only invoked in test builds), determine conditional compilation or runtime guards, and confirm whether calls produce observable effects (via write/STDOUT) \u2014 all necessary to assess if removing OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl would alter program behaviour (i.e., whether it is dead code)."
