  "scenario": "The identifier 'ssize_t' is a POSIX typedef (typically provided via <sys/types.h> or <unistd.h>), not a compiler language extension. Rule 1.2 forbids compiler language extensions explicitly documented as such; using ssize_t is a platform/API type, not a language extension. Ensure the appropriate POSIX headers are included for portability, but this does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
