  "explanation": "All other code constructs in this function are standard ISO C and do not appear to rely on compiler language extensions: the function signature (void OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(const char *, size_t)), use of size_t, the while loop, if check, pointer arithmetic (Str += WriteLen), subtraction (DataLen -= WriteLen), break, and return type void are all standard C. The only items that require further investigation are those that reference POSIX/platform-specific APIs or types (ssize_t, write(), STDOUT_FILENO); everything else is ordinary, portable C and therefore need not be investigated for Rule 1.2."
