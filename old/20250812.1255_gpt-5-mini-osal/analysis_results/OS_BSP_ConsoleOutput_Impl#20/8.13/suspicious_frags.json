  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in the function is the parameter Str, which is declared as const char * (so the pointed-to type is const-qualified). Passing Str to write is appropriate because write accepts a const void *. Modifying the pointer value (Str += WriteLen) does not affect the const qualification of the pointed-to object and is allowed. There are no other pointer variables or pointer-to-non-const usages in this function that would warrant investigation under Rule 8.13."
