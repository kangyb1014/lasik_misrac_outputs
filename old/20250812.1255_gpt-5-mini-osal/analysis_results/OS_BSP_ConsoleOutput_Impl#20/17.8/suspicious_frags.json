  "explanation": "The two listed fragments are the only places in the function that modify function parameters (the pointer parameter Str and the integer parameter DataLen) and therefore require investigation against MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Other code in the function does not modify parameters: WriteLen is a local variable; the while (DataLen > 0) test only reads DataLen; the call to write(...) uses the parameters but does not modify them; the assignment to WriteLen and the break statement affect only local control flow or local storage. The pointer\u2019s referent is declared const (const char *), so there are no writes to the pointed-to object in this function. Thus no other fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
