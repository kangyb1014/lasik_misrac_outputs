  "explanation": "The fragments above should be investigated for possible unreachable-code issues or logic that causes parts of the loop to never execute: - The entire while loop body may be effectively never entered if OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE (StaticSym) is NULL; this makes the loop body unreachable at runtime and causes the initial return_code (OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) to be returned. - The ++StaticSym; increment can be skipped by the break statements; verify that this isn't masking logic errors or causing later iterations to be unreachable. - The composite condition using the logical OR with ModuleName (ModuleName == NULL || strcmp(...)) relies on short-circuiting; the strcmp on StaticSym->Module will never be executed when ModuleName is NULL \u2014 this is intended but should be checked to ensure no other path makes that strcmp impossible/unreachable or causes undefined behavior. - The strcmp comparing StaticSym->Name could be unreachable if entries are malformed (e.g., Name == NULL not handled elsewhere) or if the loop is never entered. Other code in the function (initialization of return_code and StaticSym, the assignments to *SymbolAddress and return_code when a symbol is found, and the final return) are normal control-flow constructs and are reachable depending on runtime inputs; there are no constant conditions, unconditional returns preceding reachable statements, or obvious dead-code constructs in those lines that would warrant investigation under MISRA C Rule 2.1."
