  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. All statements in the loop are reachable depending on runtime data: the while loop executes only when StaticSym != NULL; the first if (Name == NULL) handles a sentinel and breaks out; the strcmp-based branch is reachable when the symbol matches; and the ++StaticSym advances the scan. There are no statements that cannot be reached at runtime, so Rule 2.1 is not violated."
