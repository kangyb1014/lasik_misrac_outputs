  "explanation": "- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: This global/pointer is the loop entry source. To determine if any iteration of the while-loop (and therefore the inner branches) can ever execute you must know the actual value or initializer of this symbol (e.g., whether it is NULL, points to an empty table, or to an array terminated by a Name==NULL sentinel). If this is a compile-time constant (for some build/config) it can make large parts of the function provably unreachable.\n- The static symbol-table object that OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE points to (its array/object initializer): Knowing the table contents (whether there exists an entry with Name==NULL as a terminator, whether any entry can match SymbolName, etc.) is required to prove reachability of the two inner branches: the Name==NULL end-of-list branch and the found-symbol branch that sets *SymbolAddress and returns OS_SUCCESS.\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t (struct definition): Required to understand the layout and semantics of StaticSym->Name, ->Module and ->Address, and to ensure ++StaticSym advances to the next logical record (i.e., that the table is an array of this struct). This affects whether the Name==NULL sentinel technique is valid and whether the loop can progress to a terminator, which is necessary to prove or disprove reachability.\n- strcmp (declaration/semantics): While strcmp is a standard pure comparison, its semantics (returns 0 when strings are equal) are needed to reason about the condition that leads to the \"found matching symbol\" branch. Including strcmp confirms there are no hidden side effects that could affect reachability."
