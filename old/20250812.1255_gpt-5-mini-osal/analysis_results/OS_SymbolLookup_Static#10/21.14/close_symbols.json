  "explanation": "To decide if this function violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must confirm that no memcmp call is used (directly or indirectly) to compare the Name/Module strings. Each symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- strcmp: The function calls strcmp. You need the actual strcmp symbol/implementation (or its linkage) to verify whether strcmp is implemented using memcmp internally or replaced by a wrapper that uses memcmp. If strcmp is a thin wrapper around memcmp then the rule could be violated despite the source showing strcmp.\n\n- memcmp: Inspecting memcmp (implementation or references) is required to detect whether any of the string comparison paths resolve to memcmp. If strcmp (or any alias/wrapper) uses memcmp, that is the exact violation the rule forbids.\n\n- any strcmp macro/alias/wrapper definitions: Projects sometimes #define or provide an inline function that replaces strcmp (for optimization or portability). You must check for any macro, inline, or wrapper named strcmp (or alternative names) that could call memcmp. This symbol group covers such redefinitions/aliases.\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t (definition of fields: Name, Module, Address): You must confirm the types of the Name and Module fields (e.g., char * vs. fixed-length buffers) and any documented guarantees about null-termination. The MISRA rule applies to null-terminated strings; if these fields are not null-terminated strings, then the use of memcmp could be acceptable or the strcmp usage might be inappropriate. Knowing the struct layout and semantics is therefore necessary.\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE (initializer / definition of the static table entries): The table initializer can show how Name/Module entries are created (string literals, pointers to buffers, or binary addresses). This helps confirm that the entries are null-terminated strings and that the code path performing strcmp is indeed comparing C-style null-terminated strings (which is the scope of the MISRA prohibition on memcmp)."
