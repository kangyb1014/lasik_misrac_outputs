  "scenario": "The call strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) is made without checking SymbolName for NULL. If OS_SymbolLookup_Static is called with SymbolName == NULL, strcmp will dereference that NULL pointer (or otherwise read beyond the bounds of the object), causing undefined behavior. (Note: StaticSym->Name is checked for NULL earlier, but there is no check that either pointer actually points to a NUL-terminated string.)"
