If OS_SymbolLookup_Static is called with SymbolName == NULL, strcmp will dereference that NULL pointer (or otherwise read beyond the bounds of the object), causing undefined behavior. (Note: StaticSym->Name is checked for NULL earlier, but there is no check that either pointer actually points to a NUL-terminated string.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_SymbolLookup_Static_log_probe(const char *stage, OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym, const char *SymbolName, const char *ModuleName)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/87.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Print the stage, pointer values and NULL flags.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The code calls strcmp(StaticSym->Name, SymbolName) without validating SymbolName. If OS_SymbolLookup_Static is invoked with SymbolName == NULL (or with a non\u2013NUL-terminated buffer), the strcmp call will dereference/read through an invalid pointer and thus can access memory beyond the bounds of the referenced object, which is exactly what MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 prohibits. Note: StaticSym->Name is checked for NULL earlier (so that particular pointer isn\u2019t NULL), and the ModuleName branch guards the second strcmp by testing ModuleName == NULL first, but there is no corresponding guard for SymbolName. (If the function\u2019s API formally requires SymbolName to be a non-NULL NUL-terminated string, that precondition must be documented and enforced by callers; otherwise the implementation should validate SymbolName before calling strcmp.)"
