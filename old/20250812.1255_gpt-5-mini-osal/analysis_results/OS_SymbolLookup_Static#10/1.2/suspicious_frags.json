  "explanation": "No explicit compiler language extensions are present in the provided code fragment. Specifically:\n\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm, __declspec, __typeof__, __extension__, statement-expressions, or other documented compiler extensions.\n- Control-flow constructs (while, break), pointer arithmetic (++StaticSym), and use of standard library function strcmp are all standard C.\n- The typedefs and macros shown (int32, cpuaddr, OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE) are standard C mechanisms; none of their uses in the function invoke language extensions. If the macro OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE or OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE itself (not shown) expands to a compiler-specific extension, that expansion would need separate review, but the code shown does not contain such an expansion.\n- The cast of a function pointer to an integer type ((cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address) is implementation-defined behavior in C (and can be a portability concern), but it is not a compiler language extension as described in compiler documentation and therefore does not by itself trigger MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 as specified in your brief.\n\nBecause of the above, there are no code fragments in the supplied function that should be reported for use of documented compiler language extensions."
