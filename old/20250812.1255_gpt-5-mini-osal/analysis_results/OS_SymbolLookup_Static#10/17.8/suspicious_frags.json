  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in a way that violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The parameters are: cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName, and const char *ModuleName. The code performs a write through the pointer parameter via '*SymbolAddress = ...' \u2014 this modifies the object pointed to (which the rule allows) but does not modify the pointer SymbolAddress itself. There are no assignments or pointer arithmetic applied to SymbolAddress, SymbolName, or ModuleName (they are only read or compared). The increment of StaticSym (++StaticSym) affects a local pointer variable, not a function parameter. The macro OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE simply aliases a symbol table and does not change parameter usage. Therefore there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for Rule 17.8."
