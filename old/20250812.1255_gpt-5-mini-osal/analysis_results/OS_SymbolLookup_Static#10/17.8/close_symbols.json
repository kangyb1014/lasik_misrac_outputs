  "explanation": "- cpuaddr (typedef): Required to know whether cpuaddr is an integer type or a pointer type. This determines the exact types involved in the assignment \"*SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address\" and helps confirm that the code is modifying the object pointed to by SymbolAddress (allowed) rather than reassigning the SymbolAddress parameter itself (disallowed).\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t (struct): Needed to inspect the types of the struct members and understand what StaticSym->Address is. The struct definition clarifies whether Address is compatible with cpuaddr and whether any implicit pointer/aliasing issues could cause the parameter pointer to be modified.\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t.Name: The Name member's type (e.g., const char * vs char *) is needed to verify that comparisons via strcmp do not modify the SymbolName parameter and to reason about const-correctness.\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t.Module: Same as Name \u2014 its type is needed to confirm that the ModuleName parameter is not being modified by the comparisons.\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t.Address: Its type is required to confirm what value is being stored into *SymbolAddress and to ensure that this is a modification of the pointee (allowed) and not of the pointer parameter itself.\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: The declaration/definition (e.g., array or pointer) is required to understand the initialization of the local pointer StaticSym and to ensure that operations on StaticSym (such as ++StaticSym) do not alias or mutate the incoming pointer parameters.\n- strcmp (string.h prototype): The prototype (takes const char *) is needed to confirm that the calls to strcmp do not modify the string arguments (SymbolName, ModuleName) and therefore do not constitute modification of pointer parameters.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether the function assigns to or otherwise modifies the pointer parameters themselves (which would violate the MISRA rule) versus only modifying the objects they point to (which is permitted)."
