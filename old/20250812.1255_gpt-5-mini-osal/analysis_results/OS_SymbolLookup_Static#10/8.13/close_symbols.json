  "explanation": "- OS_static_symbol_record_t: The struct definition (and in particular the exact types of the members Name, Module and Address) is required to determine if the pointer members are declared with const (e.g. const char *Name, const char *Module, const void *Address) or plain pointers. The MISRA rule concerns whether these member pointer types should be const-qualified.\\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: The declaration/definition of this symbol (type and any const qualification) is needed because the function initializes a non-const pointer variable (OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym) from this symbol. If the table/source is intended to be const (e.g. const OS_static_symbol_record_t [] or const OS_static_symbol_record_t *), that affects whether the current code drops const qualification and thus violates the rule.\\n- strcmp (string.h prototype): The prototype (int strcmp(const char *, const char *)) is needed to confirm the parameter types are const char * so that passing StaticSym->Name and StaticSym->Module to strcmp does not hide a missing const qualification on those struct members.\\n- cpuaddr (typedef): The typedef of cpuaddr and the type of the Address field are required to check the cast '*SymbolAddress = (cpuaddr)StaticSym->Address;'. If Address is a pointer with const qualification (e.g. const void *) and cpuaddr is an integer type, this cast may discard constness or otherwise interact with pointer const rules; knowing cpuaddr and Address types is necessary to assess any const-related violation."
