  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment 'if (StaticSym->Name == NULL)' only tests a pointer for NULL and does not call any <string.h> functions, so it cannot by itself cause out-of-bounds accesses from string handling functions. Note: the surrounding code does call strcmp; a Rule 21.17 violation would occur if strcmp is invoked with a NULL pointer or with a pointer to a non\u2011null\u2011terminated or otherwise out\u2011of\u2011bounds buffer (for example, if ModuleName == NULL or StaticSym->Module does not point to a valid NUL-terminated string). The while loop already ensures StaticSym is not NULL before the dereference, so the fragment is safe with respect to 21.17."
