  "explanation": "The only use of a <string.h> function in this function is strcmp; any code that provides or advances the pointers passed to strcmp or that determines loop termination must be inspected for possible out-of-bounds or NULL-pointer cases. No other lines in the function call or use functions from <string.h> or perform further string operations, so they do not need investigation for Rule 21.17. The remaining statements (initialization of return_code, the break/return statements, comments, and the surrounding control-flow braces) do not invoke string handling and therefore are not relevant to this MISRA C 2023 rule check."
