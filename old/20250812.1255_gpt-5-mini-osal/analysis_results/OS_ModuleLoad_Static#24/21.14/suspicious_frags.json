  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the supplied code. The code uses strcmp to compare null-terminated strings, and it checks StaticSym->Module != NULL before calling strcmp, avoiding passing NULL to the string comparison function. The other pointer comparisons (StaticSym->Name == NULL, StaticSym->Module != NULL) are null-pointer checks, not string comparisons. Therefore there are no fragments requiring investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
