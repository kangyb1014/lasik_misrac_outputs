  "explanation": "1) OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE\n   - This is the initial value assigned to StaticSym and therefore determines whether the while loop (while (StaticSym != NULL)) is ever entered. To decide if any part of the loop body is unreachable you must know whether this symbol can be NULL at runtime or always points to a valid table/array and how that table is initialized (e.g. presence/absence of a sentinel entry). If it is always NULL the entire loop body would be unreachable; if it always points to a one-element table with Name==NULL the inner code after the first check would be unreachable, etc.\n\n2) OS_static_symbol_record_t\n   - The function depends on the structure members Name and Module and performs pointer arithmetic (++StaticSym) to advance to the next record. To reason about reachability you need the type layout and semantics: whether records are stored as an array terminated by a sentinel (Name == NULL), whether Name/Module are pointers, and whether ++StaticSym advances to the next logical record. This is required to determine if the Name==NULL break condition can ever be reached and whether subsequent loop iterations (and thus the strcmp path) are reachable.\n\n(Additional standard symbols such as strcmp/NULL and the return-code macros are not required to determine reachability of the loop/branches; the two symbols above are sufficient to decide whether the loop body or particular branches can be executed.)"
