  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: the function parameter declaration (const char *ModuleName) already points to a const-qualified type; the usages of StaticSym->Name and StaticSym->Module (comparisons with NULL and use in strcmp) do not modify pointed-to objects and their member types are const-qualified; the pointer increment (++StaticSym) modifies the pointer variable itself, not the pointee, so it is not a violation of the rule; return_code and other control-flow statements are unrelated to pointer qualification. The three reported fragments are the only locations where the effective pointer qualification or its hiding by a typedef/macro may warrant further inspection under Rule 8.13."
