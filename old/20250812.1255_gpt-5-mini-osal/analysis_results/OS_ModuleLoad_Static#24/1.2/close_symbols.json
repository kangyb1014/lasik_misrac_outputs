  "explanation": "For determining whether any compiler language extensions are used in OS_ModuleLoad_Static you must inspect the definitions that could hide such extensions (attributes, compiler builtins, section/linker tricks, nonstandard keywords). Reason for each symbol:\n\n- OS_static_symbol_record_t: The struct/type definition (including the types of its members Name and Module) may carry compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__((section,packed,aligned)), MSVC declspecs, or uses of nonstandard types/keywords). Inspecting this prevents missing extensions applied to the type or its fields.\n\n- OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE: This symbol's definition or macro expansion could be a compiler/linker extension (e.g. a linker-provided symbol, placement in a custom section via __attribute__((section)), or other nonstandard construct). You must see its declaration/definition to detect such extensions.\n\n- int32: This typedef/alias must be checked because its definition may use nonstandard integer typedefs or compiler-specific keywords (e.g. signed long __attribute__(...), or rely on nonstandard headers). Confirm it is a standard typedef (or from stdint.h) and not an extension.\n\n- OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND and OS_SUCCESS: These macros/enums may be defined using compiler-specific constructs or expressions (macros that expand to builtin functions, attributes, or use of nonstandard token pasting). Their definitions should be inspected for extensions.\n\n- strcmp (declaration): Although strcmp is a standard C library function, the identifier could be macro-redirected or mapped to a compiler builtin or inline asm in the local headers. Check its declaration/definition to ensure no compiler-specific replacement is in effect.\n\n- NULL (macro): The NULL definition in the translation unit could be nonstandard (for example, defined in a way that uses compiler-specific casts or keywords). Verify the NULL macro used here is the standard definition.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their typedefs, macros, declarations, and any attributes or compiler-specific annotations) lets you determine if the function relies on language/compiler extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
