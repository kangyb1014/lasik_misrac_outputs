  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp are present in the provided function OS_ModuleLoad_Impl or the related code snippets. There are no direct calls to memcmp, nor any macros that expand to memcmp. The code uses dlopen/dlerror, vsnprintf, and an empty OS_DEBUG macro; none of these perform string comparisons with memcmp. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (prohibition of memcmp for null-terminated strings) in the supplied code. If other translation units exist outside the provided snippets, they were not available for review and could still contain memcmp uses, but based on the given code nothing needs investigation for this rule."
