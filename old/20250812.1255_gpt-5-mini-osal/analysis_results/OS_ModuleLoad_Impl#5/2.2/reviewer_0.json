At call sites like OS_DEBUG(\"Error loading shared library: %s\\n\", dlerror()); the macro expansion produces an empty statement (the trailing semicolon becomes a lone ';'), which executes no operation. Removing that statement (or the macro call) would not affect program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Example: in OS_ModuleLoad_Impl the OS_DEBUG(...) call becomes a no-op and is therefore dead code.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = NULL;\n    va_list ap;\n\n    /* Ensure directory exists; ignore errors other than unexpected ones */\n    if (mkdir(\"/tmp/logs\", 0777) != 0 && errno != EEXIST)\n    {\n        /* If we can't create the directory, still attempt to open the file. */\n    }\n\n    f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/42.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return; /* Best-effort logging only */\n    }\n\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n    fputc('\\n', f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_ModuleLoad_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *translated_path)\n{\n    int32                             status = OS_ERROR;\n    int                               dl_mode;\n    OS_impl_module_internal_record_t *impl;\n    OS_module_internal_record_t *     module;\n\n    impl   = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_module_table, *token);\n    module = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_module_table, *token);\n\n    /* Probe: record entry and basic state */\n    probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad_Impl ENTRY: token=%p translated_path=%s\", (const void *)token, translated_path ? translated_path : \"(null)\");\n\n    /*\n     * RTLD_NOW should instruct dlopen() to resolve all the symbols in the\n     * module immediately, as opposed to waiting until they are used.\n     * The latter (lazy mode) is non-deterministic - a resolution error on\n     * a rarely-used symbol could cause a random failure far in the future.\n     */\n    dl_mode = RTLD_NOW;\n\n    if ((module->flags & OS_MODULE_FLAG_LOCAL_SYMBOLS) != 0)\n    {\n        /*\n         * Do not add the symbols in this module to the global symbol table.\n         * This mode helps prevent any unanticipated references into this\n         * module, which can in turn prevent unloading via dlclose().\n         */\n        dl_mode |= RTLD_LOCAL;\n        probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad_Impl: using RTLD_LOCAL (flags=0x%x)\", module->flags);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * Default mode - add symbols to the global symbol table, so they\n         * will be available to resolve symbols in future module loads.\n         * However, any such references will prevent unloading of this\n         * module via dlclose().\n         */\n        dl_mode |= RTLD_GLOBAL;\n        probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad_Impl: using RTLD_GLOBAL (flags=0x%x)\", module->flags);\n    }\n\n    /* Clear any previous dlerror state, as in the original code */\n    dlerror();\n\n    probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad_Impl: calling dlopen('%s', mode=0x%x)\", translated_path ? translated_path : \"(null)\", dl_mode);\n    impl->dl_handle = dlopen(translated_path, dl_mode);\n    if (impl->dl_handle != NULL)\n    {\n        status = OS_SUCCESS;\n        probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad_Impl: dlopen succeeded, handle=%p\", impl->dl_handle);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Capture the dlerror message for logging and for reproducing the scenario */\n        const char *err = dlerror();\n        probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad_Impl: dlopen failed, dlerror='%s'\", err ? err : \"(null)\");\n\n        /* Original code reported the error via OS_DEBUG; keep behavior and add probe log instead */\n        /* OS_DEBUG(\"Error loading shared library: %s\\n\", dlerror()); */\n    }\n\n    probe_log(\"OS_ModuleLoad_Impl EXIT: status=%d\", status);\n\n    return status;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_ModuleLoad_Impl.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA 2.2 targets executed operations in the built program whose removal would not change behaviour. When OS_DEBUG is defined away, the source-level call becomes a null statement that generates no code (no executed operation) in the object program. There is therefore no runtime dead operation to remove \u2014 the logging was conditionally compiled out by the macro, not compiled into a no-effect executable operation. The empty source-level ';' is not an executed operation in the final program and so does not meet the intent of Rule 2.2. (If the macro were implemented so it produced an actual no-op instruction in the binary, or if it invoked a function that had no observable effects, then a rule-2.2 consideration might apply; but that is not the scenario described.)"
