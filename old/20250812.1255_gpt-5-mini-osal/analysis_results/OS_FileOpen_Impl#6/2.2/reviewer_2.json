Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of OS_FileOpen_Impl.\n```c\nint32 OS_FileOpen_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path, int32 flags, int32 access_mode)\n{\n    int                             os_perm;\n    int                             os_mode;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n    ** Check for a valid access mode\n    ** For creating a file, OS_READ_ONLY does not make sense\n    */\n    switch (access_mode)\n    {\n        case OS_WRITE_ONLY:\n            os_perm = O_WRONLY;\n            break;\n        case OS_READ_ONLY:\n            os_perm = O_RDONLY;\n            break;\n        case OS_READ_WRITE:\n            os_perm = O_RDWR;\n            break;\n        default:\n            return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    if (flags & OS_FILE_FLAG_CREATE)\n    {\n        os_perm |= O_CREAT;\n    }\n    if (flags & OS_FILE_FLAG_TRUNCATE)\n    {\n        os_perm |= O_TRUNC;\n    }\n\n    os_perm |= OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS;\n\n    os_mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH;\n\n    impl->fd = open(local_path, os_perm, os_mode);\n\n    if (impl->fd < 0)\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"open(%s): %s\\n\", local_path, strerror(errno));\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If the flags included O_NONBLOCK, then\n     * enable the \"select\" call on this handle.\n     */\n    impl->selectable = ((os_perm & O_NONBLOCK) != 0);\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The OS_DEBUG invocation is defined as an empty macro (#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)). After preprocessing the statement becomes an empty statement (no runtime effect).

  "explanation": "The report is not correct for the scenario as stated. MISRA 2.2 targets executed operations that could be removed without changing behaviour. If OS_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro (#define OS_DEBUG(...)) the invocation is removed at preprocessing and no code is generated or executed, so there is no executed, effectless operation to classify as dead code. (Arguments such as strerror() are not evaluated when the macro expands to nothing.)\n\nNote the practical caveat: if, in the project configuration, OS_DEBUG is defined as an explicit no-op expression that is still present in the translation unit (for example #define OS_DEBUG(...) ((void)0)), that yields an executed expression-statement with no effect and could be considered dead code under Rule 2.2 and should be reviewed/removed. Determination of a violation therefore depends on the actual macro definition in the build; with the empty-macro case described by agent A the claim of a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
