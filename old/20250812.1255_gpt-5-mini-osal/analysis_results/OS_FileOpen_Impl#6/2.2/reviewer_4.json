Its removal would not change program behaviour, so this executed operation is dead code in that project configuration (if the constant is zero).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_FileOpen_Log(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/50.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    fputc('\\n', f);\n    fclose(f);\n}\n\nint32 OS_FileOpen_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token, const char *local_path, int32 flags, int32 access_mode)\n{\n    int                             os_perm;\n    int                             os_mode;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *impl;\n\n    impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token);\n\n    /*\n    ** Check for a valid access mode\n    ** For creating a file, OS_READ_ONLY does not make sense\n    */\n    switch (access_mode)\n    {\n        case OS_WRITE_ONLY:\n            os_perm = O_WRONLY;\n            break;\n        case OS_READ_ONLY:\n            os_perm = O_RDONLY;\n            break;\n        case OS_READ_WRITE:\n            os_perm = O_RDWR;\n            break;\n        default:\n            return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    if (flags & OS_FILE_FLAG_CREATE)\n    {\n        os_perm |= O_CREAT;\n    }\n    if (flags & OS_FILE_FLAG_TRUNCATE)\n    {\n        os_perm |= O_TRUNC;\n    }\n\n    /* Log state before applying OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS */\n    OS_FileOpen_Log(\"OS_FileOpen_Impl ENTER: path='%s' flags=0x%X access_mode=%d impl=%p os_perm_before=0x%X OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS=0x%X\",\n                    local_path, (unsigned int)flags, (int)access_mode, (void *)impl, (unsigned int)os_perm, (unsigned int)OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS);\n\n    os_perm |= OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS;\n\n    /* Log state after applying OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS */\n    OS_FileOpen_Log(\"OS_FileOpen_Impl AFTER_IMPL_FLAGS: path='%s' os_perm_after=0x%X\",\n                    local_path, (unsigned int)os_perm);\n\n    os_mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH;\n\n    impl->fd = open(local_path, os_perm, os_mode);\n\n    if (impl->fd < 0)\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"open(%s): %s\\n\", local_path, strerror(errno));\n        OS_FileOpen_Log(\"OS_FileOpen_Impl OPEN_FAILED: path='%s' fd=%d errno=%d (%s)\",\n                        local_path, impl->fd, errno, strerror(errno));\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * If the flags included O_NONBLOCK, then\n     * enable the \"select\" call on this handle.\n     */\n    impl->selectable = ((os_perm & O_NONBLOCK) != 0);\n\n    /* Final log with resulting fd and selectable state */\n    OS_FileOpen_Log(\"OS_FileOpen_Impl SUCCESS: path='%s' fd=%d selectable=%d os_perm=0x%X\",\n                    local_path, impl->fd, (int)impl->selectable, (unsigned int)os_perm);\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for OS_FileOpen_Impl.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. With OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS defined as 0 in the project configuration, the statement\n\n    os_perm |= OS_IMPL_REGULAR_FILE_FLAGS;\n\nis an executed operation that has no effect on the program state (it leaves os_perm unchanged). Removing that statement would not change program behaviour, so it meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If the macro were nonzero or had side effects, the statement would not be dead; but under the provided project configuration the claim is valid.)"
