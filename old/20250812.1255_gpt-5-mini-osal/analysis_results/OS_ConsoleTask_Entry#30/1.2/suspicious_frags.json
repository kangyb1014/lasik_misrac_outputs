  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. Specifically:\n- No vendor-specific keywords or attributes (for example, no __attribute__, __declspec, typeof, __extension__, __asm__, __builtin_* or similar) are present.\n- No nested functions, statement-expressions, or GCC/Clang-specific expression extensions are used.\n- The union-based wrapper (OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t) and accessing a different union member is standard C (implementation-defined behavior), not a compiler extension; the cppcheck comment is a static-analysis directive, not a language extension.\n- The sem_wait call and POSIX APIs are platform libraries, not language extensions.\n- The macro OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET and its use are ordinary preprocessor usage, not an extension.\n- There are no #pragma directives or other vendor-specific preprocessing extensions.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 (language extensions should not be used)."
