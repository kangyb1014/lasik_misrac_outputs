  "explanation": "For assessing whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA check), the next analyst must inspect the surrounding type and macro definitions and any compiler-specific annotations that could be extensions. Each listed symbol is required for the following reasons:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: The function casts Addr->AddrData to this accessor type and then references members (sa, sa_in, sa_in6). Its full definition is needed to verify whether it uses anonymous structs/unions, unnamed bitfields, or other nonstandard constructs (anonymous members are sometimes compiler extensions).\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: The source Addr parameter is of this type. Its definition (especially the AddrData member) is needed to confirm whether AddrData is standard (no implementation-defined layout/attributes) and whether the cast in the function relies on nonstandard layout or extensions.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t::AddrData: The exact type and declaration of AddrData are needed to ensure the pointer cast is to a compatible/standard object and not depending on compiler-specific padding, alignment, or extension-based overlaying of members.\n\n- struct sockaddr (sa) definition: Accessor->sa.sa_family is used in the switch. The sockaddr member definition must be checked for anonymous members or extension attributes.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in (sa_in) definition: The code takes &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr; the definition must be examined for nonstandard fields or compiler-specific extensions (e.g., anonymous unions/structs, attributes on members).\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (sa_in6) definition: Same reason as sockaddr_in for the IPv6 branch (and to detect anonymous/extension usages in that struct).\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: These macros/constants are used in case labels. Their definitions must be checked to ensure they are ordinary integer macros/constants and not implemented via compiler extensions or unusual constructs.\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6: This conditional compilation macro controls presence of the AF_INET6 case. Its definition determines whether the code depends on platform-specific extension behavior or nonportable compilation paths.\n\n- inet_ntop (declaration/prototype): Verify that inet_ntop is a standard library function or simple macro; confirm it is not provided via a compiler extension (e.g., inline/attribute variants) and check its prototype for any nonstandard attributes that the call might rely on.\n\n- int32 (typedef): The function return type uses int32. Its typedef must be checked to ensure it is a standard typedef (e.g., typedef int32_t int32) and not a compiler-specific type/keyword (e.g., __int32) that would be a language extension.\n\n- size_t (typedef): Confirm size_t is the standard definition (from stddef.h) and not redefined using nonstandard/compiler-specific mechanisms.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: The return value macros/constants must be inspected to ensure they are plain integer macros/enums, not compiler-specific constructs (attributes, decorated constants, or extension-based types).\n\n- compiler-extension markers (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, __asm__, __inline__, typeof): In addition to the named types/macros, the header files that define the above symbols must be scanned for common compiler-specific extension tokens. Presence of these tokens in the definitions of the types or macros used by the function would indicate use of language extensions that MISRA requires to be reported.\n\nCollectively, these symbols and tokens allow the next analyst to determine whether the code uses anonymous/implementation-defined/extension constructs or relies on compiler-specific keywords/attributes; without inspecting them one cannot conclude compliance with the MISRA rule about language extensions."
