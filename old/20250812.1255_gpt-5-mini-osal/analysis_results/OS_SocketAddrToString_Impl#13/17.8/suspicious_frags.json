  "explanation": "No code fragments modify any function parameter itself. Details:\n- The only pointer parameters are 'buffer' and 'Addr'. There is no assignment to the parameter variables (no statements like 'buffer = ...' or 'Addr = ...'). Only a local pointer variable 'Accessor' is assigned; this does not modify the parameter.\n- The call to inet_ntop writes into the object pointed to by 'buffer' (buffer contents), which is explicitly allowed by the rule: the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified.\n- 'buflen' is a value parameter (size_t) and is not modified.\n- The code reads members of '*Addr' and takes the address of Addr->AddrData to create a local const pointer; this is a read-only access and does not modify the parameter or the pointed-to object (the cast preserves const). \n- No other statements (returns, switch, case, break) alter any parameter.\nTherefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing needs to be investigated for this rule."
