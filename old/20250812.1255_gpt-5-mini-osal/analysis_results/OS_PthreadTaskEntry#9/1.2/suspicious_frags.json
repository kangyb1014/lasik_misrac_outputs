  "explanation": "I did not find any use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specifically:\n- There are no compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __asm, __builtin_*, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }) used as expressions, nested functions, vector types, or other known GCC/MSVC/clang extensions.\n- The function signature (static void *OS_PthreadTaskEntry(void *arg)), pointer returns, and union usage are standard C/POSIX constructs and are not compiler extensions. The use of a union to reinterpret a void* as an integer-like osal_id_t may be implementation-defined behavior under the C standard, but it is not a compiler language extension and thus is outside the scope of MISRA Rule 1.2 as defined in your prompt.\n- The comment \"/* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\" is a static-analysis tool suppression comment, not a compiler extension.\n- No use of nonstandard pragmas or preprocessor extensions appears in the snippet.\nBecause Rule 1.2 is limited to explicit compiler language extensions documented as such, there are no code fragments here that need to be flagged for that rule."
