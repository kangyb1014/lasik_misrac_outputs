  "explanation": "OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The target function stores the incoming void* into local_arg.opaque_arg and then passes local_arg.id to OS_TaskEntryPoint. You must inspect the type/definition of this wrapper (union/struct) to determine what .id represents (e.g. a char* string, integer id, or other) and whether a pointer-to-string could be forwarded and later compared with memcmp.\n\nOS_TaskEntryPoint: This is the direct callee and receives the value derived from the wrapper. Its implementation/prototype is required to see whether it (a) calls memcmp itself, (b) treats the passed parameter as a null-terminated string and compares it, or (c) forwards it to other functions that may misuse memcmp.\n\nOS_TaskPrepare and OS_TaskExit: These are direct callees of OS_TaskEntryPoint (per the call graph). To determine if memcmp is used incorrectly anywhere reachable from OS_PthreadTaskEntry you must inspect these functions' bodies for uses of memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings (or for further forwarding to other routines that do so).\n\nmemcmp: The standard function being restricted by the MISRA rule. You need its uses (calls) and the call sites' argument types/contexts to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings (e.g. comparing char* buffers without length/explicit non\u2011string intent)."
