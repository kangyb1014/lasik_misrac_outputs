  "explanation": "- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The target writes to local_arg.opaque_arg and then reads local_arg.id. You must see the union/struct definition (member types, sizes, alignment, and any padding) to determine whether accessing a different union member is well-defined here and whether it can produce an invalid pointer/size that downstream string functions could dereference out-of-bounds.\n- OS_TaskEntryPoint (definition and prototype): This is called directly with local_arg.id and is the entry point that \"never returns.\" You need its parameter type, body, and any calls it makes to string.h functions (or to helpers that do) to determine whether the passed value can reach a string operation that might access out-of-bounds memory.\n- OS_TaskPrepare (definition): Called by OS_TaskEntryPoint per the call graph. Inspect its implementation for any use of memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/strncpy/strlen/etc., and for what buffers/lengths/limits it operates on.\n- OS_TaskExit (definition): Also called by OS_TaskEntryPoint. Inspect for string.h usage and the origin of buffers/length arguments.\n- Any data types and global buffers referenced by the above functions (e.g., the exact type of local_arg.id, task record or name buffers, and any size constants): To decide if a string function can access beyond an object you must see the definitions of the buffers/objects passed to those functions and any size/length constants or computed lengths used.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the union/type and the full bodies/signatures of OS_TaskEntryPoint, OS_TaskPrepare, OS_TaskExit, plus the concrete buffer/type definitions they use) is sufficient to trace whether a pointer or size derived from OS_PthreadTaskEntry can reach a string.h call and cause out-of-bounds access."
