  "explanation": "The claim is not proven from the snippet alone. Whether the trailing 'return NULL;' is unreachable depends entirely on the semantics of OS_TaskEntryPoint. If OS_TaskEntryPoint is in fact guaranteed never to return (e.g. defined in the same project with a non\u2011returning implementation or declared with a noreturn attribute), then the return statement cannot be reached and that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. However, the supplied code does not show such a guarantee \u2014 the comment \"Never returns\" is only an annotation, and the test evidence is inconclusive (empty log can be caused by lack of coverage or test harness issues). Therefore agent A\u2019s report asserting a definite MISRA 2.1 violation is not justified on the basis of the provided snippet alone.\n\nRecommendation: inspect the definition/declaration of OS_TaskEntryPoint in the project. If it is truly non\u2011returning, remove the unreachable return (and any other unreachable statements) or otherwise restructure so no unreachable code remains. If it may return, keep the return. To make the intent explicit for static analysers, either (a) add a standard noreturn annotation to OS_TaskEntryPoint and remove the following statements (accepting that will create unreachable code which must be removed to comply), or (b) retain the return if OS_TaskEntryPoint can return. Also add a unit test or instrumentation that exercises this path or examine the implementation to resolve the uncertainty."
