  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed:\n- OS_SockAddr_t: needed to know the full definition and size of the Addr object and the location/size of the AddrData member that is being reinterpreted. This determines whether the cast to the accessor is safe and whether any pointer derived from Addr can point out-of-bounds.\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: required to see the exact layout (offsets and member types) used by the function when it casts &Addr->AddrData to this accessor; necessary to know whether addrbuffer points to a valid object and its size.\n- Addr->AddrData (layout/size): the concrete size/array bounds of AddrData inside OS_SockAddr_t are required to verify that accessing &Addr->AddrData as an accessor does not create out-of-bounds access.\n- struct sockaddr (sa_family): the sa_family field value is used in the switch; need its definition/type (sa_family_t) to understand valid values and alignment/offset inside the accessor.\n- struct sockaddr_in (sin_addr): the IPv4 target object type whose address field addrbuffer is pointed at when AF_INET; need its size/representation to ensure inet_pton writes within bounds.\n- struct sockaddr_in6 (sin6_addr): the IPv6 target object type whose address field addrbuffer is used when AF_INET6; need its size/representation to ensure inet_pton writes within bounds.\n- struct in_addr (size): explicit size (typically 4 bytes) is required to confirm that the buffer passed to inet_pton for AF_INET is large enough.\n- struct in6_addr (size): explicit size (typically 16 bytes) is required to confirm that the buffer passed to inet_pton for AF_INET6 is large enough.\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: the numeric constants tested in the switch; needed to correlate the chosen branch with the expected buffer type/size.\n- inet_pton (prototype and semantics): although not a <string.h> function, inet_pton writes binary bytes into addrbuffer; we must know its contract (what it writes for AF_INET/AF_INET6, how many bytes, return values) to determine whether the write can overflow the pointed-to object.\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: these constants are not needed for string.h rule per se, but are included to make control-flow/return-value reasoning complete when analyzing the function's behavior.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule quoted explicitly concerns direct use of <string.h> functions. The target function does not call any standard string.h routines (memcpy/strcpy/etc.). However, to determine whether the code still causes out-of-bounds memory accesses (for example via inet_pton writing past the provided buffer), the above symbols (types, sizes, and inet_pton semantics) are required."
