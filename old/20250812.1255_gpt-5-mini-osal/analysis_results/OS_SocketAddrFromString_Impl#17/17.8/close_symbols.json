  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- OS_SockAddr_t: to confirm the exact declaration of the Addr parameter (that it is a pointer to a mutable object, and to inspect the AddrData member being referenced). This shows whether the function is modifying the object pointed-to (allowed) versus the parameter variable itself (disallowed).\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t: the code casts &Addr->AddrData to this accessor type; its definition (sa, sa_in, sa_in6 members) is required to determine whether any writes through Accessor would change the parameter variable vs. the object pointed-to.\n\n- struct sockaddr (sa_family): to identify the sa_family field type and ensure reading it is not a modification of the parameter itself.\n\n- struct sockaddr_in and struct in_addr: to verify that &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr yields an address inside the object referred to by Addr (i.e., modifies the pointed-to object, not the pointer variable).\n\n- struct sockaddr_in6 and struct in6_addr: same reason as above for the IPv6 branch (ensure writes target the object pointed-to).\n\n- sa_family_t (or whatever type sa.sa_family uses): to confirm the family is just a value read, not an l-value that could imply modification.\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6: to know which switch branches are compiled and that only these cases are tested (relevant for reasoning about which object addrbuffer can point into).\n\n- OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6 macro: to know whether the AF_INET6 branch is present in the build being analyzed (affects which object members may be targeted).\n\n- inet_pton prototype: crucial to know the parameter types and semantics \u2014 specifically that the third parameter is a void * to a destination buffer that inet_pton writes into (i.e., modifies the object pointed-to), and that the second parameter is const char * (so the function will not modify the string parameter). This distinguishes modification of the pointed-to object from modification of the pointer parameter itself.\n\n- OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS, OS_ERROR, OS_SUCCESS: the return macros/constants are not directly about parameter modification, but include them so the analyzer has the complete context of control flow and can verify no hidden side-effects are invoked by returning (and in case any of those are macros calling functions/macros that might modify parameters unexpectedly).\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine (a) whether any assignment to the parameter variables Addr or string occurs in the function, and (b) whether any side-effecting calls (inet_pton) only modify the object referred to by Addr (permitted) and do not attempt to modify the pointer parameters themselves (prohibited)."
