  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: inet_pton\u2019s prototype expects (int, const char *, void *). The string parameter is already const char * and addrbuffer is void * since the function writes the converted address into it. Making addrbuffer const would be incorrect because the destination is modified. A violation would occur if a pointer to data that is not modified (e.g. the input string) were declared without const, or if addrbuffer were declared as const void * (requiring a cast to call inet_pton), which would contravene Rule 8.13."
