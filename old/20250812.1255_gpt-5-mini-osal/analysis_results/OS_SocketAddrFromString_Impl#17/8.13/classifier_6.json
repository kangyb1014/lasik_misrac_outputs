  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The pointer addrbuffer is used as the destination argument to inet_pton(int, const char *, void *), which writes into the pointed object, so it must not be const-qualified. A violation of Rule 8.13 would occur if a non-const pointer were used to point to a const-qualified object (for example: const struct in6_addr const_addr; addrbuffer = &const_addr;), or if addrbuffer were accidentally declared non-const while the pointed data is never modified and could/should be const."
