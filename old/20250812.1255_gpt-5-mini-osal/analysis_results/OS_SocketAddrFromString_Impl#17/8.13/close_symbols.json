  "explanation": "- OS_SockAddr_t (full definition): needed to see the type and const-qualification of the Addr->AddrData member and whether Addr (the function parameter) could/should be a pointer-to-const. If Addr->AddrData or its subobjects are declared const, taking a non-const address or writing into them would violate the MISRA guidance.\n\n- OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t (full definition): this accessor type is used for the cast and exposes the sa, sa_in and sa_in6 members (and their member names like sa_family, sin_addr, sin6_addr). You must know the member types and any const qualifiers to determine whether addrbuffer (void *) is pointing to non-const memory appropriately or whether a const-qualified pointer would be required.\n\n- struct in_addr (definition): sin_addr is typically of this type. Knowing its exact declaration (and const qualification, e.g., if it is an array or typedef) is necessary to determine whether taking its address yields a pointer that should be const-qualified.\n\n- struct in6_addr (definition): same reason as in_addr for sin6_addr (when IPv6 is supported) \u2014 needed to determine whether the dest buffer is modifiable or should be const.\n\n- inet_pton prototype/declaration: inet_pton's parameter types (particularly the destination argument) determine whether the destination buffer is intended to be modified (usually void *). If inet_pton expects a non-const void * dest, then addrbuffer must be non-const; if it took const void * (it does not), using non-const would be questionable. The prototype is required to justify that the function writes into the buffer (so non-const is appropriate).\n\n- AF_INET and AF_INET6 macros/definitions: small but useful to confirm the sa_family values used in the switch; not directly about constness, but required to fully understand which member (sin_addr vs sin6_addr) is selected and therefore which type must be considered for const-qualification.\n\n(Other symbols such as the OS_* error-code macros are irrelevant to the pointer constness check and can be omitted.)"
