  "explanation": "The build error was caused by attempting to print iter->token with %llu while token can be an aggregate (non-integer) type on some builds. I changed the log to print the address of iter->token using %p and (const void *)&iter->token. This avoids treating an aggregate as an integer while preserving the logging intent and keeping the original logic of OS_FileOpenCheck unchanged."
