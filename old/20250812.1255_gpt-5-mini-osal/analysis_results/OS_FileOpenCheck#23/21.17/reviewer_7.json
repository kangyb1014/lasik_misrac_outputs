  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. strcmp requires both operands to be NUL-terminated strings; the code only checks that Filename is non-NULL (via OS_CHECK_POINTER) and does not verify NUL-termination of Filename or of stream->stream_name. If either buffer can legally contain no terminating '\\0' (for example the name was previously written filling the whole fixed-size name buffer without placing a terminator), then the call strcmp(stream->stream_name, Filename) may read past the object bounds, which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The provided probe and empty log do not disprove this possibility \u2014 they are inconclusive about runtime coverage and do not establish the invariant that both strings are always terminated. \n\nRecommendation: either ensure (by construction / documented invariant) that both buffers are NUL-terminated before calling strcmp, or replace the call with a bounded check that cannot read past the known buffer sizes. For example, check termination with strnlen(stream->stream_name, MAX) and strnlen(Filename, MAX) (or other appropriate max lengths) before calling strcmp, or use a combination of strncmp/memcmp together with explicit length/termination checks so no out-of-bounds access can occur."
