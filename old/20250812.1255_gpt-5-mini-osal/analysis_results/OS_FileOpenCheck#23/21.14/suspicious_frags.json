  "explanation": "No uses of memcmp are present in the provided code. The only string comparison is strcmp(stream->stream_name, Filename) == 0, which does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (the rule forbids memcmp for null-terminated strings). The Filename pointer is checked by OS_CHECK_POINTER, and stream_name is a char array; no macro or shown definition uses memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
