This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t: The memset call uses sizeof(arg). The full typedef/struct/union definition is needed to determine arg's actual size and layout so you can prove memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg)) does not write past the bounds of the object or its subobjects.\n- osal_id_t: arg.id is assigned from the parameter global_task_id (type osal_id_t). The exact typedef/size is required to understand how the id member maps into the wrapper object (important if the wrapper is a union or has padding) and to ensure no out-of-bounds write/aliasing occurs when id is written.\n- (OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t).opaque_arg (member type): The code passes arg.opaque_arg to pthread_setspecific. Knowing the type and position of opaque_arg (pointer vs array vs integer) and whether it aliases other members is necessary to understand any interplay between memset and subsequent uses of that member (and to ensure memset covered the intended bytes without overflow).\n- memset (declaration from <string.h>): To apply the MISRA rule you must confirm this is the standard memset prototype (void *memset(void *, int, size_t)) and verify the size parameter semantics. This ensures the call-site usage (address, value, size) is interpreted correctly against object bounds.\n- pthread_setspecific (declaration): While not a string function itself, its prototype reveals what arg.opaque_arg value is being stored (void *). This helps determine whether opaque_arg is intended to point into arg (stack) or be a value type, which influences whether the memset usage could be misapplied to produce out-of-bounds accesses later.\n- POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey (type): The key used for pthread_setspecific determines the expected value type stored for the key (usually void*). Knowing the key's intended use helps evaluate whether opaque_arg's value is supposed to reference an object with sufficient lifetime \u2014 relevant to safety analysis of how memset-initialized data will be used.\n\nNote: The MISRA rule in question concerns bounds of objects accessed by string.h functions (here memset). The primary required symbol is the concrete definition of OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t (and its members, including opaque_arg and id) plus the standard memset declaration. The other symbols support understanding how the memset-initialized object is subsequently used."
