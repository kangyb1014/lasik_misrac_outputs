  "explanation": "The function has a single parameter, global_task_id (type osal_id_t), which is only read and copied into a local union member (arg.id = global_task_id). There is no assignment to or modification of the parameter itself. No pointer parameters exist in the function signature, so there is no risk of modifying a pointer parameter (only local addresses &old_state and &old_type are passed to pthread_setcancelstate/type, which are addresses of local variables, not function parameters). POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey and arg.opaque_arg used in pthread_setspecific are not function parameters. Therefore no code fragments modify the function parameter and nothing else needs investigation for Rule 17.8."
