  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. In particular:\n- There are no vendor/implementation-specific tokens such as __attribute__, __asm__, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, or compiler-specific pragmas.\n- The union OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t and its usage are plain C; using one union member to set another (type punning) is a language-level behavior (not a compiler-extension token) and would be a semantic/undefined-behavior concern, not an explicit compiler-extension covered by MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2.\n- pthread_* functions and POSIX thread-specific APIs are platform/library APIs (POSIX), not compiler language extensions; per the rule wording you requested, these should only be reported if the compiler documentation explicitly states they are provided as a language extension \u2014 the code itself does not contain compiler-extension syntax.\n- The comment directive \"/* cppcheck-suppress ... */\" is a static-analysis tool annotation, not a compiler language extension.\n- The variadic macro OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) and use of // single-line comments are standard in C99 and later, not compiler-specific extensions in compliant compilers.\nTherefore there are no fragments in this function that match the criterion of using compiler language extensions explicitly documented as such. If you want me to also flag platform-specific or POSIX API usage (e.g., pthreads) as potential deviations from strictly standard C, say so and I will list those."
