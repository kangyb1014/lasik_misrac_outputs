  "explanation": "Not enough evidence to confirm the violation. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns the declaration of pointers \u2014 they should be qualified with const when the pointed-to object is never modified. The OS_TaskRegister_Impl function only shows a read-only use of arg.opaque_arg (it is passed to pthread_setspecific which takes a const void*), but the rule applies to the pointer\u2019s declaration and all its uses across the program, not just this call site. The code excerpt does not show the definition of OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t nor how opaque_arg is used elsewhere. In many real implementations that wrapper is used as an integer/pointer union (arg.id = global_task_id; then arg.opaque_arg is passed/stored), or the pointer may be retrieved later via pthread_getspecific (which returns void*), so making the member const void * might be incompatible with other legitimate uses. Therefore the report is not proven: the claim may be plausible locally but cannot be confirmed from the provided code and so is not a correct MISRA violation report as given."
