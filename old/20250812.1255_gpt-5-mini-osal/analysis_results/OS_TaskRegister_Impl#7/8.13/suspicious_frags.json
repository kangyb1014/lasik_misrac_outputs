  "explanation": "The two fragments above are the only places where a pointer could reasonably be const-qualified under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The union member 'opaque_arg' is declared as 'void *' but is used as an opaque value passed to pthread_setspecific (whose parameter is 'const void *'), so the const-qualification of that pointer field and its use should be reviewed. Other pointer uses in the function do not require investigation for this rule: - pthread_setcancelstate()/pthread_setcanceltype() take non-const int * because they write into those locations (so const would be incorrect). - memset() operates on a modifiable object (requires non-const). - The assignment 'arg.id = global_task_id;' stores an integer into the union (not a pointer-qualified issue). - OS_ArgCallback_t (a function pointer) and strerror() return types are governed by their APIs; they either cannot be const-qualified or are outside the scope of changing local pointer object qualifications. Therefore no other fragments need to be investigated for Rule 8.13."
