  "explanation": "To decide whether OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions/declarations of the identifiers it references and the types they use. For each symbol: \n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n  - Need the struct/variable definition (and the types of its members such as AccessMutex and AccessCancelState) to check for use of language extensions in its declaration (e.g. GCC __attribute__, packed/aligned pragmas, anonymous structs/unions, bit\u2011fields using nonstandard widths, statement expressions inside initializers, typeof, __extension__ markers, etc.).\n\n- BSP_DEBUG\n  - Need the macro or function definition to determine whether it uses compiler extensions (e.g. GCC statement expressions ({...}), nonstandard variadic macro tricks, __attribute__((format)), inline asm, or other vendor extensions). A macro can hide many extensions, so its body must be examined.\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock\n  - Need the prototype/definition to ensure it is a standard declaration and does not use vendor extensions in its declaration (attributes, inline assembly, nonstandard linkage, or compiler-specific macros). Also needed to check any macros wrapping it.\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate\n  - Same rationale as pthread_mutex_unlock: inspect its declaration/definition for compiler extensions or nonstandard constructs.\n\n- strerror\n  - Need the declaration (normally from <string.h>) to verify it doesn't rely on implementation extensions (attributes, nonstandard calling conventions, macros hiding extensions).\n\n- pthread_mutex_t\n  - The concrete type underlying AccessMutex may be a typedef or struct/union that could use compiler extensions (anonymous unions, attributes, special alignment, or implementation-specific internals). Inspecting it is necessary to detect extension usage.\n\n- NULL\n  - The macro/definition of NULL in the translation unit may be implementation specific (e.g. ((void*)0) vs 0L) or use extensions; check its definition if it appears in any examined declarations (pthread_setcancelstate second parameter is passed NULL here).\n\nYou do not need unrelated callers listed in the static call graph. The items above are minimal to determine whether any language extensions are introduced/used by the symbols referenced in OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl."
