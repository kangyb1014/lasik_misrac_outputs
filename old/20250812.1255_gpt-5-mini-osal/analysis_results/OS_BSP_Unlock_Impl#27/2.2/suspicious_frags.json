  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments were not included because they perform observable side-effects or control the program behaviour and thus are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2. Examples include the actual pthread calls (pthread_mutex_lock / pthread_mutex_unlock) which change mutex state, the pthread_setcancelstate calls that change thread cancelability, the console output loop and calls to OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl (which perform I/O), and the update of console->ReadPos \u2014 removal of any of these operations would alter program behaviour. Unreachable code is explicitly excluded from the Rule 2.2 dead-code definition, so checks that determine control flow must be inspected for correctness but are not automatically dead code; the fragments listed above were selected because they are the most likely places to indicate compiled-out logging or redundant/no-op constructs that merit investigation."
