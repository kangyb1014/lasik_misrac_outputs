  "explanation": "For MISRA dead-code analysis of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- pthread_mutex_unlock\n  - The branch under analysis is 'if (status < 0)'. Determining whether that condition can ever be true requires the actual return-value semantics/implementation of pthread_mutex_unlock on the target platform (0 on success, positive error codes, or any possibility of negative returns). If pthread_mutex_unlock never returns negative values, the BSP_DEBUG branch is unreachable during execution and constitutes dead code (executed but removable without effect).\n\n- pthread_setcancelstate\n  - The else-path restores the previous thread cancelability state. You must know its semantics and side-effects (and whether removing the conditional branch could change behaviour) to decide if removing the BSP_DEBUG branch alters program behaviour.\n\n- strerror\n  - Used to format the error message in the BSP_DEBUG branch. If the branch can execute, strerror has an effect (string lookup) and may rely on errno-like semantics; if the branch is dead, calls to strerror would be removable. Its presence helps determine whether the branch has observable side-effects beyond logging.\n\n- BSP_DEBUG\n  - The logging macro/function may have side-effects (I/O, global state, or test instrumentation). You must inspect its definition to decide whether removing the BSP_DEBUG call would change observable behaviour (which would mean the code is not dead even if the condition is unlikely).\n\n- OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n  - The global structure provides AccessMutex and AccessCancelState. You need its definition to know the types passed to pthread functions and whether AccessCancelState is used elsewhere; this affects whether restoring the cancel state is necessary and whether removing parts of the function would change program behaviour.\n\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl\n  - Lock/Unlock are a pair. To assess whether removing or changing the unlock (or its branches) affects program behaviour you must see the lock implementation: how AccessCancelState is set, whether any invariants are established that the unlock relies on, and whether the lock always precedes this unlock on all call paths.\n\n- OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl\n  - One of the callers. Reachability analysis (is OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl ever executed in production code?) requires inspecting callers. If no reachable callers exist, the whole function could be dead. Conversely, if callers always call Lock before Unlock and platform guarantees hold, that informs whether the error branch can be triggered.\n\n- UT_BSP_Unlock\n  - A test caller. Tests can create execution that production does not. You must know whether test-only callers exercise the BSP_DEBUG branch (affecting whether it is live code) and whether test-only usage counts toward MISRA dead-code determination for the project.\n\nIn short: pthread_mutex_unlock's return semantics and BSP_DEBUG's side-effects are the critical items to decide if the 'if (status < 0)' branch is dead; the global state, lock implementation, and callers are required to judge reachability and whether removing the branch or the whole function would alter observable program behaviour."
