  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_unlock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /* Restore previous cancellability state */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState, NULL);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl:\n#define BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobalData_t OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n...\nvoid OS_BSP_Lock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_lock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_lock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * Temporarily Disable/Defer thread cancellation.\n         * Note that OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl() calls write() which is a cancellation point.\n         * So if this calling task is canceled, it risks leaving the BSP locked.\n         */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState);\n    }\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ConsoleOutput_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *token)\n{\n    size_t                        StartPos;\n    size_t                        EndPos;\n    size_t                        WriteSize;\n    OS_console_internal_record_t *console;\n\n    console  = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_console_table, *token);\n    StartPos = console->ReadPos;\n    EndPos   = console->WritePos;\n\n    OS_BSP_Lock_Impl();\n\n    while (StartPos != EndPos)\n    {\n        if (StartPos > EndPos)\n        {\n            /* handle wrap */\n            WriteSize = console->BufSize - StartPos;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            WriteSize = EndPos - StartPos;\n        }\n\n        OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl(&console->BufBase[StartPos], WriteSize);\n\n        StartPos += WriteSize;\n        if (StartPos >= console->BufSize)\n        {\n            /* handle wrap */\n            StartPos = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl();\n\n    /* Update the global with the new read location */\n    console->ReadPos = StartPos;\n}\n...\nvoid UT_BSP_Unlock(void)\n{\n    OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl();\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nBSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The BSP_DEBUG macro is defined as empty (#define BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__)). The invocation BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_unlock: %s\\n\", strerror(status)); is removed by the preprocessor (the strerror() call is not evaluated) and therefore does not produce any executed operation in the build where BSP_DEBUG is empty. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Because this fragment is not executed (and in builds where BSP_DEBUG expands to logging it is executed and not removable without changing behaviour), it does not meet the rule's definition of dead code."
