  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not introduce pointer objects or pointer expressions that could be const-qualified and thus do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The local variable 'status' is an int (not a pointer). The function prologue/brace, the else block and the call to pthread_setcancelstate use a scalar (AccessCancelState) and a NULL literal for the second parameter; those do not declare or pass a pointer to a non-const object that could reasonably be made const (the second parameter is NULL, and when an API requires a non-const pointer because it may be modified, const qualification is not applicable). The BSP_DEBUG macro is defined empty in the provided additional code, so there are no other pointer-typed expressions in the macro invocation beyond strerror(status) (which is included above). Therefore only the listed fragments need further investigation for possible const-qualification issues."
