  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for statements are present in the provided target function or the additional code fragments. MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 addresses the well-formedness of for loops (the three clauses and the single loop counter requirement). Since there are no 'for' statements in OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint, OS_strnlen, the structure definitions, or the table/macro usages shown, there are no code fragments requiring investigation for Rule 14.2. Note: macros or other code not provided (e.g. the expansion of OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET or other external functions) could contain for loops; those would need to be inspected if their source is available. Based on the supplied code only, nothing to investigate for Rule 14.2."
