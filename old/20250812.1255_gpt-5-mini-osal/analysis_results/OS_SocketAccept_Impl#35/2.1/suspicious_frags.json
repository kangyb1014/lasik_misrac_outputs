  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments for investigation because they are normal, potentially reachable runtime paths and/or error handling that cannot be proven unreachable from the provided code: the accept() call and its subsequent fd < 0 error handling are standard runtime outcomes (accept can succeed or fail); updating Addr->ActualLength and calling OS_IMPL_SET_SOCKET_FLAGS(conn_token) are correct follow-up actions when accept succeeds; the initial OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET() calls and variable declarations are obviously reachable; and the use of OS_SelectSingle_Impl() when selectable is true is a valid control flow that can legitimately return different results. The only fragments that raise a concern for unreachable-code analysis are the ones listed: the explicit else branch that unconditionally sets return_code = OS_SUCCESS (which may be dead if sockets are always made selectable), the pre-initialization of operation together with the select/else logic, the timeout branch that may never be taken depending on selectable/Select implementation, and the assignment impl->selectable = true in OS_SetSocketDefaultFlags_Impl (which can make the non-selectable branch impossible). These should be investigated together (socket initialization paths and OS_SelectSingle_Impl behavior) to determine whether any branch is truly unreachable."
