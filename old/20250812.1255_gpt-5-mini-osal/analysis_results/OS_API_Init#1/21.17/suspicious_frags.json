  "explanation": "All other code fragments do not call any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn). The remaining lines are control flow (if, for, switch), assignments, arithmetic, or calls to OS_* initialization functions and OS_DEBUG. OS_DEBUG is a logging macro (likely wrapping stdio) and is not one of the <string.h> string handling functions covered by this rule; therefore it need not be investigated under Rule 21.17. No other occurrences of memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn appear in the provided code fragment."
