  "explanation": "No calls to any of the <string.h> functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the provided function. The function only uses OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime, sem_timedwait, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET, errno and ETIMEDOUT; none of these are string-handling functions. There is no direct manipulation of character buffers or pointer arithmetic on strings in the shown code. The separate symbol \"size_t size\" is unrelated and not used here. If any of the called macros/functions (e.g. OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime or OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) internally use string.h routines, those implementations are not present in the provided code and would need to be inspected separately \u2014 but within the supplied code fragment itself there are no uses of the specified string functions to trigger Rule 21.17."
