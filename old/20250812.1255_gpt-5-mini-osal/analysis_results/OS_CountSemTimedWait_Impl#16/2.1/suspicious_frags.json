  "explanation": "I did not find any code fragments that are provably unreachable and therefore that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Rationale:\n\n- The conditional chain in OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl is reachable in all its parts depending on sem_timedwait() outcome: the success branch (return 0), the ETIMEDOUT branch (sem_timedwait() fails and errno==ETIMEDOUT), and the final else (sem_timedwait() fails with errno other than ETIMEDOUT). None of these branches is syntactically or semantically impossible.\n\n- The call to OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime(msecs, &ts) is executed unconditionally and its internal code is reachable: clock_gettime() executes, the arithmetic that adds seconds and nanoseconds can lead to the tm->tv_nsec >= 1e9 condition (when the residue pushes it over the boundary), so the normalization branch is reachable.\n\n- The macro expansion for impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_count_sem_table, *token) expands to &OS_impl_count_sem_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(&(*token))], which is equivalent to &OS_impl_count_sem_table[OS_ObjectIndexFromToken(token)] \u2014 this is valid and does not introduce unreachable code. (Index-out-of-range would be undefined behavior but is not the same as unreachable code.)\n\n- There are no early returns, conditional compilation blocks, or constant expressions that would make any code path permanently unreachable.\n\nBecause none of the code constructs are syntactically impossible or statically unreachable, there are no fragments to report for further investigation under Rule 2.1."
