  ],
  "explanation": "Other code fragments (the final \"return IdBuf;\" in OS_NetworkGetID, the assignment '*IdBuf = gethostid();' within the implementation, and the OS_SUCCESS macro) are not flagged because they are actively used to produce observable behaviour: the implementation writes the network ID into IdBuf and the caller returns that value, so removing those operations would change program behaviour. The macro definition is a normal constant definition and not dead. The selected fragments are suspicious because the low-level implementation unconditionally returns OS_SUCCESS (and the code contains multiple identical definitions of the implementation), which makes the caller's failure branch never taken with the current implementation and therefore worth investigating for possible dead-code or redundant checks and for duplicated/overlapping definitions that may indicate copy-paste or build issues. No other executable statements in the provided snippets meet the criterion of being operations that appear to be executed while removable without affecting behaviour."
