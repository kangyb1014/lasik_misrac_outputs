  "scenario": "The failure branch (return -1) is never taken because OS_NetworkGetID_Impl always returns OS_SUCCESS (gethostid() has no failure modes). That makes the branch unreachable, not \"dead code\" as defined by MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code = executed but removable). Therefore Rule 2.2 is not violated. Note: if the implementation of OS_NetworkGetID_Impl could ever return an error on some platform, the branch would become relevant."
