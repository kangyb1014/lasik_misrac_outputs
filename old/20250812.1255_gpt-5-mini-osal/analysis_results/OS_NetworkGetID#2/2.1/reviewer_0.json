Therefore the condition (OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS) can never be true and the consequent statement \"return -1;\" is unreachable.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_NetworkGetID_Probe(const char *tag, int32 IdBuf, int32 ret)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/17.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        /* Print the tag, IdBuf and return code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.1 forbids unreachable code anywhere in the project. Whether the 'return -1;' branch is actually unreachable depends on the behaviour of OS_NetworkGetID_Impl. The target function alone does not prove unreachability \u2014 the branch is only unreachable if, for the entire project, OS_NetworkGetID_Impl can be proven to always return OS_SUCCESS. Agent A\u2019s scenario states a particular implementation (\"*IdBuf = gethostid(); return OS_SUCCESS;\") that would make the condition impossible and thus the 'return -1;' unreachable. If that implementation is actually present in the same project (and cannot return any other value), then the agent\u2019s report is correct: the code contains unreachable code and violates Rule 2.1. However, based solely on the supplied OS_NetworkGetID source, you cannot conclude a violation without whole\u2011project knowledge of OS_NetworkGetID_Impl. The provided test instrumentation was inconclusive (no log entries), so it does not confirm the scenario. Recommendation: perform whole\u2011project analysis or inspect the implementation of OS_NetworkGetID_Impl; if it truly always returns OS_SUCCESS, remove or refactor the dead branch or document/justify it per the project\u2019s compliance process."
