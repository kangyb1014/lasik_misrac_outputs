  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer targets and const qualification. In this function the only pointer usage is taking the address of the local variable IdBuf and passing it to OS_NetworkGetID_Impl. There are no other pointer declarations, pointer parameters, or pointer operations in the remaining lines (function return type is an int32, returns are integer values, and comments are non-code), so no other fragments need investigation for this rule."
