  "explanation": "No code fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The only pointer parameter present is in OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf), and the implementation writes to the object pointed to (*IdBuf = gethostid()) rather than modifying the pointer parameter itself. The caller OS_NetworkGetID passes the address of a local variable (&IdBuf), which is allowed. OS_NetworkGetID has no parameters to modify. Therefore there is no evidence of reassigning or otherwise modifying pointer parameters (the pointer variables) that would violate Rule 17.8."
