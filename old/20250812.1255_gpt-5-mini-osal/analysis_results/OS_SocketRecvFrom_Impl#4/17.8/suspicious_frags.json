  "explanation": "No function parameters are assigned to or otherwise modified in this function body. Specific points checked:\n- token is only dereferenced (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token)) or passed to OS_SelectSingle_Impl; there is no assignment to the token parameter itself.\n- buffer is passed to recvfrom so the object pointed-to may be modified (allowed by the rule), but the buffer pointer parameter is not reassigned.\n- buflen and timeout are only read (used in calls/conditions); neither is assigned.\n- RemoteAddr pointer is used to obtain the address of its AddrData member and, after recvfrom, its pointee's ActualLength field is assigned. Assigning to the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by Rule 17.8; the RemoteAddr pointer itself is not modified.\n- All local variables that are assigned (sa, addrlen, waitflags, operation, return_code, impl, os_result) are local to the function, not parameters.\nTherefore there are no code fragments in this function that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
