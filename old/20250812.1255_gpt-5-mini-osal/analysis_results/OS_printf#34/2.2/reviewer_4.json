When OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER the code executes a read/compare and then an empty macro expansion (no observable effect). Removing the entire branch (including the read/compare) would not change program behaviour in this project configuration, so the branch constitutes dead code.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void OS_printf_probe(const char *event, const char *fmt_string, int global_state, int printf_enabled, int actualsz)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/274.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f != NULL)\n    {\n        time_t now = time(NULL);\n        fprintf(f, \"%ld: %s: GlobalState=%d, PrintfEnabled=%d, actualsz=%d, fmt='%s'\\n\",\n                (long)now,\n                (event != NULL) ? event : \"(null)\",\n                global_state,\n                printf_enabled,\n                actualsz,\n                (fmt_string != NULL) ? fmt_string : \"(null)\");\n        fclose(f);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid OS_printf(const char *String, ...)\n{\n    va_list va;\n    char    msg_buffer[OS_BUFFER_SIZE];\n    int     actualsz;\n\n    BUGCHECK_VOID(String != NULL)\n\n    /* Record entry state (actualsz unknown yet -> use -1) */\n    OS_printf_probe(\"entry\", String, OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState, (int)OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled, -1);\n\n    if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER)\n    {\n        /* Log that we took the uninitialized branch and the observed state. */\n        OS_printf_probe(\"uninitialized_branch\", String, OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState, (int)OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled, -1);\n\n        /*\n         * Catch some historical mis-use of the OS_printf() call.\n         *\n         * Typically OS_printf() should NOT be called before OS_API_Init().\n         *\n         * This was never guaranteed to work, particularly on a VxWorks\n         * deployment where the utility task was enabled.\n         *\n         * However, some PSPs do this, particularly those that used POSIX\n         * where it happened to work (because OS_printf just called printf).\n         *\n         * As a workaround, use the OS_DEBUG facility to dump the message,\n         * along with a clue that this API is being used inappropriately.\n         *\n         * If debugging is not enabled, then this message will be silently\n         * discarded.\n         */\n        OS_DEBUG(\"BUG: OS_printf() called when OSAL not initialized: %s\", String);\n\n        /* Record that the branch executed (after OS_DEBUG) */\n        OS_printf_probe(\"uninitialized_branch_after_debug\", String, OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState, (int)OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled, -1);\n    }\n    else if (OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled)\n    {\n        /* Log that we will attempt to format and print */\n        OS_printf_probe(\"format_and_write_enter\", String, OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState, (int)OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled, -1);\n\n        /* Format and determine the size of string to write */\n        va_start(va, String);\n        actualsz = vsnprintf(msg_buffer, sizeof(msg_buffer), String, va);\n        va_end(va);\n\n        if (actualsz < 0)\n        {\n            /* unlikely: vsnprintf failed */\n            actualsz = 0;\n        }\n        else if (actualsz >= OS_BUFFER_SIZE)\n        {\n            /* truncate */\n            actualsz = OS_BUFFER_SIZE -

  "explanation": "The agent A report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. In the provided configuration OS_DEBUG is an empty macro, so the only actions taken when the if-condition (OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState != OS_INIT_MAGIC_NUMBER) is true are the read/compare and the empty macro expansion. The exhaustive test traces show this branch is executed multiple times yet produces no observable effect (and the test harness asserts there are no missing scenarios), so removing the branch (including the read/compare) would not change program behaviour. Therefore the executed branch qualifies as dead code and the reported Rule 2.2 violation is correct."
