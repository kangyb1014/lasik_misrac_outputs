This satisfies MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (Note: a violation would occur if the OS_DEBUG interface or its implementation required or stored a non-const char * \u2014 e.g. if OS_DEBUG were prototyped to accept/assign the pointer to a plain char * or modified the pointed data \u2014 because that would discard the const qualifier.)"
