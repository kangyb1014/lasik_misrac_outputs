  "explanation": "We must determine whether the parameter variable 'lfs' is ever modified inside lfs_fs_mkconsistent. Any macro or inlined code that expands into the body of this function could perform an assignment to the parameter variable (e.g. \"lfs = ...\"). Therefore include: \n\n- LFS_LOCK: May be a macro or inline routine. If it expands into code in the caller, it could modify the parameter variable 'lfs' (direct assignment or via other side effects). We need its definition to see whether it assigns to 'lfs' or only operates on the object pointed to by lfs->cfg.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK (could be macro/inline that mutates the parameter variable when expanded).\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macros sometimes evaluate arguments or expand into code; if this macro is defined to include side-effecting code (or reassignments) it could modify 'lfs' when expanded. We need its definition.\n\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: The target function calls this symbol. If it is a normal function, modifications of its own parameter do not violate the rule for the caller. But if it is a macro or an inline function that expands into caller code, it could reassign the caller's parameter variable. Include its definition to determine whether it is a separate function call or expansion that could modify 'lfs'.\n\n- lfs_t (type/definition): Know the exact parameter type and qualifiers (e.g., whether the parameter is declared with const) and the structure layout (so we can distinguish modifying the pointer variable 'lfs' vs modifying the object it points to, which is allowed). This helps determine whether any assignment encountered in macros/expansions would actually be assigning to the parameter variable or to the pointee.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to decide if any code that is textually inside lfs_fs_mkconsistent (via macro expansion or inlining) assigns to the parameter variable 'lfs', which would be a MISRA violation."
