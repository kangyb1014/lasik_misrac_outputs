  "explanation": "- lfs_file_open_: Direct callee of lfs_file_open. You must inspect its implementation to see whether it uses memcmp to compare the incoming path (const char *path) or other null-terminated strings \u2014 that would constitute a MISRA memcmp violation in the call chain.  \n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Direct callee (and used in an assertion) before opening. Although it is unlikely, it could perform string comparisons (e.g. comparing filenames) using memcmp; include it to ensure no memcmp-based string comparisons occur prior to or as part of the open sequence.  \n- lfs_file_opencfg_: Callee of lfs_file_open_. The implementation may perform name/path comparisons or checks and is a likely place for memcmp usage; include to inspect deeper in the call chain.  \n- memcmp: The standard library function the MISRA rule targets. You must locate any direct calls to memcmp (or thin wrappers that forward to it) in the above functions to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings (the exact violation)."
