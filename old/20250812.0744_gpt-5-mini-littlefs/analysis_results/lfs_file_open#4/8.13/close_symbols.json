  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA const-pointer rule you must know whether the pointers passed into and through lfs_file_open are modified or merely observed. Concretely:\n\n- lfs_file_open_ (prototype + implementation): lfs_file_open forwards both file and path to lfs_file_open_. You need its prototype to know the const-qualification of its parameters (e.g. does path appear as const char * or char *?) and its implementation to see whether it modifies *file or the contents of path. This determines whether the non-const/const qualification in the public wrapper is appropriate.\n\n- lfs_file_opencfg_ (prototype + implementation): lfs_file_open_ calls lfs_file_opencfg_. A deeper callee may perform modifications (to file state or to path buffer), so its prototype/implementation are required to determine whether any pointer must remain non-const because it is written to.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (prototype + implementation): The call to lfs_mlist_isopen uses an explicit cast (struct lfs_mlist*)file. You must see lfs_mlist_isopen's signature to know whether it expects a const mlist pointer or a non-const one, and inspect its implementation to verify whether it modifies the object. If it does not modify, its parameter should be const; if it modifies, passing a const pointer would be incorrect.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition): The cast from lfs_file_t * to struct lfs_mlist * implies layout/aliasing. You need the struct definition to confirm compatibility and to see which fields might be read or written by the callees, to decide if const qualification is possible.\n\n- typedef/definition of lfs_file_t: To determine whether lfs_file_t and struct lfs_mlist are interchangeable and whether functions operating on 'file' modify it (thus forbidding const), you must inspect the lfs_file_t definition.\n\nThese symbols together allow you to trace whether any pointer parameters are actually modified by callees (directly or indirectly). That is the factual basis for deciding if pointers should be const-qualified (or must remain non-const) under the MISRA rule."
