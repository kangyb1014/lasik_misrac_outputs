  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: Could be a macro or inline function that takes lfs->cfg as argument. We must see its expansion/definition to ensure it does not assign to or otherwise modify the parameter variable `lfs` (pointer itself) via side-effects in the macro.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its implementation could include side-effects that might write to the `lfs` parameter expression; check its definition.\n- LFS_TRACE: Usually a logging macro; if implemented as a macro it could evaluate or modify its arguments. We need its definition to ensure it does not assign to any parameter (file/path/flags) or change them via side-effects.\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro can evaluate expressions and possibly expand into code that touches its argument; include its definition to confirm it does not modify the parameter variables (notably the casted `(struct lfs_mlist*)file`).\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: The callee used inside LFS_ASSERT. We need its prototype/definition to confirm whether it is a function or macro and whether it could modify the passed expression. Also to check whether its signature would force any unexpected conversions/assignments that could alter the caller's parameter variables.\n- lfs_file_open_: Direct callee of lfs_file_open. We need its prototype/definition to confirm how the `file` parameter is passed (e.g., lfs_file_t * vs lfs_file_t **), and to ensure that it is not a macro that could expand and modify the caller's parameter variables.\n- struct lfs_t (definition): lfs->cfg and lfs->mlist are accessed. The struct definition is needed to verify whether accessing these fields could involve macros/overloaded operators or unusual types that might cause modification of the `lfs` parameter expression.\n- typedef/definition lfs_file_t: Needed to understand the cast to (struct lfs_mlist*)file and to verify whether passing `file` could invoke any conversions or macros that would modify the `file` parameter variable.\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition): Required because `file` is cast to this type for lfs_mlist_isopen. Its definition can show whether the cast or the callee could cause side-effects affecting the `file` parameter variable.\n\nInclude these symbols so the next analyzer can determine whether any of the called macros/functions or type operations perform assignments to the parameter variables (lfs, file, path, flags) \u2014 the precise behavior needed to verify compliance with the MISRA rule that function parameters themselves must not be modified."
