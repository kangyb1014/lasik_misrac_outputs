  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_open code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/32.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_open as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_open:\n```c\nint lfs_file_open(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file, const char *path, int flags) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_open(%p, %p, \\\"%s\\\", %x)\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, path, (unsigned)flags);\n    LFS_ASSERT(!lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    err = lfs_file_open_(lfs, file, path, flags);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_open -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_open:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_open code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",

  "scenario": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used. The function and its macros use standard C constructs (casts ((void)cfg), a variadic macro for LFS_TRACE which is standard since C99, and assert via LFS_ASSERT). There is no use of compiler-specific keywords or extensions (asm, __attribute__, __builtin_*, inline as an extension, or other vendor-specific extensions).",
