  "explanation": "Include the full definitions/implementations of the listed symbols because they are required to determine whether any string.h functions are used on the path/buffer/size arguments and whether those uses can access out of bounds:\n\n- lfs_getattr_: Direct callee of lfs_getattr; its implementation will show whether it calls any string.h functions (memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc.) on the user-supplied path or buffer and whether it bounds-checks sizes.\n- lfs_dir_find: Called by lfs_getattr_; directory lookup code commonly manipulates path strings or copies metadata into buffers \u2014 must inspect for string.h usage and bounds checks.\n- lfs_tag_id: Utility called by lfs_getattr_; could participate in parsing tags from on-disk data and may use mem* or str* operations on buffers.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Likely reads directory entries into memory/buffers; may use memcpy/memmove or string functions to populate output buffers \u2014 include its code to check bounds handling.\n- lfs_dir_get: Retrieves directory entry fields into caller-provided buffers; this is a primary candidate where copying into 'buffer' (from lfs_getattr) could occur \u2014 must verify safe length checks.\n- lfs_min: Utility function; include to be sure it doesn't wrap or truncate lengths in a way that masks an out-of-bounds copy length calculation.\n- lfs_tag_size: Utility giving sizes for tags; used to compute copy lengths \u2014 including it is necessary to verify computed lengths used with string.h calls are correct.\n- lfs_t: The filesystem context type; contains the user buffer/size flow indirectly (via calls) and may define fields used in copy/length calculations. Need its definition to understand pointer/size semantics.\n- struct lfs_config: The cfg member of lfs_t (used with LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and possibly passed to helper functions) may contain callbacks, buffer sizes, or alignment constraints that affect safe copying; include its definition.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: Macros or functions used in lfs_getattr; they may expand to code that uses string or memory functions or change control flow relevant to buffer handling (e.g., temporary buffers). Include their definitions to rule out any hidden string.h usage.\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro/function can invoke snprintf/strncpy/strlen/etc. when formatting messages that include user strings (path, buffer pointers). Include its definition because it commonly uses <string.h> or <stdio.h> facilities that could operate on the provided path or buffer.\n\nIn short: include lfs_getattr_ and the transitive callees that manipulate directory entries/buffers, plus the key types and macros (locking/trace/config) that affect or may themselves perform string/memory operations. These are the symbols necessary to evaluate any uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn and to check that all uses are bounds-checked per the MISRA rule."
