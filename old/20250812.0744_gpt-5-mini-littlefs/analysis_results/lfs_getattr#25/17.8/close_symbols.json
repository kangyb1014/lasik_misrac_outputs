  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or wrapper used in the function (err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)). Macros expand into code in the caller\u2019s scope and therefore can contain assignments to the function parameters (for example, could expand to statements that assign to lfs or other parameter names). You must inspect the definition to ensure it does not modify any parameter variable (e.g. lfs, path, type, buffer, size).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 it is invoked with lfs->cfg and may be a macro that expands into code in this function. Inspect its definition for any assignments to the parameter identifiers.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This variadic/debug macro is called with the parameter identifiers (lfs, path, type, buffer, size). Because it is a macro, its expansion could contain side-effecting statements (including assignments to those identifiers). Its definition must be checked to ensure it does not modify any parameter variable.\n\n- lfs_getattr_: The call could be to an ordinary function (which cannot change the caller\u2019s parameter variables) but it might also be a macro or static inline in the same translation unit. If it is a macro/inline it would expand into the caller\u2019s scope and could modify parameter variables. Include its definition to determine whether it modifies any parameters in this function.\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct): The parameter lfs is of type lfs_t*. You need the lfs_t definition to understand how lfs is used (e.g. lfs->cfg) and to check whether any macro expansions use lfs as an lvalue and attempt assignments (or take its address).\n\n- lfs->cfg type (the cfg member\u2019s type/struct): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg; their implementations might rely on the cfg type and might perform operations that expand into code using the cfg expression as an lvalue. Knowing the cfg member type and its interface helps confirm whether macros/functions could legally and actually assign to parameter names.\n\n(PRIu8/PRIu32/PRId32 are format macros only and do not affect parameter assignment; they need not be inspected for this MISRA rule.)"
