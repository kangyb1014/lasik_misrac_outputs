  "explanation": "You must inspect any macros, called functions, and involved types that could hide compiler-specific language extensions. Reasons:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked in the function (int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it may use compiler extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, builtin functions, GCC token-pasting/##__VA_ARGS__ patterns, etc.). If it is a function it may be declared with compiler-specific attributes. Its definition/declaration is required.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same as LFS_LOCK \u2014 used after the trace and may hide extensions in its macro or function declaration/definition.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This is a variadic-looking tracing macro usage (LFS_TRACE(\"...\", ...)). Tracing macros commonly use variadic macros, token pasting, statement-expressions, or compiler builtins. You must see its definition to detect any language extensions.\n\n- lfs_dir_read_: The direct callee; its prototype or definition may be declared with compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or attributes (e.g., __attribute__, calling conventions, inline definitions using extensions). Also its body could reveal whether target-level behavior relies on extensions.\n\n- lfs_t: The type of the first parameter; its definition is needed to inspect the cfg member and overall type declarations for any compiler-specific extensions (bit-field widths, unnamed fields, attributes on the type, flexible-array usage with non-standard extensions, etc.).\n\n- lfs_dir_t: The directory handle type passed in; its definition may contain attributes or extensions that affect use in this function (pointer casts, alignment, packed attributes, etc.).\n\n- struct lfs_info: The info structure passed to the call; its declaration may include compiler extensions or attributes that change function behavior or violation assessment.\n\nCollect these symbol definitions/declarations (macros and types and the callee signature/body) so the next analyzer can expand macros and examine any use of compiler-specific language extensions hidden outside the target function body."
