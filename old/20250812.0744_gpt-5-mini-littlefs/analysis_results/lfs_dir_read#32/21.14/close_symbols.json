  "explanation": "- lfs_dir_read_: immediate callee of the target. The target only forwards work to this function, so any use of memcmp that would violate the MISRA rule will occur here or in its callees.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: a direct callee of lfs_dir_read_. Need its body to see whether it calls memcmp and what operands (buffers/strings) it compares.\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: another direct callee of lfs_dir_read_. Must inspect it for memcmp usage and the nature of the compared data.\n- lfs_t: type of the first parameter passed through the call chain. Its fields may hold buffers/strings (pointers, sizes, configuration) that are passed down and compared; the type definition is needed to determine whether compared data are null-terminated strings.\n- lfs_dir_t: type of the second parameter; its fields may contain name buffers or pointers that could be passed to memcmp. Need its definition to determine whether those buffers are NUL-terminated strings.\n- struct lfs_info: third-parameter type whose members (e.g. name buffers) are likely the subject of comparisons. Inspecting its definition reveals whether fields are null-terminated strings (so a memcmp on them would violate MISRA).\n- memcmp: the standard function to check for in the callee implementations. You need to locate calls to memcmp and examine the operands and their documented/actual semantics to decide whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (which MISRA forbids).\n\nNote: When inspecting lfs_dir_read_, lfs_dir_fetch, and lfs_dir_getinfo, also collect any transitive callees and the definitions of any buffer/field symbols passed into memcmp (e.g. concrete name/size fields). Those transitive symbols should be added if they appear as operands to memcmp during code review."
