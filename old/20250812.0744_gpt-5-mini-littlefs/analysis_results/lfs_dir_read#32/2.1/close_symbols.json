  "explanation": "To determine whether any statements in lfs_dir_read are unreachable you must know any macros/functions that can alter control flow or never return, and the callee behavior:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked at the start and its expansion/definition may perform a non-local control transfer (e.g. return, longjmp, exit) or always return a particular value (e.g. always non-zero) which could make the rest of the function unreachable. You need its precise definition or prototype.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although placed near the end, its definition could also include non-local control flow (or be implemented as a return), which would affect reachability of subsequent code paths or the final return. Provide its definition/prototype.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros sometimes expand to complex statements (including control-flow statements) or to nothing. Its expansion could introduce or remove reachable code; include its definition to rule out unexpected control transfers.\n\n- lfs_dir_read_: This is the direct callee. If lfs_dir_read_ never returns (e.g. calls exit/longjmp) or always returns in a way that makes later statements unreachable, the LFS_TRACE after the call and the LFS_UNLOCK may be unreachable. Provide the full definition of lfs_dir_read_.\n\n- lfs_t (definition and type of its cfg member): LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg; the exact type and layout may be required to understand how the LFS_LOCK macro expands (it may reference fields or inline functions of cfg). Include the lfs_t definition (and the type of cfg) so macros can be correctly expanded and analyzed.\n\nProviding these symbols/definitions lets a static analyzer determine whether any statement in lfs_dir_read can never be executed (violating MISRA's unreachable code rule)."
