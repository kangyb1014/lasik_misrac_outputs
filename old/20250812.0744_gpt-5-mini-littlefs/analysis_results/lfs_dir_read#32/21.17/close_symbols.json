  "explanation": "- lfs_dir_read_: The direct callee; its implementation must be inspected for any use of string.h functions (memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, etc.) and for how it passes buffers/lengths.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Called by lfs_dir_read_; may contain string.h calls or buffer copies. Must be checked.\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: Called by lfs_dir_read_; likely fills struct lfs_info (e.g. file/dir names) and may perform string operations \u2014 needed to verify bounds.\n- lfs_t (definition): The filesystem context contains pointers/fields (notably cfg) and possibly temporary buffers used in string ops; its layout is required to determine object sizes and valid ranges.\n- lfs_dir_t (definition): Directory iterator/state structure may embed buffers or pointers used as sources/destinations in string operations; its fields are needed to assess sizes.\n- struct lfs_info (definition): Holds destination buffers for names/info returned to the caller; you must know the declared array sizes to check for potential overflows from string.h calls.\n- lfs->cfg type / lfs_config (definition): Configuration typically contains limits (max name length, block size, etc.) used to bound copies; these limits are required to determine if copies respect sizes.\n- name/filename length constants (e.g. LFS_NAME_MAX or cfg->name_max): Any compile-time or config constants that limit string lengths are needed to judge whether string.h calls can exceed object bounds.\n- LFS_LOCK macro and LFS_UNLOCK macro: They expand at call site; while unlikely to perform string.h operations, their expansions should be checked to ensure no indirect string.h usage or pointer modification that affects buffer validity.\n- LFS_TRACE macro/function: Tracing may format or copy strings; inspect its definition to confirm it does not use string.h functions in a way that could access buffers out-of-bounds.\n\nTogether these symbols let the next analyst locate all uses of the <string.h> functions and determine the sizes/limits of source and destination objects so the MISRA C rule (no out-of-bounds accesses by string.h functions) can be judged."
