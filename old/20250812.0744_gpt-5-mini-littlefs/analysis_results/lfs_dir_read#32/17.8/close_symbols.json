  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: macro/function invoked with lfs->cfg. A macro expansion could contain assignments that reference the token(s) passed (e.g. lfs), so we must inspect its definition to ensure it does not assign to the parameter variable lfs itself. Even if it writes the object lfs->cfg, that is allowed; we need to confirm it does not reassign the pointer parameter.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK (called with lfs->cfg). Verify it does not modify the pointer parameter variables.\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro called with (void*)lfs, (void*)dir, (void*)info and with the return value. As a macro it could expand to code that (accidentally) assigns to identifiers passed in; check its definition to ensure it does not modify any of the parameter variables.\n- lfs_dir_read_: the function called from lfs_dir_read. If it is actually a macro or inline function it could expand into code that modifies caller locals; inspect its definition/implementation to ensure no assignment to the caller's parameter identifiers (or to the parameter variables in this function via macro expansion). If it is a normal function, its body cannot modify the caller's parameter variables, but confirm whether it is an inline/macro.\n- lfs_t, lfs_dir_t, struct lfs_info: type/struct definitions are needed to know the fields (e.g. lfs->cfg) and to determine what expressions like lfs->cfg refer to (an object vs a pointer), so we can distinguish allowed modification of pointee subobjects from forbidden reassignment of the pointer parameter itself."
