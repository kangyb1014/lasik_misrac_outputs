  "explanation": "You must inspect any macros/functions expanded inside lfs_stat because MISRA rule concerns modification of the function's parameters (the local parameter variables lfs, path, info). Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: likely a macro or inline function; its expansion could take the address of or assign to the parameter variables (for example, via helper macros), so you must see its definition to ensure it does not modify the parameter variables themselves.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion could modify parameter variables; check its definition.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: a logging macro often implemented as a variadic macro. Because it is expanded in-place, it could contain code that takes addresses of or assigns to parameters (or uses temporary assignments). You need its definition to verify it does not modify the parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_stat_: although shown as a callee, confirm whether it is a real function or a macro/inline that could be expanded in-place. If it is a plain function, it cannot change the caller's parameter variables (C is pass-by-value). If it is a macro/inline that receives or manipulates the parameter identifiers, it could modify them; so its definition is required to rule that out.\n\n- lfs_t (type/definition): to understand what lfs->cfg expands to and whether any macro uses compound statements or assignments involving fields that might rewrite the parameter variable (e.g., if macros rely on container_of-like constructs). Having the lfs_t layout also helps recognise whether any member access in macros resolves to expressions that could rebind the parameter identifier.\n\n- struct lfs_info (type/definition): included for completeness to check whether any macro expands into code that could write into or rebind the info parameter (or take its address) in a way that would modify the parameter variable rather than the pointed-to object.\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyser determine whether any in-place macro expansion or inline definition in lfs_stat modifies the parameter variables (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
