  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: these are macros or wrappers used for locking in the target. Their definitions must be inspected to see if they use compiler extensions (e.g. statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, inline assembly, __attribute__ annotations, or other non-standard builtins). If they are functions, their declarations might carry compiler-specific attributes.\\n- LFS_TRACE: this logging macro/function is invoked with format strings and casts; its macro/body must be checked for language extensions (variadic-macro usage beyond standard, GCC statement-expressions, __builtin_* usage, __attribute__((...)), inline asm, etc.).\\n- lfs_stat_: the called internal function\u2019s declaration/definition must be checked for any non-standard function attributes or language-extension usage (inline assembly, __attribute__, builtin intrinsics, non-standard parameter types).\\n- lfs_t: the typedef/struct for lfs_t (including the cfg member type) is needed because the code uses lfs->cfg with LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; the cfg type or lfs_t definition might include compiler-specific extensions (packed attributes, bit-field extensions, anonymous structs/unions, or non-standard storage-class specifiers).\\n- struct lfs_info: the definition of this structure must be checked for any language extensions on fields (attributes, anonymous/unnamed members, nonstandard bit-field usage, flexible-array variations that rely on extensions).\\n\nEach listed symbol is required because the target function is simple and all potential MISRA violations from language extensions would come from the macros, the called function declaration/definition, or the involved types; inspecting those symbols is necessary to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used."
