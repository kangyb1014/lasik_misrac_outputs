  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA const-pointer rule you must know whether any pointer parameters could or should be const and whether they are modified. Specifically:\n- lfs_fs_grow_: needed to see its parameter types (does it take lfs_t * or const lfs_t *) and whether it writes through the lfs pointer or other pointers derived from it.\n- lfs_t: the definition of the filesystem object is required to determine which members are pointers, their types, and whether members are declared const; this shows whether passing lfs as non-const is necessary.\n- type of lfs->cfg (e.g. struct lfs_config / cfg typedef): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg; need the cfg type to know if those APIs require a non-const pointer or modify the config object.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: their definitions/prototypes (or macro expansions) reveal whether they accept/modify non-const pointers (and therefore whether passing a non-const cfg/lfs is required).\n- lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_commit: these are direct callees (via lfs_fs_grow_) that likely read or modify directory structures or state reachable from lfs; their prototypes/definitions show whether they modify objects passed via pointers (and whether those pointer parameters are const-qualified).\n- lfs_superblock_fromle32 and lfs_superblock_tole32: these conversion helpers are listed as callees of lfs_fs_grow_ \u2014 their prototypes show whether they take pointers to const or non-const superblock structures (i.e., whether they write to the pointed objects).\n\nProviding these symbols (prototypes/definitions and relevant struct/type declarations) lets the analyzer determine whether any pointer could be const-qualified or must remain non-const because the pointed object is modified by the target or its callees."
