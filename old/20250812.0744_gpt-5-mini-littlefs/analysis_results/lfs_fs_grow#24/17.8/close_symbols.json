  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: may be a macro or function; if a macro it could expand to code that assigns to function parameters or otherwise has side-effects on local parameter identifiers. Need the definition to verify it does not modify the parameter variables (lfs or block_count).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 a macro expansion could perform assignments or otherwise modify parameter identifiers; verify its definition.\n- LFS_TRACE: typically a macro or inline logging function that takes the parameters; its expansion could contain side-effects (assignments, uses of parameter names). Inspect to ensure it does not modify the formal parameters.\n- lfs_fs_grow_: include the definition because it might be a macro or inline that expands in caller scope (and thus could modify caller parameters). If it is an ordinary function, its body cannot reassign the caller's parameter variables, but the definition confirms this.\n- lfs_t: the structure/type definition is required to confirm that the first parameter is a pointer type and to inspect the cfg member (passed to lock/unlock). Also needed to ensure there are no weird typedefs or macros that would change how the parameter name behaves.\n- lfs_size_t: the typedef/definition of the second parameter's type is required to confirm it is an ordinary scalar type (passed by value) and not a pointer alias or macro that could lead to unexpected modification of the parameter identifier.\n\nInspecting these symbols will allow determining whether any macro expansions or inlined code in the call site actually perform assignments to the formal parameters (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
