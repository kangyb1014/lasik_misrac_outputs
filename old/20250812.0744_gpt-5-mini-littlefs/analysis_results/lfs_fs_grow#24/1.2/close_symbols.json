  "explanation": "For checking violations of the MISRA rule banning compiler language extensions we must inspect any macros, functions and types used by lfs_fs_grow that could hide compiler-specific extensions or attributes. Specifically:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: Could be a macro or inline function that uses GCC/clang extensions (statement-expression, typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, variadic macro tricks). Need its definition/declaration to detect such extensions.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK; inspect definition to ensure no compiler-specific constructs.\n- LFS_TRACE: Almost certainly a macro or function-like logging facility; it may use variadic macros, GCC statement-expressions, __attribute__((format(...))) or other extensions. Its full definition is required.\n- lfs_fs_grow_ (prototype/definition): The call target might carry compiler-specific function attributes (calling conventions, __attribute__, inline semantics) or be defined with extension features that affect whether the call site uses extensions. Include its declaration/definition.\n- lfs_t (typedef/struct): The type of the first parameter may include compiler extensions in its definition (packed attributes, bit-field extensions, __attribute__ annotations). Need the type definition to check for such uses.\n- lfs_size_t (typedef): The integer size typedef could be an alias defined using compiler-specific constructs; include its typedef to verify it is standard C.\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg field type): lfs_fs_grow uses lfs->cfg as an argument to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; the cfg field's type may include extensions or attributes (e.g., function-like macros accessing internals). Its definition is required.\n- PRIu32 (macro from <inttypes.h>): The format macro used in the TRACE string should be verified that it is the standard macro (from inttypes.h) and not a project/compiler-specific extension.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions/declarations) allows the next analyzer to determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used directly or indirectly by lfs_fs_grow."
