  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_grow_: direct callee of the target. Any use of memcmp in this function (or the way it passes buffers/strings to lower-level calls) is the most likely source of a MISRA violation and must be inspected.  \n- lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_commit: these are direct callees of lfs_fs_grow_. If lfs_fs_grow_ delegates string/buffer comparisons to directory functions, those functions may call memcmp (or otherwise compare C strings) and must be examined to determine whether memcmp is being used on null-terminated strings.  \n- lfs_superblock_fromle32, lfs_superblock_tole32: included because they appear in the callee list of lfs_fs_grow_. Although these look like byte/endianness helpers (less likely to compare C strings), they must still be checked for any memcmp usage or string comparisons that could trigger the MISRA rule.  \n- memcmp: the Standard Library function in question. To judge a MISRA violation you must find all call sites to memcmp reachable from lfs_fs_grow (directly or in callees) and inspect the actual arguments to determine whether they are null-terminated C strings (which would violate the rule)."
