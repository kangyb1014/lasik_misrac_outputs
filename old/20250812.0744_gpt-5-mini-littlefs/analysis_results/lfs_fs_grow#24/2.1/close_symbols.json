  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: macro or function that controls entry to the function (err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)). You must inspect its definition/attributes (e.g. could be a non-returning call, longjmp/exit, infinite loop, or expand to code that changes control flow) to decide whether the subsequent statements are reachable.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: unlocking macro/function called at the end. If LFS_UNLOCK has non-standard control-flow (noreturn, longjmp), it affects reachability of code after calls; its definition is required to determine whether the final statements are reachable or create unreachable tail code.\n- LFS_TRACE: trace macro used twice. Macros can expand to nothing or to constructs that affect control flow (e.g. do { if (cond) return; } while(0)). The expansion must be checked to be sure trace invocations do not make surrounding code unreachable.\n- lfs_fs_grow_: the core helper called by lfs_fs_grow. If lfs_fs_grow_ is declared with noreturn, calls exit/longjmp, or otherwise does not return on some paths, then code after the call (trace/unlock/return) may be unreachable. You need the function body/attributes to decide reachability.\n- lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_superblock_fromle32, lfs_superblock_tole32, lfs_dir_commit: these are the callees of lfs_fs_grow_. To determine whether lfs_fs_grow_ (and therefore code after its call) can return on all paths you must inspect its callees for non-returning behavior or constructs that make parts of lfs_fs_grow_ unreachable.\n- lfs_t: the type of the first parameter; its definition (particularly the cfg member type) is needed because LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg and macros/functions can use that field in ways that affect control flow.\n- lfs_size_t: the typedef used for block_count. Needed to ensure no unusual attributes (e.g. volatile, function pointer typedef) that could influence control-flow analysis.\n\nMinimal set: the lock/unlock/trace macros, the implementation/signature of lfs_fs_grow_, its transitive callees (listed), and the lfs types. These are required to determine whether any statements in lfs_fs_grow are syntactically or effectively unreachable (per MISRA) due to called-symbol definitions or macro expansions."
