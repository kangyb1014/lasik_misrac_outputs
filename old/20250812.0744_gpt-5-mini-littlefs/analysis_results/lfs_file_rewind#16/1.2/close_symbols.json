  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function definition)\n  - The call in the target is LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro its expansion may use compiler extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof/__typeof__, __attribute__, inline assembly, builtin intrinsics, or other non\u2011standard constructs). If it is an inline/static function it may use compiler-specific keywords or attributes. You must inspect the actual definition to decide whether a language extension is used.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definition)\n  - Same rationale as LFS_LOCK: the unlock primitive may be a macro or function-like macro that hides extensions. Its definition must be inspected for any non\u2011standard constructs.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition)\n  - LFS_TRACE is called with a printf-like format and variadic arguments. Its implementation may be a variadic macro (##__VA_ARGS__), use GCC attributes (format), or other extensions (statement expressions, __builtin_* calls). Check the macro/function definition to see if it employs compiler extensions.\n\n- lfs_file_rewind_ (function definition)\n  - The target delegates the main work to this helper. The helper\u2019s implementation may be declared with non\u2011standard attributes (e.g. GCC __attribute__((...))), use inline or nested functions, or call macros that use extensions. To be sure the translation unit containing the target does not rely on extensions, inspect this function definition.\n\n- lfs_file_seek_ (function definition)\n  - According to the static call graph lfs_file_rewind_ calls lfs_file_seek_. If any extension is used in the callee chain that is visible/required inlined into the target translation unit (e.g. inline definitions, macros expanded in callers), it may affect whether the target\u2019s compilation uses extensions. Include the callee definition to inspect for such uses.\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition, including its cfg member type)\n  - The target accesses lfs->cfg. The type of lfs->cfg (and lfs_t itself) may be typedefs or macro-based aliases that use compiler extensions (anonymous structs/unions as GCC extension, bit-field extensions, attributes on types). Inspect the type definitions to ensure no language extensions are used in the types referenced by the target.\n\n- lfs_file_t (type/struct definition)\n  - The target accepts a lfs_file_t* parameter. Its definition could use anonymous unions/structs or other compiler extensions. The parameter type must be checked for non\u2011standard constructs.\n\n- Header(s) that define the LFS_* macros / configuration (e.g. lfs.h or config header)\n  - Macro definitions and configuration macros are often collected in public headers. The complete header(s) that supply LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE and the lfs_* type definitions are needed to find any use of language extensions (compiler builtins, attributes, statement expressions, nested functions, typeof, asm, etc.).\n\nNotes\n- The items above are the minimal program symbols you must inspect to determine whether the target function (as compiled in its translation unit) uses compiler language extensions. When inspecting each definition look specifically for known compiler-specific constructs (e.g. __attribute__, __extension__, __builtin_*, __typeof__/typeof, ({ ... }) statement-expressions, asm/nested functions, labels-as-values, non\u2011standard inline semantics, variadic macro tricks that rely on vendor behavior)."
