  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: macro or function definition is required because it is invoked with the expression lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK is a macro that expands into statements in the caller context it could reference or assign to the local identifier lfs or file (thus modifying the function parameter). Even if a function, its macro-definition (or wrapper) must be checked for side-effects that reassign parameter variables.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock primitive may be a macro that expands in-place and could modify the parameter identifiers; its definition must be inspected to ensure it does not assign to lfs or file.\n- LFS_TRACE: tracing is usually a macro; if it expands into code that references or assigns the identifiers lfs or file (or rebinds them) it could modify the parameter variables. Include its definition to confirm it doesn't alter parameter variables.\n- lfs_file_rewind_: the callee name must be inspected because it might be a macro (rather than a true function). If it is a macro that expands inline in the caller, it could modify the caller's parameter variables. If it is a normal function, modifications inside it do not violate the MISRA rule for the caller, but you need to confirm which form it has.\n- lfs_t (type / struct definition): the type definition is needed to understand whether expressions like lfs->cfg are valid and whether any macros might expand into assignments to the pointer itself vs. fields of the pointed-to object. Also useful for confirming whether any macro uses field accesses that could shadow or rebind the parameter name.\n- lfs_file_t (type / struct definition): similar to lfs_t: required to reason about any macro expansions that access file members and to ensure no macro uses an identifier collision that would reassign the parameter variable.\n\n(Collecting the above symbol definitions lets the analyzer determine whether any macro expansions or inlined code in the call chain write to the formal parameter variables lfs or file, which is what the MISRA rule forbids.)"
