  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_rewind code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/133.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_rewind as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_rewind:\n```c\nint lfs_file_rewind(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n\n    err = lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_rewind -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_rewind:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic int lfs_file_rewind_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_seek_(lfs, file, 0, LFS_SEEK_SET);\n    if (res < 0) {\n        return (int)res;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_rewind code violates the rule 17.8 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: lfs_file_rewind takes pointer parameters (lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) but does not modify those pointer parameters themselves. It only reads lfs->cfg, passes the pointers to LFS_TRACE and to the helper lfs_file_rewind_, and returns the result. Modifying the object pointed-to (for example, via lfs_file_rewind_ calling lfs_file_seek_) is permitted by the rule. Therefore Rule 17.8 is not violated.",
