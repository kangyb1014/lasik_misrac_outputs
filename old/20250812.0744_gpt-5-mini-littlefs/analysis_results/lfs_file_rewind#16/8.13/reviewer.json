Therefore lfs could be declared as const lfs_t *lfs. Not qualifying this pointer as const violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). The file pointer parameter is modified by the helper lfs_file_rewind_, so it must remain non-const.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void LFS_TRACE(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/131.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (f == NULL) {\n        return;\n    }\n    va_list ap;\n    va_start(ap, fmt);\n    vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n    fputc('\\n', f);\n    va_end(ap);\n    fclose(f);\n}\nstatic int LFS_LOCK(void *cfg)\n{\n    /* Log that lock was requested and the cfg pointer value.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 says a pointer parameter should be to a const-qualified type whenever possible, but it also allows a non-const pointer when the pointer is used by the function (or by callees) in a way that requires mutability. In lfs_file_rewind the lfs parameter is forwarded to lfs_file_rewind_(lfs, file), which is declared to take lfs_t * (non-const). Because lfs_file_rewind passes the pointer to a callee that accepts a non-const lfs_t *, you cannot safely change the lfs parameter to const lfs_t * without changing the callee(s) as well (or performing a cast that would discard qualifiers). Similarly, passing lfs->cfg into LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK (which take void *) would require discarding const if lfs were declared const. Therefore, as written the function signature is appropriate and does not violate Rule 8.13. If the entire call chain guarantees that the object is never modified, the correct remedy would be to propagate const through the callee signatures (change lfs_file_rewind_ and any other callers to accept const lfs_t *), not to change only this function. The provided test code failed to compile likely because required type definitions (lfs_t, lfs_file_t) were not present; that does not change the correctness of the rule assessment."
