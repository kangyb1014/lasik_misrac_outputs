  "explanation": "- struct lfs_t (definition): needed to know the exact type of the lfs parameter and the type/qualifiers of its member cfg (e.g. whether cfg is a const-qualified pointer). The MISRA rule concerns whether pointers can/should be const, so the struct definition is required to see existing const qualifiers.\n- struct lfs_file_t (definition): required to determine whether the file parameter or fields inside it are const-qualified and whether the target or callees modify the object pointed to by file.\n- lfs_file_rewind_ (prototype and implementation): the target function forwards to this helper. Its signature and body determine whether it (or its callees) modify *file or *lfs and thus whether the pointer parameters should be non-const; this is central to the MISRA check.\n- lfs_file_seek_ (prototype and implementation): static call graph shows lfs_file_rewind_ calls lfs_file_seek_. lfs_file_seek_ may perform modifications to the file object; its signature/body are needed to see if a pointer is modified and whether parameters could be const-qualified.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function declaration): lfs_file_rewind calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). To judge const-correctness we must know the lock API's parameter type (does it require a const or non-const pointer) and whether it mutates the object passed.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function declaration): same reason as LFS_LOCK for the unlock operation; its parameter type/signature may force non-const usage.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function declaration): although tracing typically does not modify objects, its prototype/macros may cast or take non-const pointers; include it to confirm it does not force removal of const qualifiers.\n\nCollecting these symbols (definitions and implementations where applicable) lets the next analyzer determine whether any pointer parameters should be const-qualified or must be non-const because the function or its callees modify the pointed-to objects."
