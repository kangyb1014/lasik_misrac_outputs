  "explanation": "- lfs_file_rewind_: Direct callee of the target. Its implementation is required because it may perform memory or string operations (or call other functions that do). You must inspect it to see if any memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/\u2026 calls (or uses of buffers) could access out of bounds.\n- lfs_file_seek_: Known callee of lfs_file_rewind_. It likely manipulates file offsets, buffers, and sector caches; its implementation (and any uses of string.h functions inside it) must be examined to determine possible out-of-bounds accesses.\n- lfs_t (struct): The target reads lfs->cfg; lfs_t may contain global buffers, cache pointers, buffer sizes, and state that determine valid object bounds for memory operations. Field layouts and types are needed to reason about pointer targets and sizes.\n- lfs_file_t (struct): File object layout (buffers, cached sector, buffer size, current position, end-of-file, etc.) is necessary to determine the valid ranges of pointers/arrays that file operations read from or write to.\n- lfs_config / cfg fields used by file APIs: Configuration parameters (block size, prog_size, read_size, cache sizes, buffer pointers) directly affect buffer lengths and offsets used in memcpy/memmove/memset; these values are required to check bound correctness.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: Provide the locking semantics and may expand to functions/macros that access lfs or cfg; include their definitions to ensure they don't perform hidden buffer operations affecting analysis.\n- LFS_TRACE: Trace macro could expand to snprintf/printf-like calls that use string functions; include its definition to ensure no unsafe string.h usage is hidden in the tracing infrastructure.\n- All direct and transitive callees of lfs_file_seek_ (implementations): Any functions reachable from lfs_file_seek_ may contain the actual uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/strcpy/\u2026; include their implementations to fully determine whether any string.h calls access memory beyond the bounds of their pointer parameters.\n\nInclude these symbols/definitions so the next analyst can trace every place a standard string.h function might be called and verify buffer sizes and pointer targets to check MISRA rule compliance."
