  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 is: The Standard Library function memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings.\n\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_tell code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/78.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_tell as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_tell:\n```c\nlfs_soff_t lfs_file_tell(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_tell_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_tell -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_tell:\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n...\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_tell_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    (void)lfs;\n    return file->pos;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_tell code violates the rule 21.14 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the provided code and nearby functions do not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. lfs_file_tell performs a lock, logs, asserts that the file is open via lfs_mlist_isopen (which uses pointer equality in a loop), calls lfs_file_tell_ (which returns file->pos), logs the result, unlocks, and returns. There are no string comparisons or calls to memcmp in the shown code, so MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 is not violated.",
