  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for language-extensions (MISRA):\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro or function used at the start of the function. Its definition may contain compiler extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, builtins, GCC extension macros, etc.) or use non-standard linkage/attributes. Inspecting its definition is required to decide if an extension is used.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its implementation/definition may hide compiler-specific extensions or attributes that would violate the rule.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros often use variadic macros, GCC statement-expressions, __builtin_expect, __attribute__, or other extensions. The trace call here concatenates a format string with PRId32; the macro definition must be inspected for language extensions (variadic macro usage is C99 but some compilers treat it as extension; other constructs may be non-standard).\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macros commonly use __FILE__, __LINE__ (standard), but may also use compiler extensions (e.g., typeof, statement-expression, __attribute__, inline assembler, or other non-standard behaviour). The macro definition is needed to determine compliance.\n\n- lfs_soff_t: The return type of the function. Its typedef/definition must be checked for use of non-standard integer types, extension attributes (e.g., __attribute__((packed)), bit-field width using non-standard widths, or compiler-specific typedefs) that would constitute language extensions.\n\n- lfs_t: The main filesystem/context type. Its struct/typedef must be inspected because members (cfg, mlist) or annotations could use compiler-specific extensions or attributes.\n\n- lfs_file_t: The file handle type passed into the function. Its definition could use anonymous unions/structs or compiler-specific attributes/extensions; the cast to (struct lfs_mlist*) suggests relationship that should be verified.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: Used in the explicit cast in the ASSERT; the struct definition must be checked for anonymous members, flexible array members, or compiler-specific extensions/attributes that would violate MISRA.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: The called function inside LFS_ASSERT \u2014 its prototype/definition is needed to ensure no non-standard calling conventions, attributes, or extension usage are introduced through that symbol.\n\n- lfs_file_tell_: The internal helper called and whose return is forwarded. Its prototype/definition must be checked for attributes or extension usage (calling conventions, inline asm, visibility attributes, non-standard types) that could make the wrapper indirectly use language extensions.\n\n- PRId32: The printf-format macro is used by concatenation in the LFS_TRACE argument. Although PRId32 is from the standard inttypes.h (C99), you must verify the build environment and header usage (or any redefinition in the project) to ensure it is not a project/system header that uses compiler-specific extensions or non-standard macros.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions/prototypes/typedefs of the listed macros, types and called functions because language extensions may be hidden there (macros using GNU extensions, attributes, statement-expressions, asm, non-standard type definitions, anonymous/unnamed fields, etc.)."
