  "explanation": "You must be able to inspect any macro expansions and type/member definitions that could cause the parameter variables `lfs` or `file` to be assigned to (which would violate MISRA\u2019s \u201cparameter shall not be modified\u201d). Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked with the expression `lfs->cfg`. If LFS_LOCK is a macro it may expand into code that assigns to its argument expression; we need to verify it cannot assign to the parameter variable `lfs` (or otherwise perform an assignment that changes the pointer variable itself).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 check the expansion for any assignment or side-effect that could modify the `lfs` parameter variable.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Called with `(void*)lfs` and `(void*)file`; if this is a macro it could expand into code that uses the tokens `lfs` or `file` in a way that assigns to them. Inspect expansion to ensure it only reads/casts and does not modify the parameter variables.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Wraps the call to `lfs_mlist_isopen(...)`. If a macro, it may expand into control-flow or assignments that reference the argument tokens; confirm it does not modify `lfs` or `file` variables.\n\n- lfs_file_tell_: The call `lfs_file_tell_(lfs, file)` could be a function or a macro. If it is a macro, its expansion might reference the parameter names or perform assignments that affect the caller\u2019s parameter variables. The definition/declaration is required to rule that out.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Used inside LFS_ASSERT. If this is a macro (or its prototype has unusual attributes) we must inspect it to ensure the call site (or macro expansion) does not modify the `file` or `lfs` parameter variables.\n\n- struct lfs_t: We need the type definition to confirm that `lfs->cfg` and `lfs->mlist` are ordinary members (not implemented via weird macros/tricks) and to ensure there is no macro/overload that would cause the token `lfs` to be redefined or otherwise modified by member access.\n\n- typedef/struct for lfs_file / struct lfs_mlist: The parameter `file` is cast to `struct lfs_mlist*` in the call. We need the type/typedef definitions to ensure there are no macro-based shenanigans (or name collisions) that could cause the token `file` to be modified by the cast or by the called macros/functions.\n\nCollecting these symbols (macro definitions and the indicated type/function/macro definitions) lets you expand macros and read declarations to determine whether any code path in lfs_file_tell assigns to the parameter variables `lfs` or `file` (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
