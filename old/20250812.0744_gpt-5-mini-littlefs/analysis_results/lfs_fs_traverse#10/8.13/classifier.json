  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_fs_traverse code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/83.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_fs_traverse as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_fs_traverse:\n```c\nint lfs_fs_traverse(lfs_t *lfs, int (*cb)(void *, lfs_block_t), void *data) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_traverse(%p, %p, %p)\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)(uintptr_t)cb, data);\n\n    err = lfs_fs_traverse_(lfs, cb, data, true);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_traverse -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_fs_traverse code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The lfs pointer must be non-const because the function calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg), which operate on and potentially modify the state of lfs->cfg (a member of the object pointed to by lfs). The callback parameter cb takes a void *data rather than const void * because the callback may modify the object pointed to by data; lfs_fs_traverse forwards data to that callback. Therefore pointers are correctly non-const and Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
