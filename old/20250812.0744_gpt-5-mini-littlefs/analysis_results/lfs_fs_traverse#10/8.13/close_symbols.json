  "explanation": "For checking whether pointer parameters in lfs_fs_traverse should be const-qualified we must determine whether this function or any callee modifies the objects pointed to by those pointers (or requires non-const pointers). - lfs_fs_traverse_: needed to see exactly how the parameters (lfs, cb, data) are used/passed on, and whether they are modified or forwarded to modifying APIs. - lfs_t struct: to know the types and mutability of fields (notably cfg) that are passed to lock/unlock and callees; whether lfs itself is modified. - lfs_block_t: to know the block type used by the callback (affects callback prototype correctness). - callback prototype (int (*cb)(void *, lfs_block_t)): to determine whether the callback is allowed/expected to modify the data pointer; if the traverse must permit mutation, data cannot be const. - LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK and type of lfs->cfg: these are called with lfs->cfg; their prototypes indicate whether they take const pointers or mutate cfg/state (affects whether cfg or lfs must be non-const). - LFS_TRACE: may take pointer arguments; its prototype/macros show whether it accepts const pointers or requires non-const. - All lfs_fs_traverse_ callees from the static call graph (lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_tortoise_detectcycles, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_ctz_fromle32, lfs_tag_type3, lfs_ctz_traverse): each symbol's prototype/implementation is required to see whether any of them are invoked with pointers originating from lfs_fs_traverse parameters (lfs, data or buffers derived therefrom) and whether they modify the referenced objects or accept only const pointers. Collectively these symbols let an analyst trace pointer flows and usages to decide whether parameters to lfs_fs_traverse (and forwarded pointers) can/should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
