  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for dead-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: the function called by the target. You must inspect its body to know what operations are actually executed (e.g. whether it calls the cb callback, performs I/O, changes state). Whether parts of the target wrapper are redundant depends on what the underlying traversal does.\n\n- LFS_LOCK: the wrapper calls this and returns early on non-zero. Its semantics (side effects, whether it can return failure, observable effects) determine whether the lock call and the early-return are necessary or could be removed safely.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: paired with LFS_LOCK. You must know whether unlocking has observable effects (and whether unlocking is necessary when traversal returns) before deeming it removable.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro. Many projects compile-out trace macros or make them no-ops; if LFS_TRACE expands to nothing (or has no side effects), the trace calls in this function would be dead code. You must inspect the macro/implementation to determine if its removal affects program behaviour (including argument evaluation side effects).\n\n- lfs_t (type and its ->cfg field) and cfg type: to know what object is locked/unlocked and whether locking/unlocking this cfg has observable effects beyond this function (e.g. global/shared state). The type definition can reveal side-effectful members or alignment that affect behaviour.\n\n- cb and lfs_block_t: the callback type and block type definitions plus any documented semantics. If the traversal invokes cb, then passing cb through is meaningful; if cb is never invoked by lfs_fs_traverse_, then the cb parameter (and related code) might be dead. Also argument evaluation side effects of cb (if any) must be considered.\n\n- The callees of lfs_fs_traverse_ (lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_tortoise_detectcycles, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_ctz_fromle32, lfs_tag_type3, lfs_ctz_traverse): these functions implement traversal behaviour. To conclude whether operations performed by lfs_fs_traverse_ (and therefore the wrapper) are required, you need to inspect these to know if they produce observable side effects (state changes, I/O, timing) or call the cb. Dead-code determination depends on whether those side effects would change if the wrapper or parts of it were removed.\n\n- lfs_alloc_scan and lfs_fs_size_: callers of lfs_fs_traverse_. To determine whether the wrapper function itself is ever used (and thus whether it is unreachable vs potentially dead), you should find and inspect all callers. If the wrapper has no callers anywhere in the program/binary, it is unreachable (note: MISRA distinguishes unreachable from dead), but if callers exist only under certain build options, that affects the dead-code analysis.\n\n- Build/config macros that affect LFS_TRACE or locking (e.g. NDEBUG or project-specific trace/lock configuration): conditional compilation or build-time configuration can make calls no-ops or change semantics; you must know those definitions to decide whether the code is semantically removable.\n\nIn short: you need the definitions/implementations (or authoritative documentation) for the locking/unlocking and tracing macros, the traversal implementation (lfs_fs_traverse_) and its internal callees to see observable effects/callback invocation, the type definitions involved (lfs_t, cfg, lfs_block_t), and the set of callers/build-time configs that determine whether the wrapper is actually used. These symbols let you decide if any operation in the target is executed yet removable without changing program behaviour."
