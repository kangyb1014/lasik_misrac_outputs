  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_fs_traverse uses any compiler language extensions the analyser needs the definitions/decls of the following symbols:\n\n- uintptr_t: the code casts a function pointer through (uintptr_t). You must confirm uintptr_t is the standard typedef (from <stdint.h>) and not a compiler-specific extension or macro, and understand the portability/implementation-defined semantics of pointer\u2194integer conversions.\n\n- lfs_t: the target function takes a pointer to lfs_t and accesses lfs->cfg. The full type is needed to inspect any non\u2011standard attributes, bitfields, or compiler-specific decorations on the type that could be language extensions.\n\n- lfs_block_t: this appears in the callback prototype; knowing whether it is an ordinary integer type, a pointer type, or a typedef with attributes affects whether the function-pointer/integer/pointer casts are standard or rely on extensions.\n\n- struct lfs_config (type of lfs->cfg): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK operate on lfs->cfg. The config type definition is required to inspect whether those macros expand to code using compiler extensions (e.g. typeof, statement-expressions, __attribute__, inline asm) or non-standard locking primitives.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: these macros/functions perform locking in the function. Their definitions must be inspected to ensure they do not use compiler-specific extensions (GCC statement-expression ({ ... }), typeof, __builtin_*, attributes, or other non\u2011standard constructs).\n\n- LFS_TRACE: the logging macro is used with casts and format specifiers; its expansion may use variadic macro extensions, statement-expressions, attributes, or compiler-specific printf attributes \u2014 any of which would be language extensions. Also the macro determines whether the (void*)(uintptr_t)cb usage is intentionally relying on implementation-defined behaviour.\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: the called function's declaration/definition is required to check for function attributes or non-standard linkage (e.g. inline semantics, __attribute__((...)), asm labels) or any other extension that the caller depends on (calling-convention assumptions, etc.).\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyser determine whether any of the casts, macros, types, or called-declarations use compiler-specific extensions (and therefore violate the MISRA prohibition on language extensions)."
