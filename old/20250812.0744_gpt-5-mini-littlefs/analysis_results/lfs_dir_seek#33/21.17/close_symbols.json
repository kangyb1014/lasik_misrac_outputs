  "explanation": "Why each is required to check for string.h out\u2011of\u2011bounds usage:\n\n- lfs_dir_seek_: This is the immediate callee containing the actual seek logic. It may perform name/entry copying or compute lengths that lead to usage of memcpy/memmove/str*; its source is required to see whether any string.h functions are called and with what lengths/pointers.\n\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: Called by lfs_dir_seek_. It may reset directory state and touch buffers or call string functions; its code and buffer interactions are needed to understand ownership and valid ranges of pointers used later.\n\n- lfs_min: A utility used to bound copy lengths. You must inspect its definition to confirm how copy sizes are computed (off-by-one or signed/unsigned issues) which directly affect whether a string copy/memcpy stays within bounds.\n\n- lfs_pair_cmp: A comparator used by directory code. It may call memcmp or similar routines; its implementation is needed to see whether it reads beyond provided lengths or assumes NUL termination.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Likely responsible for reading raw directory entry bytes into in-memory structures or copying names into user buffers (common place for memcpy/strcpy). Its implementation is essential to check exact copy calls, source/destination lengths, and any bounds checks.\n\n- lfs_t (definition): The filesystem context contains pointers to configuration and buffer state (lfs->cfg, caches). You need the struct layout to know the types, lifetimes and sizes of buffers referenced by directory operations.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (definition): The directory object holds cursors, buffers, and pointers into directory data. Its fields determine valid ranges for copy operations and whether a pointer parameter can overflow.\n\n- lfs_off_t (typedef): The meaning, signedness and range of off influence copy length calculations and comparisons; mismatches (signed/unsigned) can cause under/overflows leading to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n\n- struct lfs_config / lfs->cfg definition: Configuration fields (block size, read_size, name maximums, buffer sizes) determine maximum legal copy sizes and buffer capacities used by directory reads/copies; you must check these to verify bounds.\n\n- LFS_NAME_MAX (or equivalent name-length limit constant): The maximum filename length is directly used to size name copies and buffer allocations. Knowing the constant is required to determine if name copies can exceed destination buffers.\n\n- On-disk directory entry layout / directory entry structs: The exact layout and size of directory entries (name length field, pair/key fields) are necessary to determine how many bytes will be copied from disk to memory and whether copying respects declared lengths.\n\n- Any buffer/cache structures used by the directory code: Directory functions frequently use intermediate read buffers or cache objects; their definitions and sizes are required to confirm that any memcpy/memmove operations do not exceed those buffers.\n\nIn short: include the implementations of lfs_dir_seek_ and its callees and the definitions of the filesystem, directory structures, configuration, and constants that determine copy sizes/buffer capacities. These symbols together let you find any uses of string.h functions, the exact source/destination pointers and lengths passed, and whether those calls can access beyond object bounds (MISRA rule)."
