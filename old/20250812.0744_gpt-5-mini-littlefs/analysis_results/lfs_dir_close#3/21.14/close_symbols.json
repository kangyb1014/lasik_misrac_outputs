  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for misuse of memcmp:\n\n- lfs_dir_close_: This is the immediate internal implementation called by the target. Any use of memcmp to compare strings could be inside this function, so its body must be inspected.\n- lfs_mlist_remove: Static call graph shows lfs_dir_close_ calls this function. It may perform list/member lookups or name comparisons that could use memcmp on null-terminated strings; inspect it.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros or functions used by the target for synchronization. Macros can expand to code that may call other helpers (or inline comparisons), so include their definitions to ensure no memcmp usage is hidden in the lock/unlock implementation.\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing/logging is a macro or function used in the target. Although unlikely, it can expand to helper code that may call utilities which in turn might call memcmp; include it to rule out hidden uses.\n- memcmp: The standard-library function itself \u2014 include this symbol to locate all direct calls and verify whether any call compares null-terminated strings (the MISRA issue).\n\nNote: If, when inspecting the above symbols, you discover additional callees (functions called by lfs_mlist_remove or by the macro expansions), include those as well and inspect them for memcmp usage."
