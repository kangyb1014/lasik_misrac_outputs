  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameters in lfs_dir_close should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule, the analyzer must know whether any of the called code or operations modify the objects pointed to. For that we need:\n\n- lfs_t (type/definition): to see what lfs->cfg is, whether any fields of *lfs are modified, and whether callers expect mutable lfs objects. The struct layout is required to judge if a const lfs_t * could be used.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (type/definition): to determine whether the function (or callees) write into fields of *dir; if dir's contents are modified then it must not be const. The struct fields and semantics are necessary.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (definition of the cfg member/type): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg; knowing the cfg type is required to examine whether these operations mutate the cfg object or require a non-const pointer (affecting whether lfs should be const-qualified).\n\n- lfs_dir_close_ (function declaration + definition): lfs_dir_close just forwards to this function; the implementation of lfs_dir_close_ must be inspected to see whether it modifies *lfs or *dir (directly or via callees). If it mutates them, const cannot be applied.\n\n- lfs_mlist_remove (function declaration + definition): static call graph shows lfs_dir_close_ calls this function. Its implementation may modify list nodes or the objects passed in; it must be checked to determine whether it writes through pointers passed from dir or lfs.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function definition): locking may modify the cfg or require a non-const pointer; if it writes to the cfg object, lfs cannot be const. Also need to know whether the macro takes its argument by non-const pointer only.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definition): same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 if it mutates cfg or requires non-const, that prevents const-qualification of lfs.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition): the trace macro is passed (void*) casts of lfs and dir. While typically non-mutating, its definition must be checked to ensure it does not modify the objects (or require non-const pointers) or perform operations that prevent changing parameter types to const.\n\nIn short, the types of the pointers and the full definitions of all directly and transitively called functions/macros are required to determine whether any writes occur through the lfs or dir pointers or whether any called routine requires non-const pointers. These symbols let the analyzer detect any modification or non-const API requirement and thus decide whether const qualification is permissible under the MISRA rule."
