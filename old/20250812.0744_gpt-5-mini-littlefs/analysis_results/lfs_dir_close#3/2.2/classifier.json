  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_dir_close code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/26.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_dir_close as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_close:\n```c\nint lfs_dir_close(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);\n\n    err = lfs_dir_close_(lfs, dir);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_dir_close code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function contains no dead code. All executed operations (the LFS_LOCK check and early return, the LFS_TRACE calls, the call to lfs_dir_close_, the LFS_UNLOCK and the final return) contribute to program behaviour (error handling, observable tracing, state changes and unlocking). Removing any of these executed operations could alter control flow, resource state (lock/unlock), observable output or timing, which may affect an embedded system's behaviour. The LFS_TRACE calls are not assumed to be removable (they may affect timing or diagnostics), and unreachable-code and initialization exceptions do not apply here.",
