  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_close code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/154.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_close as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_close:\n```c\nint lfs_file_close(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_close(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    err = lfs_file_close_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_close -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_close:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_file_close_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n#ifndef LFS_READONLY\n    int err = lfs_file_sync_(lfs, file);\n#else\n    int err = 0;\n#endif\n\n    // remove from list of mdirs\n    lfs_mlist_remove(lfs, (struct lfs_mlist*)file);\n\n    // clean up memory\n    if (!file->cfg->buffer) {\n        lfs_free(file->cache.buffer);\n    }\n\n    return err;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_close code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Although some macros expand to no-ops in the provided snippets (e.g. LFS_TRACE expands to nothing and LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are no-ops in this build), none of the executed operations in lfs_file_close are removable without changing program behaviour in general. The function performs a lock check, an assertion that the file is open, calls lfs_file_close_ (which performs sync, list removal and memory cleanup), and unlocks. Removing any of these executed operations (the lock/unlock pair in real configurations, the call to lfs_file_close_, the list removal, or the memory cleanup) would alter observable behaviour. Therefore Rule 2.2 (no dead code) is not violated.",
