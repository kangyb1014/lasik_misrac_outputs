  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_close violates the MISRA rule \u201cA function parameter should not be modified\u201d you must be able to see any code that could (directly or via macro expansion) assign to the parameter identifiers `lfs` or `file`. Explaination per symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): lfs_file_close calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). If LFS_LOCK is a macro it could expand to code that assigns to its arguments or to the surrounding identifiers (rare but possible via token-pasting or side-effects). Inspecting its definition shows whether the parameter variable `lfs` could be modified indirectly during expansion or evaluation.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): similar to LFS_LOCK \u2014 must verify its expansion/implementation does not assign to `lfs` or `file` (or use address-of those parameters in a way that modifies them).\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function): LFS_TRACE is invoked with (void*)lfs and (void*)file. If it is a macro its expansion might contain statements that could modify local parameters (for example by using the parameter names or addresses). Confirming its definition rules out such modifications.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT (macro or function): called with lfs_mlist_isopen(...). Macros implementing assertions sometimes evaluate or manipulate their argument expressions in ways that could cause side-effects. Its definition must be checked to ensure it does not assign to `lfs` or `file`.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration/definition): although this is called with (struct lfs_mlist*)file (a cast), you must confirm it is not a macro or inline function that, when called, could use the address of the caller's parameter or otherwise cause the caller's parameter variables to be modified. Also confirm it does not rely on any unusual calling convention that could modify the caller's parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_file_close_ (declaration/definition): even though this is a plain call with the two parameters, if lfs_file_close_ is actually a macro or inline function that expands into code referencing the identifiers `lfs` or `file` (or takes their addresses via macro tricks), it could modify the caller's parameters. Inspecting its definition ensures no such modifications happen.\n\n- type definitions: lfs_t, lfs_file_t, struct lfs_mlist (and the member type of cfg): you need the types to understand how expressions like lfs->cfg and the cast (struct lfs_mlist*)file are formed. Knowing the types enables checking whether any of the called macros/functions accept pointer-to-pointer or otherwise could be invoked with the address of the parameter (which would allow modification of the parameter variable). It also clarifies whether any member access could be implemented via macros that rebind the parameter name.\n\nIn short: inspect the definitions of all macros used in the function and the declarations/definitions of the callees and involved types. Those are the symbols necessary to prove that the pointer-typed parameters themselves are not assigned to or otherwise modified inside lfs_file_close (including via macro expansion)."
