  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_size code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/42.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_size as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_size:\n```c\nlfs_soff_t lfs_file_size(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_size(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_size_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_size -> %\"PRIu32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_size:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n...\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_size_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    (void)lfs;\n\n#ifndef LFS_READONLY\n    if (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) {\n        return lfs_max(file->pos, file->ctz.size);\n    }\n#endif\n\n    return file->ctz.size;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_size code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The calls to LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) are executed but, given the provided macro definitions (LFS_LOCK expands to '((void)cfg,0)' and LFS_UNLOCK to '((void)cfg)'), they have no observable effect. Removing these operations would not change program behaviour in the current build configuration, so they constitute dead code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.
