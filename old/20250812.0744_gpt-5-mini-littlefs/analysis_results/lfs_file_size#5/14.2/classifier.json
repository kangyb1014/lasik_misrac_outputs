  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_size code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/44.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_size as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_size:\n```c\nlfs_soff_t lfs_file_size(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_size(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_size_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_size -> %\"PRIu32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_size:\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_size_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    (void)lfs;\n\n#ifndef LFS_READONLY\n    if (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) {\n        return lfs_max(file->pos, file->ctz.size);\n    }\n#endif\n\n    return file->ctz.size;\n}\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n...\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n...\ntypedef struct lfs {\n    lfs_cache_t rcache;\n    lfs_cache_t pcache;\n\n    lfs_block_t root[2];\n    struct lfs_mlist {\n        struct lfs_mlist *next;\n        uint16_t id;\n        uint8_t type;\n        lfs_mdir_t m;\n    } *mlist;\n    uint32_t seed;\n\n    lfs_gstate_t gstate;\n    lfs_gstate_t gdisk;\n    lfs_gstate_t gdelta;\n\n    struct lfs_lookahead {\n        lfs_block_t start;\n        lfs_block_t size;\n        lfs_block_t next;\n        lfs_block_t ckpoint;\n        uint8_t *buffer;\n    } lookahead;\n\n    const struct lfs_config *cfg;\n    lfs_size_t block_count;\n    lfs_size_t name_max;\n    lfs_size_t file_max;\n    lfs_size_t attr_max;\n    lfs_size_t inline_max;\n\n#ifdef LFS_MIGRATE\n    struct lfs1 *lfs1;\n#endif\n} lfs_t\n...\ntypedef struct lfs_file {\n    struct lfs_file *next;\n    uint16_t id;\n    uint8_t type;\n    lfs_mdir_t m;\n\n    struct lfs_ctz {\n        lfs_block_t head;\n        lfs_size_t size;\n    } ctz;\n\n    uint32_t flags;\n    lfs_off_t pos;\n    lfs_block_t block;\n    lfs_off_t off;\n    lfs_cache_t cache;\n\n    const struct lfs_file_config *cfg;\n} lfs_file_t\n...\nstruct lfs_mlist {\n        struct lfs_mlist *next;\n        uint16_t id;\n        uint8_t type;\n        lfs_mdir_t m;\n    }\n...\ntypedef int32_t  lfs_soff_t\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_size code violates the rule 14.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The only for loop in the provided code is in lfs_mlist_isopen: for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next). This loop: (1) defines and initializes a single loop counter (p) in the first clause; (2) uses a second-clause condition (*p) that has no persistent side effects and only uses the loop counter; (3) uses a third-clause expression that modifies only the loop counter (p = &(*p)->next) and does not modify objects changed in the loop body; and (4) contains only one loop counter which is not modified by the loop body. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated.",
