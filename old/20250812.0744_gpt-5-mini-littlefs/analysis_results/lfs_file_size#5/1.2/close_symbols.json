  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: Macro (or function) used to acquire the lock. Its definition may use compiler extensions (inline assembler, builtin atomics, attributes, typeof, statement expressions, etc.). Must inspect to decide if an extension is used.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK for the unlock counterpart.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro/function used with format strings and variadic arguments. Its implementation may use variadic macros, compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__((format(...)))), __func__/__PRETTY_FUNCTION__, or other extensions. Need the definition to verify compliance.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro used here. The macro may expand to compiler-specific intrinsics, attributes, or use of extension diagnostics. Inspecting its definition is required.\n\n- PRIu32: Format macro used in the format string. Although defined by inttypes.h in standard C99, projects sometimes redefine or wrap it; need to confirm the exact macro in this code base to ensure no nonstandard redefinition or extension is used.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called function. While the call itself is standard, its implementation could use extensions (inline functions with GNU inline rules, typeof, statement expressions, GCC attributes). Provide its definition to check.\n\n- lfs_file_size_: Internal function called for actual computation. Its body may call other helpers or contain language extensions; include it for full analysis.\n\n- lfs_max: Called by lfs_file_size_ (from the call graph). Commonly implemented as a macro that may use typeof or statement expressions (GCC extensions). Must inspect its definition to ensure no extension is used.\n\n- lfs_soff_t: Return type of the function. Its typedef may use implementation-defined width or compiler-specific attributes; include to verify it's a standard typedef and not using extensions.\n\n- lfs_t: The filesystem context type. Its definition is needed because fields accessed (lfs->cfg, lfs->mlist) and their types might themselves use extensions (bitfields, packed/aligned attributes, anonymous structs/unions, etc.).\n\n- lfs_file_t: File handle type passed into the function. Its definition may be a typedef or macro that uses extensions (anonymous structs, compiler extensions). Include to check for extensions.\n\n- lfs_cfg: The configuration structure type stored in lfs->cfg (included because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK take lfs->cfg). The cfg type or its macros may use compiler extensions (packed attributes, unusual typedefs) that affect compliance.\n\nThese symbols are the points where nonstandard language features are most likely to be introduced (macros, inline helpers, attributes, builtins, or GCC/Clang-specific constructs). Inspecting their definitions is necessary to determine whether the target function (and the macros/functions it relies on) use compiler language extensions that would violate the MISRA requirement."
