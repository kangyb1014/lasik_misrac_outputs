  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_ctz_traverse code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/11.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_ctz_traverse as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_ctz_traverse:\n```c\nstatic int lfs_ctz_traverse(lfs_t *lfs,\n        const lfs_cache_t *pcache, lfs_cache_t *rcache,\n        lfs_block_t head, lfs_size_t size,\n        int (*cb)(void*, lfs_block_t), void *data) {\n    if (size == 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    lfs_off_t index = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &(lfs_off_t){size-1});\n\n    while (true) {\n        int err = cb(data, head);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n\n        if (index == 0) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        lfs_block_t heads[2];\n        int count = 2 - (index & 1);\n        err = lfs_bd_read(lfs,\n                pcache, rcache, count*sizeof(head),\n                head, 0, &heads, count*sizeof(head));\n        heads[0] = lfs_fromle32(heads[0]);\n        heads[1] = lfs_fromle32(heads[1]);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < count-1; i++) {\n            err = cb(data, heads[i]);\n            if (err) {\n                return err;\n            }\n        }\n\n        head = heads[count-1];\n        index -= count;\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_ctz_traverse code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: all pointer parameters are const-qualified where appropriate. pcache is declared const since it is only read; rcache and lfs are non-const because they are passed to helper functions that may modify the underlying objects (and thus cannot be const). The callback is declared to take void *data because the callback may legitimately modify the pointed object; making it const would be overly restrictive. No pointer in lfs_ctz_traverse could reasonably be made const without changing the behavior or the contracts of the called functions, so Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
