It is executed but has no observable effect; removing it would not change program behaviour in this configuration, which meets the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.

  "explanation": "Rule 2.2 forbids operations that are executed but whose removal would not change program behaviour (dead code). In the scenario described LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) is defined as ((void)cfg) in the provided build, which has no side-effects and produces no observable behaviour at runtime. That call is therefore an executed no-op: removing the statement would not change program behaviour in that configuration, which meets the definition of dead code. The agent\u2019s remark about the early if (err) return err; being unreachable (because LFS_LOCK always returns 0 in the given build) is correct but irrelevant to Rule 2.2 because unreachable code is explicitly distinguished from dead code in the rule notes. Caveats: if LFS_UNLOCK produced timing effects, performed volatile accesses, or the project\u2019s permitted configurations include builds where LFS_UNLOCK is non\u2011trivial (e.g. real locking enabled), then the call would not be dead for the project as a whole; in that case a project-level MISRA assessment must consider those configurations or document a deviation. Given the stated assumption (the provided build defines LFS_UNLOCK as ((void)cfg)), the agent A\u2019s report is correct."
