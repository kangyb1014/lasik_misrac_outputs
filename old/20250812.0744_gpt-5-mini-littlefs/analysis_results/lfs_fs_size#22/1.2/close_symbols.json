  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: this macro (or function) is invoked directly. Its definition may contain compiler extensions (e.g. GNU statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, __attribute__, inline asm, __extension__, builtin functions). We must inspect its expansion to decide if a language extension is used.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock implementation could use compiler-specific extensions; the macro body must be checked.  \n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro is variadic/complex and commonly implemented with macro tricks. Its definition could use GCC/clang extensions (statement-expressions, typeof, __attribute__, __builtin_*, token-pasting extensions). Inspecting the macro body is required.  \n- PRId32: the format macro comes from inttypes.h. Confirming its definition (string literal macro vs non-standard extension) ensures the format use \"%\"PRId32 is standard and not a compiler extension.  \n- lfs_ssize_t: the typedef/underlying integer type must be checked to ensure it is a standard typedef and not created using compiler-specific attributes or extensions.  \n- lfs_t (struct definition including cfg member): the struct/type of lfs (and specifically the cfg member) must be inspected because its declaration could contain extensions (bit-field sizes from expressions, attribute annotations, anonymous structs/unions under non-standard extensions, etc.) that would violate the rule.  \n- lfs_fs_size_ (declaration/definition): although only called, its prototype/definition might carry attributes or use non-standard parameter syntax/extension. We need to verify it to ensure no language extensions are involved in the call/return usage."
