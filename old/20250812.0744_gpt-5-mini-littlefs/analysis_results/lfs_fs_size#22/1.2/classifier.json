  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_fs_size code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/176.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_fs_size as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_fs_size:\n```c\nlfs_ssize_t lfs_fs_size(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_size(%p)\", (void*)lfs);\n\n    lfs_ssize_t res = lfs_fs_size_(lfs);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_size -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_fs_size:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\ntypedef int32_t  lfs_ssize_t\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_fs_size code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No compiler-specific language extensions are used in the provided lfs_fs_size implementation. The function uses standard C constructs: macro calls (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK), a standard cast (void*) in the trace, the PRId32 macro from <inttypes.h>, and a variadic macro token (__VA_ARGS__) which is a standard C99 feature. There are no compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, asm, typeof, __builtin_*, or other vendor-specific keywords. Therefore Rule 1.2 is not violated.",
