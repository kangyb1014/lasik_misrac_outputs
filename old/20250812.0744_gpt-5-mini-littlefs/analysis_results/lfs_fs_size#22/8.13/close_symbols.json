  "explanation": "- struct lfs_t (full definition): needed to know the exact type pointed to by the function parameter lfs_t *lfs (its members, whether members are pointers, and whether any members are themselves const-qualified). This lets you decide if lfs could be declared pointer-to-const or if its members are being modified.\n- type/typedef of lfs->cfg (cfg member type): lfs_fs_size calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg). To judge const-qualification you must know the cfg member's type (is it a pointer, is it const-qualified in the struct) and whether operations on it modify the object.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function declaration/definition): LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg. You must inspect its parameter types and body to determine whether it modifies the object passed (or requires a non-const pointer), which affects whether lfs (or its cfg member) can be const.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function declaration/definition): same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 unlock may modify the cfg/object; its signature/body determines const requirements.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function declaration/definition): although typically a logging helper, its implementation could access or modify data; include it to confirm it does not write through the lfs pointer (if it does, lfs cannot be const).\n- lfs_fs_size_ (prototype and full implementation): lfs_fs_size immediately calls this helper. If lfs_fs_size_ (directly or indirectly) modifies the object pointed to by lfs, then lfs should not be a pointer-to-const. You must inspect its signature and body to determine whether it mutates lfs or any subobjects.\n- lfs_fs_traverse_ (prototype and full implementation): shown in the static call graph as a callee of lfs_fs_size_. Any modifications to lfs could occur there; include it (and any other callees used by lfs_fs_size_) to see whether lfs is modified anywhere in the call chain.\n\nCollectively these symbols let you answer: does this function or any function it calls modify the object pointed to by the lfs pointer (or require a non-const pointer), and therefore whether the parameter could or should be changed to point-to-const under the MISRA rule."
