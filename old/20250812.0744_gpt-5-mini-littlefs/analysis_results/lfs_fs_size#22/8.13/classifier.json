  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_fs_size code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/179.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_fs_size as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_fs_size:\n```c\nlfs_ssize_t lfs_fs_size(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_size(%p)\", (void*)lfs);\n\n    lfs_ssize_t res = lfs_fs_size_(lfs);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_size -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_fs_size code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not a violation: lfs_fs_size takes a mutable lfs_t * because it performs operations that modify or depend on mutable state (calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) / LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) and forwards lfs to lfs_fs_size_). Since the function (or the macros it uses) can alter or rely on non-const members of *lfs, the pointer must not be const-qualified. Therefore Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
