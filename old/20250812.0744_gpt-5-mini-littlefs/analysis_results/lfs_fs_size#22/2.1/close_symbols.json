  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in lfs_fs_size are statically unreachable you must know whether any called macro/function never returns or always forces a particular control-flow outcome. Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The first statement assigns err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and immediately tests err. If LFS_LOCK can be non-returning (e.g. longjmp/abort/exit) or if its semantics guarantee err is always non-zero (or always zero), then either the rest of the function or the return branch could be unreachable. You need the implementation/signature and semantics of LFS_LOCK to determine reachable paths.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Appears later and is expected to execute on the normal return path. If LFS_UNLOCK is non-returning (or has control-flow effects such as longjmp/exit), this could make subsequent code unreachable or alter reachability reasoning. Include its definition.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function is invoked twice inside the function. Some trace macros expand to complex code (including conditionally compiled constructs or diagnostics that may include control-transfer or noreturn calls). You must confirm that LFS_TRACE is a simple/logging no-side-effect call (or empty) so it does not affect reachability.\n\n- lfs_fs_size_: The main callee that produces res. If lfs_fs_size_ never returns (infinite loop, abort, noreturn), then the statements after its call (second LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK, return res) would be unreachable. You must inspect lfs_fs_size_ implementation and its attributes.\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: lfs_fs_size_ calls lfs_fs_traverse_ (per the call graph). If that callee (or deeper callees) are non-returning, it will make lfs_fs_size_ non-returning and therefore the trailing statements in lfs_fs_size unreachable. Include lfs_fs_traverse_ (and any other deep callees discovered during analysis) to establish whether lfs_fs_size_ returns under all conditions.\n\n- typedef/definition of lfs_t (including its cfg member type): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg. The type and invariants of cfg may affect LFS_LOCK semantics (e.g. a configuration that causes lock to always fail or abort). Include the lfs_t definition to understand the argument passed to lock/unlock and any invariants that affect control flow.\n\n(Other typedefs like lfs_ssize_t or format macros do not affect control flow and are unnecessary for reachability analysis.)"
