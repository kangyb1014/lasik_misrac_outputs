  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_size_: The target calls this function directly. Any use of string.h functions (memcpy/memmove/memset/strlen/strcpy/etc.) that could produce out-of-bounds accesses might occur here, so its body must be inspected.\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: It is called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_fs_size_. String operations in this traversal routine (or functions it calls) are a likely location for buffer accesses; include it to follow the call chain.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro) and its underlying lock/unlock implementation: The macro may expand to code or function calls that operate on the cfg object or internal buffers (memset/memcpy) \u2014 include its definition/implementation to determine whether any string.h functions are used and whether they might access out of bounds.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro) and its underlying implementation: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 unlocking code could touch memory (including cleanup) and may call string functions.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro) and its underlying tracing/format implementation: Tracing/logging macros often format or copy strings (internally calling strlen/strcpy/memcpy or printf-like helpers). Include its expansion/implementation to check whether it can invoke <string.h> functions unsafely.\n- lfs_t (full struct definition): The layout and types of members (buffers, pointers, sizes, cfg pointer) are required to reason about buffer sizes and whether pointer parameters passed into string functions are valid.\n- type/definition of lfs->cfg (the filesystem configuration struct): The cfg structure typically contains buffer pointers, size fields and function pointers used by lock/trace/FS routines; its fields are needed to determine actual object bounds and validate any string.h usages.\n\nInclude the implementations (source) of the above symbols in the next analysis step so the presence and arguments of any string.h calls can be checked for potential out-of-bounds access."
