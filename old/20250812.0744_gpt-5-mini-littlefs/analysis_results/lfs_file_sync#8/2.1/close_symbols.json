  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in lfs_file_sync are unreachable you must know whether any of the called macros/functions can transfer control in a way that prevents subsequent statements from executing. Specifically:\n- LFS_LOCK: the function starts with err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg); an early non-zero return depends on LFS_LOCK semantics (does it ever longjmp/abort instead of returning, or always return an int?).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: called at the end; its implementation might alter control flow (e.g. abort/longjmp) so must be checked for non-return behavior.\n- LFS_ASSERT: wraps the lfs_mlist_isopen call; assertion macros sometimes abort or longjmp on failure \u2014 this affects reachability of the remainder of the function.\n- LFS_TRACE: tracing macros could implement handlers that do not return (rare but possible); need to confirm they do not make later code unreachable.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: used inside the assertion; if it never returns or has side effects that alter control flow, the code after the assertion could be unreachable.\n- lfs_file_sync_: the main work is delegated here; if this function never returns (e.g. infinite loop, abort, longjmp) then the following LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK and return are unreachable.\n- lfs_file_flush, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_bd_sync, lfs_ctz_tole32, lfs_dir_commit: these are the callees of lfs_file_sync_. To determine whether lfs_file_sync_ always returns, you must inspect these callees for any non-returning behavior (abort/longjmp/infinite loop) or other control-flow effects that would make code after the lfs_file_sync_ call unreachable.\n\nIncluding these symbols (the macros and the transitive callees of lfs_file_sync_) gives the necessary control-flow information to determine whether any portion of lfs_file_sync is provably unreachable (and thus would violate the MISRA rule)."
