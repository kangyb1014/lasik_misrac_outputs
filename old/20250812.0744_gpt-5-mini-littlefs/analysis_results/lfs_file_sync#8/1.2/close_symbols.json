  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to check for language-extension usage:\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are macros (or inline functions) called directly in the target. Their definitions must be inspected to see if they expand to compiler extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, inline asm, __attribute__ uses, non-standard builtins, or other vendor-specific extensions) rather than standard C constructs.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is invoked with format strings and casts. Logging macros commonly use variadic macros, GNU extensions, statement-expressions, or attributes (e.g. __attribute__((format))) \u2014 all potential compiler extensions. The macro body must be examined to determine whether any non-standard language feature is used.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macros often use do { ... } while (0) or may expand to compiler-specific intrinsics/attributes (e.g. __builtin_trap, __attribute__((noreturn))). Its definition is needed to confirm only standard-C constructs are used.\n\n- lfs_t and lfs_file_t: The types of the parameters must be available (typedef/struct definitions). Their definitions may contain compiler-specific extensions (bit-field widths with implementation-defined behavior, attribute annotations, anonymous structs/unions that are extensions in some compilers, or other non-standard declarations) that would violate the rule if used.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: The code casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*). The struct definition must be checked for any extensions (anonymous members, packed/packed attribute, compiler-specific alignment, bitfields, or other non-standard features).\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Although present in the call graph, its declaration/definition should be checked for extensions on its prototype (e.g. implementation-specific attributes, inline assembly, nonstandard linkage, variadic use) because the call expression or its prototype could use extensions that affect the target function.\n\n- lfs_file_sync_: The called helper\u2019s declaration/definition should be inspected because the target forwards to it; its signature or inlining/macro form could use language extensions (inline semantics, attributes, macros that expand with extensions) that should be attributed to the call site analysis.\n\n- configuration object type of lfs->cfg (definition): The LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK macros likely accept the lfs->cfg object. The concrete type and its definition (struct/typedef) must be checked for non-standard features (attributes, compiler-specific pragmas, anonymous members, bitfields, etc.) used in the configuration type or in lock/unlock macros.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the target uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the macro definitions and the involved type and function declarations/definitions, since the function body itself primarily invokes macros and uses casts \u2014 those macros/types are the likely place where extensions would appear."
