  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is used as LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). LFS_LOCK may be a macro or function; if it is a macro it could expand to code that assigns to or otherwise modifies the expression passed in (or even performs a return). To prove the target function does not modify its parameter pointer variables, we must inspect the LFS_LOCK definition/expansion.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK. The macro/function definition could contain side effects that assign to expressions involving the parameter lfs (or use control-flow altering constructs). Its expansion must be checked to ensure no assignment to the parameter variables occurs.\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function is invoked with (void*)lfs and (void*)dir. Macros in particular can contain unexpected assignments or side effects that could modify the parameter variables. The definition is needed to verify it does not modify the pointer parameters.\n- lfs_dir_tell_: Although it is a normal callee (and cannot change the caller\u2019s pointer variable itself), include its prototype/definition to confirm it is not a macro/inline that could expand into code modifying the caller\u2019s parameters; and to confirm there is no unusual passing-by-reference macro trick that would allow the callee to modify the caller\u2019s parameter variable.\n- struct/typedef lfs_t (definition, including member cfg): The code uses lfs->cfg. Knowing lfs_t\u2019s definition (and the type of cfg) lets you verify that lfs is indeed a pointer parameter (not a macro or special type) and to inspect whether cfg is a macro/union/volatile that could cause macros to perform assignments to lfs itself. It also helps detect any hidden macro tricks tied to the type.\n- struct/typedef lfs_dir_t (definition): To confirm dir is a pointer parameter type (and not a macro) and to ensure there are no type-level macros or qualifiers that change how dir is used (e.g., if dir is defined via macro to expand into an lvalue that could be reassigned by other macros).\n- typedef lfs_soff_t: The return type is used when returning err; include this typedef to check for implicit conversions that might hide macro expansions or casts that modify parameters (primarily for completeness of type context)."
