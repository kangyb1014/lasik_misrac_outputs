  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_unmount code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/163.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_unmount as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_unmount:\n```c\nint lfs_unmount(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_unmount(%p)\", (void*)lfs);\n\n    err = lfs_unmount_(lfs);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_unmount -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_unmount:\nstatic int lfs_unmount_(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    return lfs_deinit(lfs);\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_deinit(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    // free allocated memory\n    if (!lfs->cfg->read_buffer) {\n        lfs_free(lfs->rcache.buffer);\n    }\n\n    if (!lfs->cfg->prog_buffer) {\n        lfs_free(lfs->pcache.buffer);\n    }\n\n    if (!lfs->cfg->lookahead_buffer) {\n        lfs_free(lfs->lookahead.buffer);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_unmount code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The parameter lfs_t *lfs is passed to lfs_unmount_, which calls lfs_deinit. lfs_deinit frees internal buffers (e.g. lfs_free(lfs->rcache.buffer); lfs_free(lfs->pcache.buffer); lfs_free(lfs->lookahead.buffer);) and therefore modifies the object pointed to by lfs. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer should NOT be const-qualified when the function modifies the pointed-to object. Because lfs_unmount (via lfs_unmount_ / lfs_deinit) modifies lfs, it is correct that the pointer is non-const; hence the rule is not violated.",
