  "explanation": "- lfs_unmount_: need the prototype and body to see whether it accepts a const lfs_t* or a non-const lfs_t* and to determine if it (or any callees it directly invokes) modifies the object pointed to by the lfs parameter. If it modifies lfs, lfs_unmount must not take a const pointer.  \n- lfs_deinit: lfs_unmount_ calls lfs_deinit; we need its prototype/body to determine whether it modifies lfs or any objects reachable from lfs (which would force non-const pointers) or whether it only reads state (allowing const).  \n- struct lfs_t (full definition): to know whether the lfs parameter itself or any of its members are declared with const qualifiers. Also to find the exact member name/type of cfg and other members that may be passed to callees.  \n- type of lfs_t::cfg (typedef/struct for cfg): lfs_unmount calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg). We must know the cfg type and whether it is a pointer type and whether it is declared const-qualified in lfs_t. This determines whether passing lfs->cfg to lock/unlock violates pointer constness rules.  \n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function definition/prototype): to see the parameter type (const-qualified or not) and whether the lock implementation modifies the object pointed to by cfg. If LFS_LOCK expects a non-const pointer or modifies cfg, cfg must not be const.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definition/prototype): same reasons as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its parameter constness and whether it modifies the pointed object affect whether cfg (and transitive pointers) may be const.  \n- LFS_TRACE (macro/function definition): although tracing typically does not modify lfs, lfs is cast to (void*) in the call; we need the macro definition to verify whether that cast discards const qualification or causes modification or casts away const in a way that violates MISRA guidelines.\n\nCollecting these symbols (prototypes and bodies where available) lets the next analyzer determine whether any pointer parameters should be const-qualified (or must be non-const because callees modify the pointed objects) and whether any casts/macros discard constness in violation of the MISRA rule."
