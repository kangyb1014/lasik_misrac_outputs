  "explanation": "- lfs_unmount_: direct callee of lfs_unmount; must be inspected to see whether it always returns or can perform non\u2011local control transfers (exit/longjmp/abort/infinite loop). If it never returns then the subsequent TRACE/UNLOCK/return in lfs_unmount would be unreachable.  \n- lfs_deinit: callee of lfs_unmount_; its control\u2011flow (particularly non\u2011returning behavior) can make lfs_unmount_ non\u2011returning, so it must be examined transitively.  \n- LFS_LOCK: called at the start and its result controls the early return. Need to confirm it cannot itself perform non\u2011local control transfers (abort/longjmp/exit) or contain constructs that make parts of lfs_unmount unreachable.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: called near the end; must be checked for non\u2011local exits or infinite loops that would make the following return unreachable.  \n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro/function invoked before and after lfs_unmount_ \u2014 it must be verified it does not contain non\u2011returning behavior (assert/exit) that could render later statements unreachable.\n\nThese symbols are required because unreachable\u2011code analysis of lfs_unmount depends on whether any called function or macro can prevent normal control flow (non\u2011returning calls, longjmp/exit, infinite loops, or embedded returns), including transitive callees."
