  "explanation": "The build error was caused by LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK being macros in some configurations, which made the extern declarations syntactically invalid. I added #undef LFS_LOCK and #undef LFS_UNLOCK before declaring them as extern functions to prevent macro expansion. I also added the necessary includes (stdio.h and stdarg.h), a forward declaration for struct lfs_config, a typedef for lfs_t, and an extern declaration for lfs_unmount_ so the file compiles standalone. No macros were defined, no main was added, and the original lfs_unmount logic was preserved."
