  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_unmount violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings we must inspect any code it executes (including macros).  - lfs_unmount_: Direct callee of lfs_unmount; its body may call memcmp on strings.  - lfs_deinit: Called by lfs_unmount_ per the static call graph; must be inspected for memcmp usage.  - LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: Used in lfs_unmount; these are macros or functions that may expand/call into code that uses memcmp (or call other functions that do).  - LFS_TRACE: Logging macro/function used in lfs_unmount; its expansion could call helper routines that use memcmp or perform string comparisons.  - lfs_t: The filesystem object type used in the function; its definition can reveal inline functions, embedded helpers, or macro expansions that perform string comparisons.  - type_of(lfs->cfg): The configuration/lock object type referenced by LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; the implementation of the lock API tied to this type may contain string comparisons (or call routines that do).  Inspecting these symbols (definitions/expansions and their callees) is sufficient to see whether any executed code uses memcmp on null-terminated strings."
