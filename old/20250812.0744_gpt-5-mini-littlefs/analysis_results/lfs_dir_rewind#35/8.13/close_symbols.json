  "explanation": "- lfs_t (struct definition): needed to know the exact type and mutable fields (notably the cfg field) so we can determine whether making the lfs parameter a pointer-to-const is possible or whether members are written to by this function or its callees.\n- lfs_dir_t (struct definition): required to see what state is stored in the directory object and whether the directory is modified (so whether dir should remain non-const).\n- lfs_dir_rewind_ (prototype and implementation): this function is directly called with (lfs, dir); we must inspect its signature for const-qualifiers and its body to see whether it modifies either object. If it writes into *lfs or *dir, the public wrapper cannot make the pointers const.\n- lfs_dir_fetch (prototype and implementation): lfs_dir_rewind_ calls this function; any modification performed here to lfs or dir (or transitive callees) prevents promoting the parameters to const. We need its signature and body.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro) and its underlying lock function(s): LFS_LOCK is called with lfs->cfg. If the lock API requires a non-const cfg pointer (or modifies cfg), that prevents making lfs (or its cfg member) const. We need the macro and the target lock function prototype to check const usage.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro) and its underlying unlock function(s): same reason as LFS_LOCK; the unlock API may require non-const parameters or modify cfg.\n- type of lfs->cfg (e.g. struct lfs_config or typedef): even if lfs_t is inspected, explicitly knowing the cfg type and its API constness is necessary to decide whether lfs (or cfg pointer) can be const-qualified.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): the wrapper calls LFS_TRACE with explicit (void*) casts of lfs and dir. If we consider changing parameters to const pointers, these casts may discard qualifiers (casting const pointer to void*), which itself can violate MISRA rules. We must inspect the trace macro to see whether it accepts const void* or whether the existing casts would illegally drop const.\n\nProvide these symbols (prototypes/definitions and implementations where applicable) to the next agent so it can determine whether the lfs and dir pointer parameters can be const-qualified without violating MISRA C pointer-to-const rules."
