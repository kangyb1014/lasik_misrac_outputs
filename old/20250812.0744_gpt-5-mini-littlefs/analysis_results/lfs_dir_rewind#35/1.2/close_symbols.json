  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked as a macro/function and may expand to compiler-specific constructs (statement-expressions, typeof, inline asm, __attribute__, GCC-style variadic-macro tricks like ##__VA_ARGS__, etc.). You must inspect its definition to decide whether any language extensions are used.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2013 its expansion/implementation may contain compiler extensions that would make the target function use an extension.\n- LFS_TRACE: Almost certainly a macro (variadic or wrapping printf-like functionality). Its definition must be checked for use of extensions (variadic-macro extensions, GCC token-pasting/##__VA_ARGS__, statement-expressions, attributes, inline asm, or non\u2011standard format macros).\n- lfs_t (definition): The function dereferences lfs->cfg. The lfs_t definition (and the type of its cfg member) must be inspected for use of language-extension features (anonymous structs/unions, compiler-specific attributes on members, bit-field extensions, packed/aligned attributes, flexible/zero-length arrays that are non-standard, etc.) that would make the target function rely on extensions.\n- lfs_dir_t (definition): The function takes a pointer to this type and casts it for tracing; its definition could include extension constructs (anonymous unions/structs, attributes) that affect whether the function uses language extensions.\n- lfs_dir_rewind_ (declaration/definition): The call-site can be affected by the visible declaration (e.g. GCC __attribute__ on the prototype, inline or asm decorations). Inspecting its declaration/definition is required to ensure no compiler-specific attributes or extensions are introduced into the target function's translation unit.\n\nOnly these symbols are needed to determine whether the target function itself (including what its macros expand to and the types it uses) employs any compiler language extensions."
