  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_seek (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings we need to inspect any callees that might call memcmp and the types/objects passed into those calls. Explanations per symbol:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called directly by lfs_file_seek. Inspect its body to see if it uses memcmp (or forwards string/buffer pointers to other functions that do). If it calls memcmp with char* arguments, that could be a rule violation.\n\n- lfs_file_seek_: The core work is delegated here. We must inspect it for any memcmp usage and for the provenance of arguments passed to memcmp (are they null\u2011terminated strings?).\n\n- lfs_file_size_: The static call graph shows lfs_file_seek_ calls this. Include it because memcmp might be used deeper in this chain or it may return/produce buffers/strings passed up into memcmp calls.\n\n- lfs_ctz_index: Called by lfs_file_seek_. Include because it might perform comparisons using memcmp or produce data that is compared with memcmp higher up.\n\n- lfs_file_flush: Called by lfs_file_seek_. Include for the same reason \u2014 memcmp could be used there or its buffers might be compared elsewhere.\n\n- memcmp: The actual Standard Library function that the MISRA rule targets. We need to find every call site (direct or in callees above) to memcmp to inspect the types/semantics of its arguments and determine whether it is being used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t, struct lfs_mlist: Type/structure definitions used by the above functions. Knowing the definitions and field types is necessary to determine whether pointers/arrays passed into memcmp are string buffers (null\u2011terminated) or raw binary buffers; this affects whether the memcmp usage violates the rule.\n\nCollecting the source/definitions for these symbols allows a complete inspection of all call sites reachable from lfs_file_seek that could invoke memcmp or pass string pointers into it."
