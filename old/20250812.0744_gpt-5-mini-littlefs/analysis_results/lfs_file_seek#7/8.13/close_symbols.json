  "explanation": "- lfs_file_seek_: need the prototype/definition to see whether this callee modifies the objects pointed to by the passed lfs and/or file pointers (e.g. advances file position, updates file metadata). If it writes through those pointers then the corresponding parameters in lfs_file_seek must be non-const.\\n- lfs_file_t: need the typedef/struct layout to know the concrete type that 'file' points to (fields that may be modified) and to determine whether it is effectively the same as struct lfs_mlist; this determines whether the parameter could be const.\\n- struct lfs_mlist: need the declaration to compare with lfs_file_t (the code casts file to this type) and to inspect whether functions that take a lfs_mlist* promise not to modify the object (const-qualified parameter) or do modify it.\\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: need the prototype/definition to see whether it takes a const struct lfs_mlist* or a non-const pointer and whether it modifies the object. The cast in the call is relevant to const-correctness analysis.\\n- lfs_t: need the typedef/struct layout to see what fields (cfg, mlist) are and whether lfs is modified by any callees; this bears on whether lfs parameter could be const.\\n- type of lfs->cfg (the cfg field typedef): LFS_LOCK is called with lfs->cfg; we must know the cfg type to check how LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are declared and whether they modify the cfg (which would force lfs to be non-const).\\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macros or functions): need their declarations/definitions to determine whether they modify the object pointed to by lfs->cfg or otherwise write through lfs; if they perform writes then lfs cannot be a pointer-to-const.\\nThese symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether any object reachable through the pointer parameters (lfs, file) is modified by the target function or its immediate callees; that information is necessary to decide whether the pointer parameter types should (or must not) be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
