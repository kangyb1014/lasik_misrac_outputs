  "explanation": "You must inspect the following symbols to determine whether any of the function parameters (lfs, file, off, whence) are modified in lfs_file_seek, because MISRA forbids modifying the parameter objects themselves (the pointer variables or scalar parameters). Brief reasons for each:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: macro or function called at the top. Macros can expand into code that assigns to the token passed (e.g. could contain \"(arg) = ...\"). You need its definition to confirm it doesn't assign to the local parameter variable lfs (or otherwise modify any parameter identifier).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reasoning as LFS_LOCK for potential macro expansion side-effects on the lfs expression or parameter variables.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro that receives lfs, file, off, whence. Macro expansion could contain assignments to its arguments (e.g. symmetrically named tokens). Inspect the macro to ensure it does not assign to any of the parameter identifiers.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro taking an expression that references file/lfs. As a macro it might expand to code that reuses the argument token names; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not assign to parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called with lfs->mlist and (struct lfs_mlist*)file. You need its prototype and implementation to verify it does not take the address of the caller's parameter variables (e.g. via a pointer-to-pointer) or otherwise produce side-effects that would modify the parameter variables themselves. Even though it is passed by value here, the implementation could be a macro or wrapper that does unusual operations.\n\n- lfs_file_seek_: the core worker called with (lfs, file, off, whence). You must inspect its prototype/definition to confirm it does not expect addresses of the caller's local parameter variables (for example if the call actually passes &off in some wrapper) and that control flow or macros inside it do not modify the caller's parameter variables via macro abuse. Also check whether it is a macro that could expand into assignments using the tokens 'lfs', 'file', 'off', or 'whence'.\n\n- struct lfs_t (definition / typedef): needed to see whether 'lfs' is an ordinary pointer variable, or if the type or macros around it could make 'lfs' behave unusually (e.g. if lfs_t is a macro or contains unusual operator overloads in C wrappers). Also to inspect members (like cfg) accessed by LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK for possible side effects on parameter expressions.\n\n- lfs_file_t (typedef / definition): required to check whether 'file' is a plain pointer type or is implemented as a macro/opaque type that could cause unexpected macro expansions or aliasing that could lead to assignments to the parameter variable.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition): because the code casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*) and passes it to lfs_mlist_isopen; you need the type to understand how the cast is used and to confirm no address-of-parameter is being taken indirectly.\n\nIn short: inspect all macro definitions and called-function implementations/prototypes and the relevant type definitions. Macros are the highest risk for inadvertent modification of the parameter variables because their expansions can contain assignments to the tokens used as arguments."
