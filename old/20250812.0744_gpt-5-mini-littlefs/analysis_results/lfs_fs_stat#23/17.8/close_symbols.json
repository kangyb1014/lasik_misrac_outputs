  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_fs_stat modifies its parameter variables (violating MISRA: a function parameter shall not be modified) we must inspect any code that is expanded/instantiated inside this function and any textually/inline-expanded callees. Concretely:\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function): This is invoked with the expression lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK is a macro it could expand to code that assigns to tokens that include the passed expression; a malicious expansion could modify the parameter variable (or its subobjects) textually. We need the definition to be sure the parameter identifier lfs (or the local parameter variable) is not being overwritten by the macro expansion.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function): Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK; it is invoked inside this function and its expansion/definition must be checked for any assignment to the parameter identifiers lfs or fsinfo.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function): Appears twice and is almost certainly a macro. Macros can contain arbitrary code and could (in poorly written code) assign to parameter names or otherwise modify the parameter variables. We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not modify the pointer parameters.\n\n- lfs_fs_stat_ (function body or macro definition): The call is textually present in this function. If lfs_fs_stat_ is actually a macro or inline function-like macro it could expand in-place and modify the parameter variables; even if it is a normal function, confirm its declaration/definition to rule out a macro/inline expansion that changes the caller's parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_t (typedef/struct definition): We need the type definition of lfs_t so we can understand what lfs->cfg refers to and to check whether any macro expansions or member accesses could be interpreted as assignments to the parameter variable (for example, complicated macros that take the entire 'lfs' token). Knowing the structure also helps confirm that any writes affect members (allowed) vs the pointer variable itself (disallowed).\n\n- struct lfs_fsinfo (definition): Similarly, inspect the fsinfo type to know whether any code could be reinterpreting the fsinfo token in a way that would reassign the parameter variable rather than the object it points to.\n\n- lfs->cfg member declaration/type: Because LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg, we must be able to tell whether any assignments in those macros/functions would be to the cfg subobject (permitted) or could somehow be to the lfs parameter itself (not permitted). Knowing cfg's declaration helps disambiguate.\n\nIn short: check all macros/functions that are expanded/called inside lfs_fs_stat, plus the definitions of the parameter types and the cfg member, to be confident no textual expansion or side-effect assigns to the parameter identifiers lfs or fsinfo themselves."
