  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide if lfs_fs_stat contains unreachable code:\n\n- lfs_fs_stat_: The target calls this function and returns its result. To know whether code after the call (LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_stat -> %d\", err); LFS_UNLOCK(...); return err;) is reachable, you must inspect lfs_fs_stat_ for non-local exits (e.g. calls to exit/longjmp), infinite loops, or other control-flow constructs that would prevent return to the caller.\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked at the start and its return value determines whether the function immediately returns. You must inspect its definition/behavior to know if it can block, never return, longjmp, abort the program, or always return a specific value \u2014 all of which affect reachability of subsequent statements.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: This is executed near function end; you must inspect its definition to ensure it does not alter control flow (e.g. by longjmp/abort) and to verify whether it is always reached on normal returns (important when reasoning about unreachable code or missing cleanup).\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Although typically logging, this macro could conceivably contain control-flow affecting constructs (such as returns or asserts that abort). Its expansion should be checked to ensure it does not make code unreachable.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition, including the cfg member): The LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK macros take lfs->cfg. The type of cfg and any associated lock/unlock implementations or side-effects may be defined in the cfg/type. You need the type to follow the locking API used by LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and confirm whether locks can cause non-local control flow.\n\n- lfs_gstate_needssuperblock, lfs_fs_disk_version, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_superblock_fromle32: These are the callees of lfs_fs_stat_. If lfs_fs_stat_ delegates control to any of these (directly or indirectly) in ways that prevent returning (e.g. they call exit/longjmp or loop forever), that will make code in the caller unreachable. To be sure, inspect these symbols or the body of lfs_fs_stat_ if it uses them.\n\nIn short: inspect the locking/trace macros and the implementation of lfs_fs_stat_ (and its callees as necessary) to determine whether any statements in the target function are never reachable."
