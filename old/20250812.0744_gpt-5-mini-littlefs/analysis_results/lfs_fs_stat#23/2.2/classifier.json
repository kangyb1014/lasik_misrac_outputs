  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_fs_stat code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/186.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_fs_stat as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_fs_stat:\n```c\nint lfs_fs_stat(lfs_t *lfs, struct lfs_fsinfo *fsinfo) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_stat(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)fsinfo);\n\n    err = lfs_fs_stat_(lfs, fsinfo);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_stat -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_fs_stat:\nstatic inline bool lfs_gstate_needssuperblock(const lfs_gstate_t *a) {\n    return lfs_tag_size(a->tag) >> 9;\n}\n...\nstatic uint32_t lfs_fs_disk_version(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    (void)lfs;\n#ifdef LFS_MULTIVERSION\n    if (lfs->cfg->disk_version) {\n        return lfs->cfg->disk_version;\n    } else\n#endif\n    {\n        return LFS_DISK_VERSION;\n    }\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_dir_fetch(lfs_t *lfs,\n        lfs_mdir_t *dir, const lfs_block_t pair[2]) {\n    // note, mask=-1, tag=-1 can never match a tag since this\n    // pattern has the invalid bit set\n    return (int)lfs_dir_fetchmatch(lfs, dir, pair,\n            (lfs_tag_t)-1, (lfs_tag_t)-1, NULL, NULL, NULL);\n}\n...\nstatic lfs_stag_t lfs_dir_get(lfs_t *lfs, const lfs_mdir_t *dir,\n        lfs_tag_t gmask, lfs_tag_t gtag, void *buffer) {\n    return lfs_dir_getslice(lfs, dir,\n            gmask, gtag,\n            0, buffer, lfs_tag_size(gtag));\n}\n...\nstatic inline void lfs_superblock_fromle32(lfs_superblock_t *superblock) {\n    superblock->version     = lfs_fromle32(superblock->version);\n    superblock->block_size  = lfs_fromle32(superblock->block_size);\n    superblock->block_count = lfs_fromle32(superblock->block_count);\n    superblock->name_max    = lfs_fromle32(superblock->name_max);\n    superblock->file_max    = lfs_fromle32(superblock->file_max);\n    superblock->attr_max    = lfs_fromle32(superblock->attr_max);\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_fs_stat code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function contains no dead code: every executed operation can affect program behaviour. The initial lock and its error check perform a meaningful control-flow decision (early return on lock failure). The call to lfs_fs_stat_ is used to compute the return value, and the final unlock and return propagate that result. The LFS_TRACE calls might be no-ops in some builds, but that is a build-time configuration detail and cannot be assumed here; in any case their presence does not constitute dead code because they may affect observable behaviour (logging, timing). There is no unreachable code and no operations whose removal would be guaranteed to leave program behaviour unchanged.",
