  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked with lfs->cfg. If it is a macro it could expand into code that assigns to the function parameter variable (for example reassigning lfs or an argument). We must see its definition/expansion to verify it does not modify any of the parameters (lfs, file, buffer, size).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock primitive may be a macro or inline that could (maliciously or accidentally) modify a parameter; its definition is needed to confirm it does not assign to the parameter variables.\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is passed the parameters (casted) and may expand to complex code. If it is a macro it could evaluate/modify its macro arguments; we need its expansion to ensure it does not write to any parameter variables.\n- LFS_ASSERT: The assert macro evaluates lfs_mlist_isopen(...). If LFS_ASSERT is a macro (likely) its expansion might modify parameters (or wrap the argument in code that does). Its definition is needed to confirm no parameter assignment occurs.\n- lfs_t (definition): The code accesses lfs->cfg and lfs->mlist. The concrete struct/type definition is required to inspect how the above macros access fields and to confirm that no macro or inline function unexpectedly rebinds the lfs parameter itself.\n- lfs_file_write_ (definition/implementation): Although calls to other functions do not count as the target function modifying its own formal parameters, lfs_file_write_ might be a macro/inline expansion rather than a separate call. If it is an inline/macro expansion it could contain assignments to the parameter variables; therefore the implementation/definition must be checked.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration/definition): It is used as argument to LFS_ASSERT and could be a macro instead of a function. If it is a macro/inline that expands in-place, it could modify parameter variables; include its definition to verify it does not alter any formal parameter.\n\nIn short: include definitions/expansions of all macros used in this function and the concrete type for lfs, plus any callee that might actually be a macro/inline (lfs_file_write_, lfs_mlist_isopen). These are the symbols that can cause the target function to violate the MISRA rule by modifying a formal parameter via macro or inlined code."
