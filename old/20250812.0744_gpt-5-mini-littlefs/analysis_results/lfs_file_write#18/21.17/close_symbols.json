  "explanation": "Reason each symbol is required to check MISRA string.h bounds rule for lfs_file_write:\n\n- lfs_file_write_: The target function forwards all work to this helper. Any use of memcpy/memmove/memset/str* that could access 'buffer' or other memory will be inside this function. You must inspect its implementation to see whether string.h functions are called and what pointer/length arguments are passed.\n\n- lfs_file_flush: Called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_file_write_. It may move data between file caches, blocks, or the caller buffer using string.h functions. Its code and how it computes lengths/offsets are necessary to verify bounds.\n\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: Another callee of lfs_file_write_. It is a likely place for buffered writes and memcpy/memmove use; its buffer/length handling must be reviewed.\n\n- lfs_file_t (definition): The on-disk/in-memory file structure contains fields (file position, size, cache pointers/buffers) that are commonly used as destinations/sources and length operands in string.h calls. You need the structure layout and semantics to determine whether any memcpy/memmove uses stay inside object bounds.\n\n- lfs_t (definition): The filesystem state object (lfs) holds global buffers, caches or configuration pointers referenced by write routines. Its fields can affect buffer/length computations (e.g. cache buffers, block sizes) and are needed to judge bounds safety.\n\n- struct lfs_config (lfs->cfg) (definition): Configuration parameters (block size, read/write/cache buffer sizes, etc.) influence maximum copy sizes and alignment. These values are required to decide whether any string.h call might exceed object bounds.\n\n- lfs_size_t (typedef) and lfs_ssize_t (typedef): Understanding the exact integer types and ranges used for 'size' and return values is necessary to reason about integer overflow, signed/unsigned conversions, and whether size arguments to string.h functions can exceed object sizes.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Used in the assertion in lfs_file_write to validate that 'file' is open. You must inspect this (or at least its contract) to know what guarantees are provided about the 'file' pointer and its internal buffers (e.g. that cache pointers are valid), which affects whether subsequent string.h operations are safe.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: The assertion may be compiled out in non-debug builds. Knowing its behavior (macro/implementation) is important to determine whether the precondition that prevents invalid accesses is enforced at runtime; if it is only a debug-time check, the write path must still be safe without it.\n\nNote: lfs_file_write itself contains no string.h calls, so the critical places to inspect are lfs_file_write_ and its callees and the concrete definitions of the file/filesystem structures and size types to verify that any memcpy/memmove/memset/etc. arguments cannot result in out-of-bounds accesses. If lfs_file_write_ (or its callees) call further helpers that perform copies, those helpers and any block-device or cache functions they call (e.g. low-level bd_read/bd_prog helpers) should also be included in the analysis if present."
