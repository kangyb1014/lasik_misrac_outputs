  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if lfs_file_read modifies its parameters:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked with the expression lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK is a macro (or inline function) its expansion could contain assignments that modify the local parameter variable names (e.g. lfs) or otherwise have side effects on the parameter tokens. We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not assign to the function parameters (for MISRA rule compliance).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK; its expansion could modify parameter variables or use them as lvalues. Verify it does not assign to lfs, file, buffer, or size.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: A variadic/logging macro can be defined to evaluate or modify its arguments (via side-effecting macros). Check the definition to ensure it does not perform assignments to the parameter identifiers used in the call.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macros sometimes expand to code that can alter program state (e.g. abort handlers) or even do assignments in nonstandard builds. Confirm it does not modify any of the function parameters when expanded (especially the 'file' argument passed through a cast).\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Although a normal function call cannot change the caller's parameter variables, lfs_mlist_isopen could be a macro or inline that might expand in-place and modify identifiers. Also check its prototype to ensure the cast to (struct lfs_mlist*)file is safe and does not indicate any intention to rebind the pointer parameter in this scope.\n\n- lfs_file_read_: The call to this helper must be checked to ensure it is indeed a function (not a macro) and that no macro-expansion or inlined code modifies the caller's parameter identifiers. Confirm the call is ordinary and that lfs_file_read itself does not get rewritten by a macro.\n\n- lfs_t (definition): The type of the first parameter is needed to inspect member access (lfs->cfg, lfs->mlist). Some macros might rely on specific struct-layout assumptions or could operate on these members in a way that appears to modify the parameter token; knowing the structure helps determine allowed object modifications versus illegal pointer assignments.\n\n- lfs_file_t (definition): The type of the second parameter and how it relates to struct lfs_mlist (it is cast to struct lfs_mlist* in the assert) must be known to confirm that only the pointed-to object is being accessed and not that the file parameter itself is being reassigned.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition): Because file is explicitly cast to (struct lfs_mlist*), inspect this struct to ensure no macro or inline expects to rewrite the file identifier or to detect any macros that might rebind the parameter name.\n\n- lfs->cfg type/definition: The cfg member's type (often a cfg pointer/struct) is passed into LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK; its definition and the macros that operate on it are needed to ensure only the object referred to by lfs (its members) are modified and that the pointer parameter lfs itself is not assigned to.\n\nIn short: focus on any macros or in-place expansions (LFS_* macros and any symbol that might be a macro rather than a plain function/type). These are the only places where the source text of lfs_file_read could, via expansion, contain assignments to the function parameter identifiers and therefore violate the MISRA rule."
