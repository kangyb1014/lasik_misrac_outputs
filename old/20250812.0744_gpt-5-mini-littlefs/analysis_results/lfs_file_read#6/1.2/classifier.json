  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_read code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/48.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_read as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_read:\n```c\nlfs_ssize_t lfs_file_read(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_read(%p, %p, %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, buffer, size);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_ssize_t res = lfs_file_read_(lfs, file, buffer, size);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_read -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_read code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No language extensions are used in the provided snippet. The code uses standard inttypes format macros (PRIu32, PRId32) and project macros (LFS_TRACE, LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_ASSERT) but contains no compiler-specific extensions such as __attribute__, __asm, typeof, statement expressions, nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions. If any of the project macros expanded to a compiler-specific extension, that would be a violation, but based on the provided code there is no evidence of such expansions.",
