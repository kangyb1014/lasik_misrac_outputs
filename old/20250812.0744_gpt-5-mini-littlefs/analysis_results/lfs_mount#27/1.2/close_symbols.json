  "explanation": "For checking whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect any macros, casts, type uses, and callee declarations that could themselves rely on extensions or non\u2011standard constructs. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: it is invoked as a macro/function at the start. Its definition may use compiler extensions (e.g. statement expressions, builtin intrinsics, attributes, nonstandard inline assembly, or nonstandard locking primitives). You must see its definition to determine if an extension is used.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK for the unlock macro/function.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: this logging macro is used with a large format string and pointer casting. Its implementation may use variadic macros, GCC extensions (like statement expressions), __attribute__ annotations, or other non\u2011standard features \u2014 inspect its definition.\n\n- lfs_mount_: the function called by lfs_mount. Its declaration/definition can contain function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))) or nonstandard linkage or calling conventions; seeing its prototype/definition is necessary to decide if any language extension is relied upon by the call.\n\n- lfs_t: the typedef for the first parameter. Its definition may involve nonstandard attributes or extension types; inspect it to confirm standard C usage.\n\n- struct lfs_config: the full structure is referenced heavily. Its definition is needed to inspect field types and any attributes or compiler extensions applied to the struct or its members.\n\n- cfg->read (type), cfg->prog (type), cfg->erase (type), cfg->sync (type): the code casts these function-pointer members via (uintptr_t) and to void*. Converting function pointers to integer types or to void* may be implementation-defined or may be facilitated by nonstandard extensions. You must examine the declared types of these members to determine whether the casts rely on extensions or undefined/implementation\u2011defined behavior.\n\n- PRIu32 and PRId32: these format macros (normally from <inttypes.h>) are used in the format string. If the project provides nonstandard replacements or relies on macros that are compiler\u2011specific, that could be an extension. Verify their definitions.\n\n- uintptr_t: this integer type is used to cast function pointers before casting to void*. You must confirm that uintptr_t is the standard typedef (from <stdint.h>) and not a project/compiler extension; and check that using it for function-pointer-to-integer conversions does not depend on compiler extensions.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their headers/definitions) lets you determine whether any language/compiler extensions are present in the code paths or macros used by lfs_mount. Only after reviewing these can you conclude compliance with the MISRA rule forbidding language extensions."
