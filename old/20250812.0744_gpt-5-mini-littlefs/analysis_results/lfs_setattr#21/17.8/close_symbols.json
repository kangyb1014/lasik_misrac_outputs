  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: macro/function invoked at the start. Must inspect its definition/expansion to ensure it does not perform any assignment to the function parameters (for example via macro side-effects that rebind 'lfs' or other parameter identifiers). Also to confirm it does not expand into code that assigns to any parameter variables.\\n- LFS_UNLOCK: macro/function invoked before return. Like LFS_LOCK, its expansion could contain assignments; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not modify any of the function parameters.\\n- LFS_TRACE: logging macro used with the parameters (lfs, path, type, buffer, size). Macros can expand into statements that (unexpectedly) modify arguments or parameter variables (e.g. via ugly macro side-effects). Inspecting LFS_TRACE ensures it does not assign to any parameter variables.\\n- lfs_setattr_: the callee called with the same parameter identifiers. Although modifications performed inside the callee do not count as reassignments of the parameter variables inside lfs_setattr itself, lfs_setattr_ could be a macro or inline expansion that injects code into lfs_setattr. The actual definition must be checked to confirm it is a true function call (or, if a macro/inline, that it does not assign to the parameters).\\n- lfs_t (type definition): the parameter 'lfs' is a pointer to this type. Its definition (and the type of the cfg member) is needed to determine whether any of the macro expansions (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE) could legally alias or rebind the 'lfs' identifier or its members, and to rule out any uncommon macro tricks that modify parameter storage via member access."
