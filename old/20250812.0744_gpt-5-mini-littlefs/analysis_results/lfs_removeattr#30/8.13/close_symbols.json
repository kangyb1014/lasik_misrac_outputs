  "explanation": "- lfs_t: Needed to see the full definition of the structure so we can tell which members are being read or written by lfs_removeattr (e.g. whether lfs itself is modified). This determines whether the parameter lfs could be const-qualified.\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg field): The code passes lfs->cfg to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK. We must know the declared type and whether those lock operations modify the cfg object (and what pointer type they expect) to decide if lfs (or its cfg member) must be non-const.\n- lfs_removeattr_ (declaration/definition): lfs_removeattr calls lfs_removeattr_. We need the prototype and implementation to see whether it accepts a const lfs_t* or const char* or whether it modifies the object(s) pointed to (lfs or path). That directly affects whether the pointer parameters in lfs_removeattr should be const-qualified.\n- lfs_commitattr (declaration/definition): According to the call graph lfs_removeattr_ calls lfs_commitattr. To determine whether lfs_removeattr_ (and transitively lfs_removeattr) needs non-const pointers we must examine lfs_commitattr for any modifications to lfs or path.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/function): The lock/unlock macros/functions are called with lfs->cfg. Their prototypes/definitions tell us whether they mutate the cfg object (requiring non-const) or accept a const pointer. This affects whether lfs (or its cfg) can be const.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function): Same reason as LFS_LOCK; need its declaration/definition to determine whether it requires non-const access.\n\nNote: Also inspect any other functions called (or macros expanded) inside lfs_removeattr_ and lfs_commitattr that take pointers to lfs or path. The above list identifies the immediate symbols required to determine if the pointer parameters in the target function can/should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
