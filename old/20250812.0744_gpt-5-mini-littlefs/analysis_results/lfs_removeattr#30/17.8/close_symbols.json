  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: could be a macro or function with side effects (e.g. macro-expansion that assigns to or rebinds local variables). We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not modify the function parameters (lfs, path, type).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 unlocking may be a macro with side effects; definition needed to confirm it does not modify parameters.\n- LFS_TRACE: typically a logging macro; it may evaluate its arguments or expand to code that modifies values (or calls functions that do). Include its definition to ensure it does not assign to any parameter.\n- lfs_removeattr_ (definition): although a normal function cannot reassign the caller's parameter variables, lfs_removeattr_ might be a macro or inline function that could expand into code that modifies the caller's parameters. Its definition is required to be certain no parameter assignments occur inside the caller via expansion.\n- definition of lfs_t (structure, including cfg field): needed to understand the type and fields (especially cfg) passed into LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK and used by macros. This lets us determine whether any of the used expressions could legally or illicitly reassign the pointer parameters.\n\nThese symbols are the minimal set necessary to determine whether any code invoked or expanded in lfs_removeattr can perform assignments to the formal parameters (rebind lfs, path, or type) and thus violate the MISRA rule that function parameters shall not be modified."
