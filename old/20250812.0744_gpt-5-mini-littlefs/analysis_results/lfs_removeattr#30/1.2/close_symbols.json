  "explanation": "For MISRA rule checking of language extensions you must inspect any macro or function definitions that the target calls and the involved types: \n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function definition): The call LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) might be a macro that expands to GCC/clang statement-expressions ({ ... }), inline asm, __builtin_*, __extension__ tokens, or attributes. You need its definition to determine if a compiler-specific extension is used.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definition): Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its expansion/definition may use non\u2011standard language extensions.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro definition): Trace is almost certainly a macro (variadic or formatted). Its definition can use compiler-specific extensions (variadic-macro extensions, token\u2011pasting tricks like ##__VA_ARGS__, statement-expressions, attributes, inline asm, etc.). You must see it to decide compliance.\n- lfs_removeattr_ (declaration/definition): The target delegates the work to this helper. Its declaration/definition may carry nonstandard function attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))), calling\u2011convention pragmas, inline asm, or use of extended language constructs; you need it to determine whether the call chain introduces extensions.\n- struct lfs_t (type definition): The function accesses lfs->cfg; the layout or typedef of lfs_t may use compiler extensions (packed attributes, bitfields with implementation-defined widths, anonymous structs/unions, extension keywords). The type definition is required to check those.\n- type of lfs->cfg (the cfg struct/typedef): LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK receive this member; the cfg type definition may itself use extensions (e.g. flexible/unnamed members, attribute-packed, compiler-specific pragmas). Inspecting it is necessary to detect extensions used by the macros/functions operating on it.\n- uint8_t (typedef from <stdint.h>): Confirming this is the standard typedef (not a compiler-specific substitute) is needed to rule out nonstandard integer type extensions.\n- PRIu8 (macro from <inttypes.h>): The format specifier macro is a macro expansion; while standard, some projects provide custom/extension versions or wrap it in extension constructs. Its definition must be checked because it appears inside the format string (\"%\"PRIu8) and could hide an extension.\n\nProviding these definitions lets the next analyzer determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used in the target function (via macro expansions, attributes, builtins, inline asm, pragmas, or nonstandard type/format declarations)."
