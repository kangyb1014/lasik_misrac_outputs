  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The target function's first statement is \"int err = LFS_LOCK(cfg);\". LFS_LOCK may be a macro or function that contains control flow (e.g. return, longjmp, abort, or non-return attribute) or can otherwise affect reachability of the subsequent code. To determine whether the early return/remaining code is reachable we must see the expansion/definition of LFS_LOCK (and any functions it calls).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: The function calls LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) just before returning. If LFS_UNLOCK is a macro or function that does not return (or contains control flow that changes flow), code that follows lfs_format_ or the second LFS_TRACE call might be unreachable; we must inspect LFS_UNLOCK's definition/expansion.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: LFS_TRACE is used twice (printing an entry and an exit). Because it is almost always a macro, it could expand to nothing, to a function call, or to code that affects control flow (for example an assert/abort wrapper). To determine whether the code after lfs_format_ is reachable we need the LFS_TRACE definition/expansion.\n\n- lfs_format_: This is the core callee whose behavior directly determines reachability of the code that follows its call. If lfs_format_ never returns (calls exit/longjmp or is annotated noreturn), then the LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_format -> %d\", err); LFS_UNLOCK(cfg); return err; lines are unreachable. Inspecting lfs_format_ implementation (and any non-return functions it calls) is required.\n\n- struct lfs_config: The code indexes many fields of cfg when calling LFS_TRACE and passes cfg to LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK. The definition is needed to understand whether LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are macros that expand to members (e.g. cfg->lock) or to calls that could affect control flow; and to ensure use of cfg does not introduce hidden control-flow effects (via function pointer fields, custom lock/unlock hooks, etc.).\n\n- lfs_t: The target function takes an lfs_t *; while not used directly for control flow in this snippet, its type definition may be referenced by macros (or by lfs_format_/LFS_* macros). Include the type so any macro expansions or attributes referring to lfs_t can be inspected.\n\nNotes: If any of the above macros expand to calls to other functions (e.g. platform lock/unlock), include those callee definitions as well. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether any of the calls/macros in lfs_format can prevent later statements from being reachable (the MISRA unreachable-code concern)."
