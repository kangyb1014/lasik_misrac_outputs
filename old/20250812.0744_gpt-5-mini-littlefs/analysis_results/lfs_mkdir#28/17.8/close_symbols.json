  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked with lfs->cfg as an argument. If LFS_LOCK is a macro (or otherwise expands inline) it could contain assignments that modify the function parameters (e.g. assign to lfs or path). We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not reassign the pointer parameter 'lfs' or otherwise modify the parameter variables of lfs_mkdir.  \n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 check its definition to ensure it does not expand to code that assigns to the function parameters.  \n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is invoked with (void*)lfs and path. If LFS_TRACE is a macro (common for tracing) it may expand inline and could (incorrectly) modify its arguments. We need the macro definition to verify it only reads its arguments and does not assign to the parameter variables.  \n- lfs_mkdir_ (definition or macro): The call to lfs_mkdir_ could be either a function or a macro. If it is a macro that expands inline inside lfs_mkdir, that expansion could assign to the parameters. If it is a function, its body cannot reassign the caller's local parameter variables, but we still need to confirm which it is. Provide the definition or prototype to determine whether it is a macro/inline expansion or a normal call.  \n- lfs_t (type/struct): The LFS_LOCK call uses lfs->cfg; to reason about whether any macro might be modifying the pointer variable versus the pointed-to object we need the lfs_t definition (and the cfg member) to see how these expressions are formed and whether any macro could be manipulating the lfs identifier or its fields in a way that reassigns the parameter variable.  \nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any code that textually appears inside lfs_mkdir (including macro expansions) assigns to the parameter variables 'lfs' or 'path' and thus would violate the MISRA rule that function parameters shall not be modified."
