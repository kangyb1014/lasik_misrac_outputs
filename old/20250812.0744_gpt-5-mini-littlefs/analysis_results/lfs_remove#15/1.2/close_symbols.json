  "explanation": "You must inspect the macros, type and callee that the target function uses because MISRA\u2019s prohibition on compiler language extensions applies to macro expansions, type definitions, and any inline/auxiliary code they expand to. Reasons per symbol:\n- LFS_LOCK: lfs_remove directly calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). LFS_LOCK may be a macro or inline that could use compiler extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __attribute__, asm, nested functions, __builtin_*, etc.). Examining its definition is required to determine if the target function indirectly uses extensions.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK (may be a macro or wrapper using extensions).\n- LFS_TRACE: used for logging in the function. Its macro/implementation must be inspected because it frequently expands to helper calls, variadic macros, or compiler-specific constructs (statement-expr, __attribute__, __builtin_expect, token-pasting tricks). Even use of variadic macros is permitted by some compilers but may be considered an extension depending on the compiler/version\u2014so check the exact macro expansion.\n- lfs_remove_: the callee\u2019s declaration/definition should be visible to confirm it is not implemented as a nested function or using an extension in its prototype (e.g. unusual attributes) that would make the call site depend on extensions.\n- lfs_t: the type of the first parameter; its definition is required because macro expansions like LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) may access fields or rely on layout or inline functions inside the type that themselves use extensions.\n- type of lfs->cfg (e.g. struct lfs_config or lfs_cfg_t): the argument passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. The concrete config type may contain inline functions, macros, or attributes that are compiler extensions; you must inspect it to be certain the target function\u2019s use is free from extensions.\n- implementations/backing symbols used inside the LFS_TRACE macro (e.g. printf or logger helper): LFS_TRACE may expand to calls to printf-like functions or helper inline functions/macros that could use extensions; inspect those backing symbols to ensure no extension is used.\n\nInclude these symbols (their definitions/macros/implementations) in the next-agent prompt so the agent can determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are introduced into the target function via macros, types, or called/expanded code."
