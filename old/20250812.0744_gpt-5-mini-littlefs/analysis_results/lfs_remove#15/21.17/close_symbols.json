  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (concise):\n\n- lfs_remove_: The direct worker called by lfs_remove. The path parameter is forwarded to this function; any use of string.h functions will be inside it. You must inspect its implementation to detect out-of-bounds string/memory operations.\n\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_dir_drop: Directory-manipulation helpers likely to inspect or copy directory entry names and metadata derived from the 'path'. These are prime locations for calls to memcpy/memcmp/strncpy/strlen and must be checked for bounds and correct length usage.\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_fs_preporphans, lfs_gstate_hasorphans, lfs_fs_pred: Filesystem-level helpers invoked by lfs_remove_. They may traverse metadata structures and move or copy buffers that contain names or path-derived data; examine them for string/memory operations affecting path buffers.\n\n- lfs_tag_id, lfs_tag_type3: Tag parsing utilities used when reading directory entries. They may compute lengths, offsets, or perform memory comparisons (memcmp) on tag payloads \u2014 inspect for bounds correctness.\n\n- lfs_pair_fromle32: Binary decoding helper that may be used when computing sizes/offsets from on-disk data. Incorrect decoded values could lead to out-of-bounds memcpy/memmove calls elsewhere; include it to verify safe size calculations.\n\n- lfs_t: The filesystem context type. Its layout (pointers to buffers, scratch space, and state) and any buffers it owns are necessary to determine valid object bounds for copies or comparisons involving path data.\n\n- lfs->cfg (configuration structure and its fields): Config fields (max name length, block size, buffer sizes, etc.) define the valid ranges for path/name buffers. Any use of string functions must be compared against these limits to ensure no overflow \u2014 thus inspect cfg fields and how they are used by the callees.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro/function that receives the path string. Although usually not a string.h-use site, it can call formatting functions that read the path (e.g., snprintf) \u2014 include to verify it does not perform unsafe string operations on the provided path pointer.\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: Locking macros/functions are included only to confirm they do not modify or validate the path pointer or invoke any string handling on it; they are low priority but quick to check.\n\n- Any project-specific wrappers for memcpy/memcmp/strncpy/strlen (e.g. lfs_*mem* or lfs_str*): The codebase may use wrappers instead of the standard names. To be sure no out-of-bounds string operations occur, identify and inspect these wrappers used by the above functions.\n\n- constants/macros governing name/buffer sizes (e.g. LFS_NAME_MAX, block/buffer size macros): These determine allowed lengths for names/paths and are needed to reason about bounds checks performed before string/memory operations.\n\nIn short: start with lfs_remove_, then inspect all directory and filesystem helpers it calls, plus the filesystem context/config and any size-defining macros and string/memory wrappers. Those are the symbols that can contain or influence calls to string.h functions and therefore are necessary to determine compliance with the MISRA rule."
