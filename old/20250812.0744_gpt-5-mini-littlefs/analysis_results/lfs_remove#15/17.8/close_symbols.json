  "explanation": "To check MISRA C rule (a function parameter shall not be modified) for lfs_remove, we must be able to see any code that could assign to the formal parameters 'lfs' or 'path' inside the body (including macro expansions and inline code).\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is used at the start of lfs_remove and may be a macro that expands into code which could assign to the parameter variables (for example, a macro that evaluates or manipulates 'lfs'). We need its definition (or the function it expands to) to confirm it does not modify the parameter 'lfs' or 'path'.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Similar to LFS_LOCK, this macro/function is invoked before return; its expansion could modify the local parameter variables. Include its definition to ensure it does not assign to 'lfs' or 'path'.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro is called twice with (void*)lfs and path. Macros can contain arbitrary statements; we must inspect its expansion to ensure it does not assign to the function parameters (for example by reassigning 'path').\n\n- lfs_remove_: Although shown as a callee, confirm whether it is in fact a plain function or a macro/inline expansion. If it is a macro or inline that expands into code inside lfs_remove, that expansion could modify the parameters. Include its definition/prototype/implementation to rule out in-place modification of the parameter variables.\n\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): The code uses lfs->cfg. Knowing the definition of lfs_t (and the type of cfg) is necessary to understand what LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE might do with that field (e.g., if cfg is a macro that aliases something that leads to modifying the parameter variable). Also confirms that 'lfs' is a pointer parameter (not an array/other form) so that only assignments to the parameter identifier itself would violate MISRA (modifying *lfs is allowed)."
