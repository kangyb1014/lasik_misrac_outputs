  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_gc_: This is the direct callee of lfs_fs_gc; any use of memcmp on strings reachable from lfs_fs_gc will be inside this function, so its implementation is required.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency: Listed as a callee of lfs_fs_gc_; might contain memcmp usages that compare buffers which could be null-terminated strings \u2014 must inspect its code.\n- lfs_pair_isnull: Name suggests comparisons that may use memcmp to test for 'null' pairs; its implementation must be checked for memcmp-on-strings.\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Callee of lfs_fs_gc_; may perform buffer/string comparisons (e.g. names/keys) \u2014 include to check for memcmp misuse.\n- lfs_dir_commit: Callee of lfs_fs_gc_; similarly may compare directory entry strings with memcmp.\n- lfs_alloc_scan: Callee of lfs_fs_gc_; include because it may compare metadata buffers and could (incorrectly) use memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- memcmp: The standard library function in question \u2014 include its usages to determine whether any call compares null-terminated strings (the MISRA violation).\n- lfs_t: The filesystem state/type used by lfs_fs_gc; needed to understand what buffers/fields are passed into callee functions and whether those fields are null-terminated strings.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE: Macros used by lfs_fs_gc; while unlikely to implement memcmp on strings, include their definitions to rule out indirect memcmp usage (e.g. in trace or lock helpers) and to fully understand side-effects and parameters passed into callees.\n\nTogether these symbols give the reachable code and type context necessary to determine if any memcmp call reachable from lfs_fs_gc compares null-terminated strings (the MISRA C violation)."
