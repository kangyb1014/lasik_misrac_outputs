  "explanation": "lfs_fs_gc_ - The call may be a real function or a macro/inline. If it is a macro it could expand using the token \"lfs\" and assign to it (or otherwise alter the caller's parameter variable). We must inspect the definition/body to ensure the parameter identifier is not modified inside the expansion or implementation.\n\nLFS_LOCK - This is invoked with the expression lfs->cfg and may be a macro. A macro expansion can contain arbitrary code that might reference or assign to the identifier \"lfs\" (or otherwise perform an assignment to the parameter variable). Inspecting its definition is required to confirm it does not modify the function parameter itself.\n\nLFS_UNLOCK - Same rationale as LFS_LOCK: it may be a macro or function-like macro that could expand to code that modifies the parameter identifier. We need its definition to rule out assignments to the parameter variable.\n\nLFS_TRACE - Called with (void*)lfs and may be a macro. A trace macro might expand into code that references or assigns the symbol \"lfs\" (or performs unusual token pasting). Its definition must be checked to ensure it does not modify the function parameter identifier.\n\nlfs_t - The typedef/struct definition of lfs_t (including members, e.g. cfg) is required to confirm that \"lfs\" in this function is indeed a pointer variable (not a macro) and to understand whether member access expressions could hide any accidental reassignment of the parameter identifier. Knowing the type also helps determine whether any of the above macros/functions operate on the pointer itself versus the object it points to."
