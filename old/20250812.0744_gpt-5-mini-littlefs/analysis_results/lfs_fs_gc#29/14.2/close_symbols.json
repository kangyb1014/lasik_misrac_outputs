Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to check MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' for lfs_fs_gc:\n\n- lfs_fs_gc_: This is the direct callee of the target function. Any for-loops in lfs_fs_gc_ itself must be inspected (clauses, loop counter usage, side effects). Also the behaviour of any for-loop bodies in lfs_fs_gc_ includes the behaviour of functions it calls, so you must start here.\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan: These are the immediate callees of lfs_fs_gc_ (per the static call graph). If lfs_fs_gc_ contains for-loops that call these functions, or if these functions themselves contain for-loops, their bodies must be examined to ensure the for-loop second/third clauses do not have persistent side effects nor modify objects that are modified in the loop body. Also they may contain further function calls (transitive callees) or macros that affect loop counters; those will need to be inspected as discovered.\n\n- lfs_t (type): The structure definition (and in particular members like cfg) must be inspected because loop conditions or counters in the callee functions may reference members of lfs_t. The rule forbids using objects in the second/third clause that are modified in the loop body; thus you must know which members exist and their types/aliases to determine whether an identifier used as loop counter or flag is modified elsewhere.\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE (macros): The target function uses these macros. Although lfs_fs_gc contains no for-loops itself, these macros could expand to code that includes loops or side effects that affect objects used as loop counters or flags (or perform locking that interacts with called functions). To be safe, their expansions should be inspected to ensure they do not introduce loop behaviour or modify loop-controlling objects used by callee functions.\n\nNotes:\n- The analysis must follow the transitive call graph: if any of the listed callees call other functions, those transitive callees (and any macros/types they use) must also be included in the inspection until no further functions reachable from lfs_fs_gc_ remain. The list above is the minimal immediate set to begin a complete MISRA for-loop compliance analysis for lfs_fs_gc."
