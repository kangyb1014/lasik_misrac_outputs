  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions/expansions of these symbols to determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions (per the MISRA rule):\n\n- LFS_LOCK: likely a macro. Macros can hide compiler extensions (statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __asm__, __attribute__, token-pasting tricks like GNU \u2018##__VA_ARGS__\u2019, or other vendor extensions). The exact macro expansion is required to see if any non\u2011standard constructs are used when the target calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg).\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK\u2014inspect its definition/expansion for extensions.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: typically a logging macro that may expand to variadic macro constructs, helper macros, inline functions, or use of compiler attributes or builtins. You need its full definition (and any helper macros/functions it expands to) to detect usage of language/compiler extensions.\n\n- lfs_fs_gc_: the call target. If this symbol is implemented as a macro, inline function, or annotated with compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__, __nonnull, visibility attributes) those are language extensions that affect whether the calling code uses extensions. Inspect its declaration/definition.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition and the type of lfs->cfg): the structure/type of lfs (and specifically the type of the cfg field accessed here) may carry compiler-specific extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bit-field extensions, anonymous structs/unions as an extension in some compilers, or other vendor annotations). You must see the type definitions to determine whether the target function relies on any non\u2011standard language features.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their header/definition files and any macros they expand to) is sufficient to decide if the target function uses documented compiler language extensions."
