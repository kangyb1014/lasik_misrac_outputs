  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_fs_gc code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/232.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_fs_gc as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_fs_gc:\n```c\nint lfs_fs_gc(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_gc(%p)\", (void*)lfs);\n\n    err = lfs_fs_gc_(lfs);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_gc -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_fs_gc:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic int lfs_fs_gc_(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    // force consistency, even if we're not necessarily going to write,\n    // because this function is supposed to take care of janitorial work\n    // isn't it?\n    int err = lfs_fs_forceconsistency(lfs);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    // try to compact metadata pairs, note we can't really accomplish\n    // anything if compact_thresh doesn't at least leave a prog_size\n    // available\n    if (lfs->cfg->compact_thresh\n            < lfs->cfg->block_size - lfs->cfg->prog_size) {\n        // iterate over all mdirs\n        lfs_mdir_t mdir = {.tail = {0, 1}};\n        while (!lfs_pair_isnull(mdir.tail)) {\n            err = lfs_dir_fetch(lfs, &mdir, mdir.tail);\n            if (err) {\n                return err;\n            }\n\n            // not erased? exceeds our compaction threshold?\n            if (!mdir.erased || ((lfs->cfg->compact_thresh == 0)\n                    ? mdir.off > lfs->cfg->block_size - lfs->cfg->block_size/8\n                    : mdir.off > lfs->cfg->compact_thresh)) {\n                // the easiest way to trigger a compaction is to mark\n                // the mdir as unerased and add an empty commit\n                mdir.erased = false;\n                err = lfs_dir_commit(lfs, &mdir, NULL, 0);\n                if (err) {\n                    return err;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // try to populate the lookahead buffer, unless it's already full\n    if (lfs->lookahead.size < 8*lfs->cfg->lookahead_size) {\n        err = lfs_alloc_scan(lfs);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_fs_gc code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
