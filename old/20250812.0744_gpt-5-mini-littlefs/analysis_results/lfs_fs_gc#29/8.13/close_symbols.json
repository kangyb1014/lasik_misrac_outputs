  "explanation": "- lfs_t (struct definition): The target function takes lfs_t *lfs and dereferences lfs->cfg. To decide whether lfs_t * could be const (or whether fields could be const-qualified) we must see the full layout and types of its members.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg struct/type, e.g., lfs_config): lfs_fs_gc passes lfs->cfg to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. The const-qualification decision depends on the declared type of cfg and whether locking functions modify the cfg object; so the cfg type definition is needed.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro or function prototype/definition): lfs_fs_gc immediately calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). To determine whether the pointer argument should be const-qualified we need the prototype/definition to see the parameter type (const or not) and whether the function/macro modifies the object pointed to.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function prototype/definition): Similarly, LFS_UNLOCK is called with lfs->cfg; its declaration/definition shows whether it requires a non-const pointer or modifies the pointed object.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/function prototype): lfs is passed to LFS_TRACE. While tracing is usually non-modifying, its declaration (or macro expansion) must be checked to ensure it does not modify the object or require a non-const pointer.\n\n- lfs_fs_gc_ (prototype and implementation): lfs_fs_gc simply delegates to lfs_fs_gc_. If lfs_fs_gc_ modifies the filesystem state through the lfs pointer (or its cfg), then lfs_fs_gc cannot accept a const-qualified lfs pointer. The prototype shows parameter constness; the implementation shows whether it writes to the pointed object.\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan (prototypes/implementations): These are the direct callees of lfs_fs_gc_. To determine whether lfs_fs_gc_ (and therefore lfs_fs_gc) modify data reachable via the lfs pointer or its cfg, we must inspect these functions for writes to objects pointed to by lfs or cfg. If any of them require non-const pointers or perform modifications, that prevents qualifying the pointers as const in the higher-level function.\n\nIn short: you must inspect the types and full declarations/definitions of the lfs object and of every function/macro invoked (directly or indirectly) that receives pointers derived from lfs or lfs->cfg, to determine whether those functions modify the pointed-to objects and thus whether the pointers can/should be const-qualified."
