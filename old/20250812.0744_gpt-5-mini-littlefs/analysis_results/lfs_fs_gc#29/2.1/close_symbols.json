  "explanation": "To decide whether any code in lfs_fs_gc is unreachable you must know which calls and macros can alter normal control flow (return, longjmp, abort, infinite loop, or marked noreturn) and the types used by those macros: \n\n- lfs_fs_gc_: The direct callee \u2014 if it does not return (e.g. loops forever, longjmps, calls exit/abort, or is declared noreturn) then the trailing LFS_TRACE(\"-> %d\", err) and LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) in lfs_fs_gc would be unreachable. You must inspect its body and attributes.\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The locking macro/function controls the early-return path (if (err) return err;). You must know its semantics and whether it can itself not return or always return a constant, to determine reachability of the remainder of the function.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: The unlock macro/function is the statement whose reachability is in question; its definition could also affect control flow (e.g. may longjmp/abort) so inspect it.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing is a macro that may expand to code with side effects or control-flow changes (could be a no-op in some builds). Its expansion determines whether the trace calls could prevent reaching subsequent code.\n\n- lfs_t (type and definition): Needed because LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK and LFS_TRACE use lfs->cfg and pointer casts; the structure and cfg type may affect macro expansions and whether expressions have side effects that influence control flow.\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_pair_isnull, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_alloc_scan: These are the callees of lfs_fs_gc_ (transitively). To determine whether lfs_fs_gc_ returns normally you may need to inspect these functions for non-returning behavior, infinite loops, longjmp/exit/abort or attributes that make them alter control flow.\n\nInspecting the above symbols (definitions, attributes, and macro expansions) is sufficient to determine whether any statements in lfs_fs_gc are provably unreachable under the project's build configuration."
