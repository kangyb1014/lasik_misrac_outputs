  "scenario": "No violation: the pmutex argument passed to MHD_mutex_unlock_ refers to a mutex object that is modified by the unlock operation, so the pointer must be to a non-const type. Rule 8.13 requires pointers be const-qualified only when they need not be used to modify the pointee; here unlocking inherently modifies the mutex state, so making pmutex a pointer-to-const would be incorrect."
