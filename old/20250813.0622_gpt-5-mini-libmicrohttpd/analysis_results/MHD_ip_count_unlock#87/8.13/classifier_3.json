  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The code takes the address of daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex and passes it to MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_. The mutex unlock operation necessarily modifies the mutex state, so the pointer must refer to a non-const mutex object. Therefore the pointer cannot (and should not) be const-qualified in this use. A violation would occur if the function did not modify the pointed object but its parameter were non-const; that is not the case here."
