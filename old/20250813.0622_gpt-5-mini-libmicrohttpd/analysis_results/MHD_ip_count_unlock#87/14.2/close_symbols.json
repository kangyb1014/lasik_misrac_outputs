Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - The target function calls mhd_assert. The MISRA rule treats the behaviour of a function as including the behaviour of any functions it calls. mhd_assert may be a macro that expands to code (or calls) that contains control flow, including any for-loops or calls to other functions; its expansion must be inspected to ensure no nonconforming for-loops or side-effecting expressions appear in the target function's effective body.\n\n- MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_\n  - This is called directly from the function when threading is enabled. Any for-loops inside this function (or in functions it calls) would be part of the target function's behaviour for MISRA analysis. Inspecting its implementation is necessary to determine compliance.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (definition including members 'master' and 'per_ip_connection_mutex')\n  - The target references daemon->master and daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex. The exact types and possible accessor macros/inline functions for these members could hide code (including loops). You need the struct definition to see whether access involves any inlined code or side effects relevant to the for-loop rule.\n\n- type of daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex (e.g. MHD_mutex_t / pthread_mutex_t)\n  - The mutex member's concrete type (and any associated inline helpers) determine which unlock implementation is used and whether that implementation contains loops or modifies objects used by loop clauses. Knowing the type lets you find the correct unlock routine(s) to inspect.\n\n- underlying mutex-unlock implementation (e.g. pthread_mutex_unlock or ReleaseMutex / any MHD wrapper it calls)\n  - MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ may call lower-level unlock functions or wrappers. Those callees are part of the overall behaviour; they must be checked for any for-loops or side effects that would make a for-statement in the target (or its callees) ill-formed per MISRA.\n\n- MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS (preprocessor macro)\n  - The target function is conditionally compiled based on these macros. You must know which macro(s) are defined to determine which code path (the unlock call vs the (void) daemon;) is actually present for analysis.\n\n- MHD_USE_W32_THREADS (preprocessor macro)\n  - Same reason as above: to determine which branch is compiled and therefore which callees/behaviour to inspect for for-loops.\n\n- __builtin_unreachable (expansion target of assert)\n  - The static call graph shows __builtin_unreachable as a callee (likely coming from the assert expansion). Although __builtin_unreachable itself does not contain loops, the path to it (assert expansion) must be examined to see whether it introduces any control-flow or expressions that include loops or side effects relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\nIn summary: to decide whether MHD_ip_count_unlock violates the MISRA for-loop well-formedness rule you must inspect the implementations/expansions of every function and macro it invokes (mhd_assert and MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_), the concrete types and any inlined behavior of the daemon fields it reads, and the preprocessor macros that select the compiled path."
