  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed to judge unreachable code (MISRA rule):\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions (particularly MHD_RO_END): the switch contains a case for MHD_RO_END while the loop condition is while (MHD_RO_END != (ro = va_arg(...))). To prove the case label is unreachable you must know that MHD_RO_END is the sentinel value and how it compares to values pulled from the varargs list.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: the function reads and writes fields of this struct; to reason about reachability of the early return statements you need the structure type and the layout/meaning of the referenced fields.\n\n- struct MHD_Response::flags_auto: tested against MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH; knowing whether this field can be a compile-time constant or constrained by other invariants is necessary to determine whether the conditional block (and any returns inside it) can ever be reached.\n\n- struct MHD_Response::flags: used in bitwise tests against RF_* flags and assigned from the parameter 'flags'; its possible values affect whether the branches that return early are reachable.\n\n- struct MHD_Response::total_size: tested in (0 != response->total_size) to decide an early return; to decide reachability of that return you need the type and any invariants on this field.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH: this flag/macro is evaluated in a condition; its definition (value/meaning) is needed to reason about the conditional and whether that branch can be taken.\n\n- MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH and MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE: these bitflags are used in conditions that lead to early returns. Their definitions and any relationships between them affect whether the code that returns early can be executed.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO): the function returns these values; to reason about reachability of return statements and whether some paths are vacuous you need the result enumeration constants (and whether any of them are aliased or otherwise constrained).\n\n- va_start / va_arg / va_end (stdarg.h varargs semantics): the loop over varargs uses a sentinel pattern. To prove the MHD_RO_END switch case is unreachable (or not), you must rely on standard varargs semantics and the convention that the sentinel value terminates the loop; knowledge of how va_arg produces values and of any contract about the caller supplying MHD_RO_END is required.\n\nIn short: the unreachable-code analysis centers on the sentinel/value domain used by the varargs loop (MHD_RO_END and the enum of response options) plus the response fields and flag constants that govern the earlier conditional returns. Each listed symbol is necessary to determine whether particular branches or switch labels can ever be executed."
