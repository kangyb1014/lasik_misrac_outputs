  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nCalling strlen(username) without verifying that 'username' is non-NULL and NUL-terminated can read beyond the referenced object. In this function there is no runtime check of username != NULL or of its termination (only mhd_asserts, which may be disabled), so if a caller supplies a NULL pointer or a non-NUL-terminated buffer, strlen(username) will access out-of-bounds memory.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified get_nonce_timestamp code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/591.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of get_nonce_timestamp as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of get_nonce_timestamp:\n```c\nstatic bool\nget_nonce_timestamp (const char *const nonce,\n                     size_t noncelen,\n                     uint64_t *const ptimestamp)\n{\n  if (0 == noncelen)\n    noncelen = strlen (nonce);\n\n  if (true\n#ifdef MHD_MD5_SUPPORT\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (MD5_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_MD5_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT) || defined(MHD_SHA512_256_SUPPORT)\n      && (NONCE_STD_LEN (SHA256_SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE) != noncelen)\n#endif /* MHD_SHA256_SUPPORT */\n      )\n    return false;\n\n  if (TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN !=\n      MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ (nonce + noncelen - TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN,\n                             ptimestamp))\n    return false;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nPlease provide the modified get_nonce_timestamp code.\n",
