  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp are present in the provided code fragment. The only string operation is strlen and a call to MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_ to parse a numeric substring; neither is memcmp nor performs a comparison of null-terminated strings using memcmp. The length checks use integer comparisons and no memcmp-based string comparisons occur in the snippet, so there are no code fragments to investigate for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
