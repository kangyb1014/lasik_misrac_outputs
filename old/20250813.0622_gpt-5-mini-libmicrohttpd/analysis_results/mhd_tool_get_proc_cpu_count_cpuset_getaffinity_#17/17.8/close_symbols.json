  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they are required to judge the MISRA rule (\"A function parameter should not be modified\"): \n\n- cpuset_getaffinity: The function called to fill a cpuset. We must know its prototype and parameter semantics (which arguments are input vs output) to confirm no formal parameter of the target function would be modified (even though the target has no formals, cpuset_getaffinity may be a macro that could expand in surprising ways).\n\n- cpuset_t: The type of cur_mask and of CPU_ALLOC/CPU_COUNT(*/S) inputs; needed to determine whether cpuset_t is an array, pointer or other type that could hide modifications to function parameters via aliasing or macro expansion.\n\n- CPU_LEVEL_WHICH, CPU_WHICH_PID: Macros passed to cpuset_getaffinity; need their definitions to ensure they are simple constants and not macros that reference or modify function parameters.\n\n- id_t: Type used in the (id_t)-1 cast; obtain its definition to ensure no unexpected behavior (e.g., if id_t is a macro or function-like entity).\n\n- CPU_COUNT: Macro/function used to count bits in cur_mask. Need its definition to verify it does not modify any argument that could alias a function parameter.\n\n- CPU_ISSET: Macro/function used inside the loop to test bits of cur_mask. Its definition is required to ensure it is a read-only test and does not modify its cpuset argument.\n\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE: Loop bound macro used for scanning cur_mask. Its value/definition is needed to confirm loop behavior and rule-relevant side effects (e.g., if it is a function-like macro with side effects).\n\n- HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S, MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: Preprocessor feature-test macros controlling which blocks are compiled. To correctly decide whether the compiled/active code path could violate the MISRA rule we must know which of these are defined.\n\n- CPU_COUNT_S: The sized variant used on allocated masks; need its prototype/definition to know whether its parameters are input-only or could be modified (and whether the first argument is size in bytes vs CPU count depending on MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS).\n\n- CPU_SETSIZE: Used to compute mask_size_cpus; need its value/definition to confirm mask size calculation and any macro side effects.\n\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: Macro/function used to compute mask_size_bytes. Its definition is required to ensure it is a pure computation and not a macro that could modify parameters.\n\n- CPU_ALLOC: Allocator used to get p_mask. Need its signature and behavior (returns pointer, may be macro); ensure it does not modify any of this function's parameters and to understand ownership/aliasing for later calls.\n\n- CPU_FREE: Deallocator used on p_mask. Need its behavior to ensure it does not have side effects that could be seen as modifying function parameters.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule under check forbids modifying a function's formal parameters. The target function has no formal parameters, but to be certain the compiled code does not indirectly modify parameters (via macros, expansion, or called functions that may be defined as macros referencing caller parameters), the analyzer must have definitions/prototypes of all called functions, macros and types used in argument expressions and conditional compilation macros controlling which code is active. These symbols let the analyzer verify that all operations only touch local objects (cur_mask, p_mask, ret, locals) and do not alter any (nonexistent) formal parameter or cause hidden modifications through macro expansions."
