  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule about use of <string.h> functions (memcpy/memset/strlen/etc.) and bounds of pointer parameters you must inspect any symbols that allocate, size, or are written into by this function (or that change how sizes/counts are interpreted). Reason for each symbol:\n\n- cpuset_getaffinity: This function writes into the buffers (cur_mask or p_mask) passed by this routine. Its implementation could call memcpy/memmove/memset or otherwise access beyond the provided buffer; inspect it to ensure no out-of-bounds use of those library string functions on buffers supplied here.\n\n- cpuset_t: The concrete layout/size/alignment of cpuset_t determines how much memory cpuset_getaffinity, CPU_COUNT, CPU_ISSET, and CPU_COUNT_S will access. You must know its structure to reason about buffer sizes and pointer validity.\n\n- CPU_COUNT: Macro/function used on cur_mask. Its implementation could iterate or copy data and might use string.h functions; also it defines how many bits are interpreted and whether the stack cur_mask is large enough.\n\n- CPU_COUNT_S: Called on p_mask and passed either a byte size or a CPU count depending on the build. Its prototype/semantics are critical: if the first parameter is bytes vs CPU count, passing the wrong unit can cause it to read beyond p_mask (and its implementation may use memcpy/etc.). You must inspect its definition to check correct use and any internal string.h calls.\n\n- MHD_FUNC_CPU_COUNT_S_GETS_CPUS: This build-time macro selects whether CPU_COUNT_S expects number-of-CPUs or number-of-bytes. Its presence/absence changes the argument passed and therefore whether CPU_COUNT_S will access beyond p_mask; include it to know which code path to analyze.\n\n- CPU_ISSET: Used to test bits in cur_mask. Its implementation determines the allowed layout and indexing of cpuset_t and whether it performs any memory operations that could rely on buffer sizes.\n\n- CPU_ALLOC: Allocates the p_mask buffer. Its implementation and return size/behavior (e.g. using malloc+memset) determine how big p_mask actually is and whether internal use of memset/memcpy could overrun or rely on an expected size.\n\n- CPU_ALLOC_SIZE: Used to compute mask_size_bytes passed to cpuset_getaffinity and CPU_COUNT_S. You must confirm the semantics/formula (bytes vs other units) to ensure the size passed matches buffer allocation and CPU_COUNT_S expectation; wrong units can produce out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- CPU_FREE: Deallocation is less about string functions but include to inspect whether any wrapper does extra copying/clearing (memset) that could touch beyond the allocated area.\n\n- CPU_SETSIZE_SAFE and CPU_SETSIZE: These constants define iteration bounds and mask_size_cpus. They determine loop iteration counts and allocation sizes; incorrect definitions could cause loops or size computations that trigger out-of-bounds reads/writes or incorrect arguments to routines that may use string.h functions.\n\n- CPU_LEVEL_WHICH and CPU_WHICH_PID: Argument macros passed to cpuset_getaffinity \u2014 include to ensure cpuset_getaffinity is being invoked in the expected mode (which can affect how it fills the provided buffer and whether it assumes a particular buffer layout or size).\n\n- HAVE_CPUSET_GETAFFINITY, HAVE_CPU_COUNT, HAVE_CPU_COUNT_S: Build-time macros control which code paths are compiled. You must examine the combinations enabled in your build so you analyze only the actual compiled code paths and the correct implementations/variants of CPU_COUNT / CPU_COUNT_S / cpuset_getaffinity.\n\nIn short: to establish whether any string.h function is used in a way that accesses beyond the bounds of the objects passed from this function, you need the implementations/signatures/semantics of cpuset_getaffinity, the CPU_* allocation/size macros and allocation/free functions, the CPU_COUNT/_S implementations, cpuset_t layout, and the relevant build macros that change these semantics."
