  "explanation": "I inspected the entire provided function and the related macro definitions. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 concerns calls to the standard <string.h> functions (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) that could access beyond object bounds via their pointer parameters. The target function contains no uses of any <string.h> functions or any other string-handling functions taking pointer+length parameters. The function only calls sysconf (not a string function), performs integer comparisons and a cast with an overflow check, and returns an int. No buffers, no pointer arithmetic on character arrays, and no calls to the listed standard string functions are present. Therefore there are no code fragments in this snippet that are relevant to Rule 21.17 and nothing needs to be flagged for investigation under that rule."
