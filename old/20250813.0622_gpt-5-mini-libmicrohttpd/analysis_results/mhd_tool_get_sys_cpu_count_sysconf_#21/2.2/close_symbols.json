  "explanation": "- HAVE_SYSCONF: Preprocessor guard that entirely enables/disables the main body. Whether the code is compiled at all determines if it can be executed (alive) or is removed at compile time (not subject to dead\u2011code analysis at runtime).  \n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN: Controls compilation of the branch that calls sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN). Needed to know whether that call is present (affects reachability and side\u2011effects).  \n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROC_ONLN: Controls compilation of the alternative branch sysconf(_SC_NPROC_ONLN). Same reason as above.  \n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN: The macro passed to sysconf; presence/value is part of the platform API configuration and can impact whether the corresponding branch is valid/meaningful.  \n- _SC_NPROC_ONLN: Same as above for the alternate sysconf argument.  \n- sysconf: The function being invoked. To decide if the call is dead you must know whether sysconf has observable side effects or can affect program behaviour (returning different values, errno, etc.). If sysconf is a no\u2011op on the platform, the call might be dead; otherwise it is not.  \n- mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count: The caller of the target. You must inspect its control flow and how it uses the target\u2019s return value (order of attempts, short\u2011circuits, ignored return) to determine whether executing the target changes program behaviour.  \n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_: A sibling method invoked by mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count. If this (or another earlier method) always succeeds, the target might never be executed or its execution might be redundant\u2014affecting dead\u2011code determination.  \n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_: Same rationale as special_api_ \u2014 its success/failure and invocation order affect whether the target is reached and whether its work is necessary.  \n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count: Same rationale \u2014 another alternative source of the CPU count whose behavior affects reachability/necessity of the target.  \n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_: Fallback sibling; its presence/order may render the target unnecessary or vice versa.  \n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_: Another fallback sibling; needed to understand whether the target\u2019s functionality is duplicated or superseded by other code.  \n- detect_cpu_core_count: The higher\u2011level caller of mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count; knowing how the final result is used (or ignored) at the top level helps determine whether execution of the target ever affects observable program behaviour (timing/outputs), which is required to classify executed code as dead per MISRA.\n\nInclude these symbols so the next analyzer can determine (a) whether the target is even compiled into the build, (b) whether it can be reached in runtime call sequences, and (c) whether its calls (notably sysconf) have observable effects \u2014 all necessary to decide if executed code in the function would be dead code under the MISRA rule."
