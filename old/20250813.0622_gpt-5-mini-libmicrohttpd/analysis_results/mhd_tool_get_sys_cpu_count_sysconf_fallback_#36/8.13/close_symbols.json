  "explanation": "To determine whether this function could violate the MISRA rule about pointer const-qualification we must be sure there are no hidden pointer usages introduced by external declarations or macros. Each listed symbol is required for that check:\n\n- sysconf: The function calls sysconf. We need its prototype/definition to confirm its parameter and return types (e.g. long sysconf(int)). If sysconf were a macro or had a signature involving pointer types, that could trigger the MISRA pointer rule.\n\n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU and _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These are the names passed to sysconf (macros). Their definitions determine their type/expansion. If they expand to expressions that involve pointers (unlikely but possible on some platforms), that matters for the pointer constness analysis.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF, HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU, HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These configuration macros control which regions of the code are compiled. To know whether any code path introduces pointers (or a call to a different symbol with pointer parameters) we must know which of these are defined in the build.\n\n- <unistd.h> (or the header declaring sysconf/_SC_*): The standard header supplies the canonical declarations of sysconf and the _SC_* macros. Inspecting it ensures there are no unexpected pointer types or macro expansions that would implicate the MISRA pointer rule.\n\nNo other internal pointers appear in the function source itself; these symbols are sufficient to establish whether any external declaration or macro could introduce pointer usage requiring const qualification."
