  "explanation": "To determine whether this function uses any language/compiler extensions (per the MISRA rule), the analyzer must know which identifiers/macros come from the compiler/library or from project build-time configuration and whether they are documented compiler extensions: \n\n- sysconf: Need the declaration and the origin (POSIX/library vs compiler-specific extension). If sysconf were a compiler extension rather than a standard library/POSIX call, its presence could violate the rule. The function directly calls sysconf.\n\n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU and _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These parameter macros passed to sysconf may be vendor- or platform-specific (nonstandard) symbols. The analyzer must inspect their definitions and documentation to decide whether they are compiler/library extensions explicitly described as extensions.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCONF: This build-time macro controls whether the sysconf-based code is compiled. Knowing whether it is defined (and how it is set) is required to know if any extension symbols will actually be used in a given build.\n\n- HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU and HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF: These autoconf-style macros indicate whether the corresponding _SC_ macros are declared by system headers. Their definitions determine which branches are compiled and whether platform-specific macros are referenced.\n\n- <unistd.h> (or the specific system header that supplies sysconf and the _SC_ macros): Inspecting the actual header shows whether sysconf and the _SC_* macros are standardized (POSIX/C library) or introduced as implementation/compiler-specific extensions; it also shows any attributes or compiler-specific annotations attached to them.\n\nWith these symbols and their definitions/documentation, an analyst can decide if any of the used identifiers are documented compiler language extensions that would trigger the MISRA rule. No other local functions or types in the provided function are needed because the code uses only standard types and casts."
