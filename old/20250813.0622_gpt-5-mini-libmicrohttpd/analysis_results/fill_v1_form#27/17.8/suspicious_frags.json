  "explanation": "I found no fragments that modify any function parameter variables (the pointer parameters cls, mime, session, connection are not reassigned or otherwise modified). The code only: - casts cls to void to mark it unused (does not modify it), - reads session->value_1 via snprintf (modifies the object referred to by session is not done here), - passes session and connection to other functions (e.g., add_session_cookie, MHD_queue_response) but does not assign to the parameter variables themselves. According to Rule 17.8, modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter is permitted; only changing the pointer parameter itself (e.g., reassigning session = ..., mime = ..., etc.) would be a violation. No such reassignments or pointer modifications are present in the shown code, so there are no suspicious fragments to investigate for this rule."
