  "explanation": "I flagged all code fragments that directly invoke or rely on C string-handling functions (strlen, strstr) or that perform pointer arithmetic/indexing and prefix comparisons that may cause subsequent string functions to read past object bounds. Other parts of the provided code do not require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because they either do not call any of the <string.h> functions listed in the rule, operate only on string literals (which are NUL-terminated and therefore safe for strlen/other reads when used directly), or perform memory allocation/initialization without invoking standard string-handling routines. In particular, the header/struct definitions and the iteration logic in MHD_get_connection_values do not themselves call the standard string functions named by the rule (they merely pass pointers to an external iterator), and allocation calls (e.g. MHD_calloc_) and simple numeric checks do not by themselves cause out-of-bounds accesses by the standard string functions. Investigations should focus on the listed fragments where standard string operations or pointer arithmetic followed by string operations occur."
