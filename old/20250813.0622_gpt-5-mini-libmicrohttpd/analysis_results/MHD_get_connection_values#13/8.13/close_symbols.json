  "explanation": "To decide if pointers in MHD_get_connection_values should be const-qualified you must know the exact declarations and prototypes the function uses:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection (full definition): needed to determine whether the function parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' could safely be 'const struct MHD_Connection *' (i.e. whether any member is modified here or elsewhere) and to locate the rq member.\n\n- definition of the type of connection->rq (the struct that declares headers_received) / declaration of headers_received member: headers_received is accessed directly (connection->rq.headers_received). The concrete type and qualifiers of that member determine whether the pointer to it (and to the chain of request headers) could be const.\n\n- struct MHD_HTTP_Req_Header (full definition): pos is that type; we must know the exact types and const-qualifiers of its fields (kind, header, value, next). In particular, whether header and value are declared as char * or const char * (or other pointer types) dictates whether they should be const-qualified here.\n\n- typedef MHD_KeyValueIterator (function pointer prototype): the iterator is invoked with iterator_cls, pos->kind, pos->header, pos->value. If the iterator prototype takes non-const pointers for header/value or a non-const connection class pointer, that constrains whether those pointers (and therefore fields/types) can be changed to const.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (definition): needed to confirm the type of pos->kind and the iterator's kind parameter; while not directly about constness, the exact type/signature is part of the prototype analysis.\n\n- MHD_NO (macro/enum constant definition): present in the conditional comparing the iterator result. Not directly about const qualification but required to fully understand the iterator usage and return semantics when reasoning whether the iterator needs non-const pointers.\n\nHaving these symbol definitions lets an analyst determine if any of the pointer types (the connection parameter, headers_received pointer, MHD_HTTP_Req_Header->header/value, iterator parameters) could be declared const without breaking existing prototypes or semantics, which is what the MISRA rule requires."
