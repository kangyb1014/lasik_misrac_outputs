  "explanation": "Other parts of the function use standard ISO C constructs and do not involve compiler-specific language extensions: parameter and return types (struct, enum, pointers), local variable declarations, the for loop, if statements, NULL comparisons, bitwise & operator, function-pointer invocation (iterator), and return statements are all standard C language features or standard preprocessor macros. No other compiler-specific extensions (such as inline assembly, typeof, statement expressions, non-standard keywords, or other vendor-specific attributes/pragmas) are present in the shown code, so they do not require investigation for Rule 1.2."
