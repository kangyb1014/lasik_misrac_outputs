  "explanation": "The remaining pointer uses do not appear to violate Rule 8.13: cls is declared as const void * and mime as const char * (they are already const-qualified). The NOT_FOUND_ERROR macro expands to a string literal and is passed as a const void * to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, so the pointed-to data is treated as const. The local variable struct MHD_Response *response is used with functions that modify/destroy the response object (MHD_add_response_header, MHD_destroy_response), so it should not be const. The header macro MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_ENCODING is a string literal and is therefore inherently constant. These fragments therefore do not require investigation for missing const qualification under Rule 8.13."
