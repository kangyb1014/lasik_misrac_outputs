  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe if (1) wrapper is an unconditional conditional whose condition is always true; evaluating that condition and branching is an operation that can be removed without changing program behaviour (the block is always executed). The if (1) is therefore dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Replace the if (1) ... with a plain block { ... } (or remove the if) to avoid the violation.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified not_found_page code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/554.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of not_found_page as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of not_found_page:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nnot_found_page (const void *cls,\n                const char *mime,\n                struct Session *session,\n                struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  (void) cls;     /* Unused.
