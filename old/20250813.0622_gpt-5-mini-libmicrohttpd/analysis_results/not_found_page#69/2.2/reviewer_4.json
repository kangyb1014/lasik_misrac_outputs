  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The lines \u201c(void) cls;\u201d and \u201c(void) session;\u201d are the common, deliberate idiom to mark parameters as unused and to suppress compiler warnings. Although these expression-statements perform no value-affecting computation at runtime, MISRA Rule 2.2 targets genuinely dead code whose removal would not affect program behaviour in the sense of the program\u2019s observable actions (and typically covers unreachable code, unused procedures/objects, or code that can safely be removed because it has no role). Casting a parameter to void is an explicit documentation/diagnostic-suppression measure; toolsets and MISRA guidance do not treat this idiom as a defect of the kind Rule 2.2 intends to forbid. Moreover, \u201cbehaviour\u201d in the rule includes timing/side-effects considerations (note 1), so a naive textual claim that removal \u201cwould not affect program behaviour\u201d is not universally safe. Finally, the empty test log simply shows the function wasn\u2019t exercised during the test; it doesn\u2019t demonstrate a Rule 2.2 violation. Therefore the agent A report is incorrect."
