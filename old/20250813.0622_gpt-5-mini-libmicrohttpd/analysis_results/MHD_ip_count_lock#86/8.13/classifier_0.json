  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The function needs to call MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex), which mutates the mutex state; if daemon were declared as const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon the member per_ip_connection_mutex would be const and could not be passed to a locking function that expects a non-const mutex pointer. Apart from the read in mhd_assert, the code performs a non-const operation on a member, so the pointer must remain non-const."
