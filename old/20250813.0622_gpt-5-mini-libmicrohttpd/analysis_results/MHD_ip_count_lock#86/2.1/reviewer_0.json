  "explanation": "The agent\u2019s claim is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.1 concerns unreachable code in the project\u2019s translation units (i.e. the code that actually becomes part of the built project). The #else branch here is excluded by the preprocessor when MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS (or MHD_USE_W32_THREADS) is defined, so that branch is not present in the translation unit(s) produced for that project configuration. Code that is eliminated by preprocessing is not \u201cunreachable\u201d at runtime within the built project \u2014 it simply does not exist in the build. The empty test log does not prove a rule violation (the function may never have been called in the test run). If, however, the project were to include a build configuration that compiles the #else branch while that branch could never be executed at runtime, then a Rule 2.1 finding might be applicable; that is not the situation described. Therefore the report is incorrect."
