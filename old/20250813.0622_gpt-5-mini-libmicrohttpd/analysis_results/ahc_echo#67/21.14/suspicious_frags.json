  "explanation": "No occurrences of memcmp were found in the provided ahc_echo function or the related helper (MHD_str_equal_caseless_). Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings; the code uses strcmp for method comparisons and a character-by-character loop in MHD_str_equal_caseless_, neither of which invoke memcmp. Pointer comparison (&aptr != *req_cls) and calls to strlen/MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static operate on null-terminated strings but do not use memcmp. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied sources that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. If memcmp is used elsewhere (e.g., in other modules or linked libraries), those locations would need review, but they are not present in the supplied code."
