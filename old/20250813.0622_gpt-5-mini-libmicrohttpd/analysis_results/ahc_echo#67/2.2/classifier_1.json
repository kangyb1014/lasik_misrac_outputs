  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of ahc_echo:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nahc_echo (void *cls,\n          struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n          const char *url,\n          const char *method,\n          const char *version,\n          const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size, void **req_cls)\n{\n  static int aptr;\n  struct handler_param *param = (struct handler_param *) cls;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  (void) cls;               /* Unused.

  "scenario": "The statement '(void) cls;' is an expression statement that is executed but has no effect on program behaviour; removing it would not change runtime behaviour (only compiler diagnostics). Therefore it constitutes dead code under Rule 2.2. Note: the same applies to the other '(void) ...' unused-parameter casts in the function."
