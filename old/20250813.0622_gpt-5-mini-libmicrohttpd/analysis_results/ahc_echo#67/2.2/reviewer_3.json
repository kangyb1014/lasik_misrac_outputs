  "explanation": "Agent A is correct. The statement \u201c(void) upload_data;\u201d is an executed no\u2011op for a typical non\u2011volatile parameter: it evaluates the parameter (reads the pointer value) but produces no side effects and its removal would not change program behaviour. That matches the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so the report is valid. Caveats: if the expression had observable side effects (for example the operand involved volatile access or a function call) then the cast would not be dead; also some projects tolerate the (void)param idiom as a documented, tool\u2011silencing convention and handle it via a deviation or a dedicated UNUSED macro, but that is a procedural exception outside the pure wording of Rule 2.2."
