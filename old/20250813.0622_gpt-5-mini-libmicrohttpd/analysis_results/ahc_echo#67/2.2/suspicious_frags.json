  "explanation": "The listed (void)/*...*/ lines are expression statements that have no effect at runtime; removing them would not alter program behavior, so they are candidates for dead-code investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Other fragments in the function are not reported because they have observable effects or are necessary for control flow: the strcmp checks and early returns determine accepted HTTP methods and change behavior; the &aptr / *req_cls logic and the subsequent assignment *req_cls = NULL affect future calls and connection handling; MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response perform essential runtime actions (creating, queuing and freeing responses) and cannot be removed without changing behavior; the return values (ret) are used to propagate results; the casts used as function-call arguments are compile-time/type operations and not runtime no-op statements in the same sense as the (void) expressions. Therefore no other statements appear to be dead code and do not require investigation for Rule 2.2 in this fragment."
