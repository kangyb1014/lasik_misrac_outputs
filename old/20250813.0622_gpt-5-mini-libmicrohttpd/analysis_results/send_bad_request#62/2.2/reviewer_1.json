  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following send_bad_request code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of send_bad_request.\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nsend_bad_request (struct MHD_Connection *con)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *res;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  res =\n    MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (strlen (BAD_REQUEST_PAGE),\n                                            (const void *) BAD_REQUEST_PAGE);\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (con, MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, res);\n  MHD_destroy_response (res);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:In MHD_connection_handle_idle the local variable 'daemon' is explicitly cast to void via the statement '(void) daemon; /* Mute compiler warning */'. That cast is an executed no-op (has no side effects) whose removal would not change program behaviour, so it constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nsend_bad_request (struct MHD_Connection *con)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *res;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  /* Probe state: measure length once to avoid calling strlen repeatedly */\n  size_t len = strlen (BAD_REQUEST_PAGE);\n\n  /* Open log file for append.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The submitted target function send_bad_request does not contain the statement '(void) daemon;' \u2014 the agent is attributing a no-op cast in a different function (MHD_connection_handle_idle) to the send_bad_request code, so the scenario and the target code do not match. Even if a statement '(void) daemon;' exists elsewhere, the situation is not a straightforward MISRA 2.2 violation in practice: while the cast is an executed no-op whose removal would not change runtime behaviour (so by a literal reading it meets the definition of dead code), such idioms are commonly used intentionally to silence unused\u2011variable warnings or document intentionally unused parameters. That intent must be judged in the project context and typically requires a justification or an accepted deviation rather than being treated as a plain rule breach. In short: the agent's claim is incorrect for the provided target, and the reasoning (equating the deliberate (void) cast with an unqualified Rule 2.2 violation) is too simplistic without project-level justification or the actual matching code fragment."
