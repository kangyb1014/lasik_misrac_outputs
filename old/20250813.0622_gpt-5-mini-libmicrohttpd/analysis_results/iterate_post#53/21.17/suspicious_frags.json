  "explanation": "Other code fragments in iterate_post do not need investigation under MISRA C Rule 21.17 because they do not invoke or pass pointers to the standard string-handling functions covered by the rule, nor do they perform string operations that could read or write beyond object bounds. Examples of such safe fragments include the (void) casts for unused parameters, local variable declarations, the else branch that sets con_info->answerstring = NULL, and the function return statements. These do not perform pointer-based string accesses and therefore are not relevant to this rule."
