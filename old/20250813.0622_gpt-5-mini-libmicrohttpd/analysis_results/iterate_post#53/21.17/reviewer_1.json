  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following iterate_post code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of iterate_post.\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\niterate_post (void *coninfo_cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key,\n              const char *filename, const char *content_type,\n              const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, uint64_t off,\n              size_t size)\n{\n  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls;\n  (void) kind;               /* Unused.

Later snprintf(..., GREETINGPAGE, data) uses %s which scans until a NUL; therefore snprintf can read past the 'size' bytes of the POST data and access memory beyond the object. Example: an input of exactly MAXNAMESIZE non-NUL bytes with size == MAXNAMESIZE passes the check but causes snprintf to read out-of-bounds. This constitutes an out-of-bounds access by a string-handling operation.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nstatic enum MHD_Result\niterate_post (void *coninfo_cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key,\n              const char *filename, const char *content_type,\n              const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, uint64_t off,\n              size_t size)\n{\n  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls;\n  (void) kind;               /* Unused.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s runtime scenario is correct: if the POST buffer 'data' is not NUL-terminated within the provided 'size' bytes, calling snprintf(..., GREETINGPAGE, data) where GREETINGPAGE contains a %s will cause snprintf to read past the 'size' bytes and thus potentially access memory out of bounds. That is a real defect/risk in the code. However, MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (as quoted) is specifically about the use of the string handling functions from <string.h> (examples: memcpy, memmove, strlen, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strspn, etc.). The problematic function here is snprintf (a formatting function from <stdio.h>), not one of the <string.h> functions. Therefore the scenario describes an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read, but it does not violate MISRA Rule 21.17 as stated. In short: the reported unsafe behavior is valid, but the attribution to Rule 21.17 is incorrect. Recommended fixes include: ensure the incoming data is NUL-terminated before passing it to %s, or use a bounded format such as %.*s with (int)size, or copy size bytes to a temporary buffer and append a NUL before using %s."
