  "explanation": "1) strcmp \u2014 The source/reference implementation or declaration of strcmp is needed to determine whether the call in the target function is a plain library strcmp or an alias/wrapper that calls memcmp (directly or indirectly). If strcmp is implemented via memcmp the MISRA prohibition may be triggered even though the source uses strcmp.\n\n2) memcmp \u2014 You must inspect memcmp itself and its usages/aliases to see whether it is being used to compare NUL\u2011terminated strings (directly in the project code or indirectly via wrappers such as strcmp). If strcmp or any other routine used here delegates to memcmp for NUL\u2011terminated string comparison, that violates the rule.\n\n3) string.h (declarations / any inline/macro definitions for strcmp/memcmp) \u2014 The standard header (or the platform's implementation of it) can contain macros, inline implementations or aliases that change the semantics (e.g. #define strcmp memcmp or inline wrappers). Checking the header content shows whether strcmp is the standard function or mapped to memcmp.\n\n4) libmicrohttpd iterate_post callback prototype / documentation (semantic guarantee that 'key' is a NUL\u2011terminated C string) \u2014 The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings. To decide whether the comparison here is of NUL\u2011terminated strings you must know the semantics of the 'key' parameter provided by the library (i.e. whether it is guaranteed to be a C NUL\u2011terminated string). If 'key' is not NUL\u2011terminated then memcmp-style comparisons could be permissible; if it is NUL\u2011terminated then any use of memcmp to compare it would violate the rule.\n\n5) project / platform headers that might #define or inline strcmp (any macro or inline symbol that aliases strcmp to memcmp) \u2014 In addition to string.h, project- or platform-specific headers may redefine or inline strcmp to call memcmp. These header-level aliases must be inspected to ensure the call in the target function does not end up invoking memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings."
