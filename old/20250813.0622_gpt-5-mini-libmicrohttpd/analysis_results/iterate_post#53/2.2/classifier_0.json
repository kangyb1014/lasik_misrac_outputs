Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of iterate_post:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\niterate_post (void *coninfo_cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key,\n              const char *filename, const char *content_type,\n              const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, uint64_t off,\n              size_t size)\n{\n  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls;\n  (void) kind;               /* Unused.
