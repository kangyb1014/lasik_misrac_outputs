  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. The cast-to-void statements in iterate_post are an explicit, intentional idiom to mark parameters as unused (they suppress compiler diagnostics and document intent). More importantly, the MISRA text itself warns that observable behaviour can include timing; removing even a single no-op expression can in principle change timing/side\u2011effects in an embedded system, so you cannot automatically classify these statements as dead code. In practice (void)parameter; is the accepted way to indicate an unused parameter and is not treated as a Rule 2.2 violation in this context. Therefore agent A\u2019s report is not correct."
