  "explanation": "1) struct connection_info_struct (complete definition): The MISRA rule under inspection concerns pointer target const-qualification. The critical member here is con_info->answerstring; its declared type (char * vs const char *) determines whether the assignment con_info->answerstring = answerstring violates or conforms to the rule. The full struct is required to see the member's type and any qualifiers.\n\n2) all symbols that read, write, assign or free connection_info_struct::answerstring: To decide whether answerstring can/should be const-qualified you must know how it is used elsewhere. If other functions modify the pointed-to buffer (write characters into it) or call free() on it (which may require removing const), the member must remain a mutable pointer (or those callers must cast). If other code only reads the string, the member could be const-qualified. So every call site that accesses that member is needed.\n\n3) declaration/typedef of the libmicrohttpd post-iterator callback type and the registration function(s) where iterate_post is passed: The first parameter is coninfo_cls (void *). To determine whether it could be a pointer-to-const (e.g. const void *) you must inspect the callback type expected by the library or the registration API: if the library API requires a non-const void * (it will later mutate it), you cannot change it to a const-qualified pointer. The prototype/typedef at the registration site tells you whether the API forces a non-const pointer.\n\n4) declaration of snprintf (signature): snprintf's first parameter is a non-const char * destination; that fact shows that the buffer pointed to by local answerstring must be writable. This affects whether the struct member can be declared const char * (it could still point to a writable buffer written before storing the pointer, but if other code writes via the stored pointer later, the member must be mutable). Having the snprintf signature in hand avoids mistaken assumptions about required mutability.\n\n5) declarations of malloc and free: Knowledge of allocation/freeing sites and their prototypes is needed to determine whether con_info->answerstring is passed to free() or other APIs that expect void * (which would require dropping const). That affects whether the member can be const-qualified without causing casts or API mismatches.\n\n6) MAXNAMESIZE, MAXANSWERSIZE, GREETINGPAGE definitions: GREETINGPAGE is used as the format string and MAXANSWERSIZE controls the allocation/size. The type/definition of GREETINGPAGE (if it is e.g. a macro producing a mutable char[] vs a const char *) and the buffer sizing may influence whether the buffer is treated as mutable or immutable in other code paths; they are small but useful context when deciding whether answerstring can/should be const-qualified.\n\nProviding these symbols allows the next analyst to determine: (a) whether any pointer parameters or stored pointers could be declared with a const target without breaking API contracts, and (b) whether stored buffers are modified elsewhere (so must remain mutable)."
