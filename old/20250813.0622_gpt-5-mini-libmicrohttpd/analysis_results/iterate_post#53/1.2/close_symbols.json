  "explanation": "For each symbol below I state why its definition is required to determine whether the target function uses any compiler/language extensions.\n\n- MHD_Result: The function return type is an enum MHD_Result. Its declaration may use non\u2011standard extensions (e.g. compiler attributes, fixed underlying type specifiers, or macros replacing it). Need the definition to determine whether an extension is used.\n\n- MHD_ValueKind: The parameter type. Its definition could contain compiler extensions (attributes, bitfields, non\u2011standard enum syntax) or be a typedef to a compiler\u2011specific type; verify it is plain standard C.\n\n- struct connection_info_struct: The code casts a void* to this struct pointer and assigns to its member answerstring. The struct definition might use non\u2011standard features (bitfields with implementation\u2011defined widths, anonymous structs/unions, GNU extensions, __attribute__ annotations, flexible array members in non\u2011standard ways) that would violate the rule. Need the full struct to check for such extensions and to confirm member types.\n\n- MAXNAMESIZE: Used in the bounds check. It may be a macro or enum constant; macros can hide extension use (e.g. statement expressions, typeof, token pasting) or non\u2011standard integer expressions. Need its definition to ensure no language extensions are used.\n\n- MAXANSWERSIZE: Used for malloc size and snprintf limit. As with MAXNAMESIZE, its definition as a macro or constant must be inspected for compiler extensions.\n\n- GREETINGPAGE: Used as the snprintf format string. GREETINGPAGE may be a macro or expression that uses non\u2011standard constructs (stringizing, variadic macro extensions, GNU string literal concatenation tricks). Its definition must be checked for extensions.\n\n- MHD_NO and MHD_YES: Returned from the function. They may be enum constants or macros that expand to expressions or use attributes/inline assembly or other non\u2011standard constructs. Need their definitions to ensure they are standard C identifiers/constants.\n\n- malloc: Allocator call. The implementation could be a macro or inline wrapper that relies on compiler builtins or extensions (or be redefined by the project). Confirming the prototype/definition ensures no project\u2011specific extension is invoked here.\n\n- snprintf: Formatted output function. Some platforms provide snprintf as a macro or a wrapper using compiler builtins (e.g. __builtin_snprintf), or there may be project replacements that use extensions. Inspecting its declaration/definition verifies whether an extension is being used.\n\n- strcmp: Used for key comparison. Like other library calls, strcmp could be redefined as a macro or inline builtin. Check its declaration/definition to ensure standard usage.\n\n- uint64_t: Parameter type for off. It is a fixed\u2011width integer type from <stdint.h>; some projects/compilers provide it via nonstandard typedefs or extensions. Need to confirm it is the standard typedef and not a compiler extension.\n\n- size_t: Used for size argument. Its definition may vary by platform; verify it is the standard typedef from <stddef.h>/<stdint.h> and not a compiler extension.\n\n- NULL: Used implicitly/explicitly in assignments. NULL could be defined in a non\u2011standard way (e.g. as ((void*)0) vs 0) or redefined; check its definition in the project headers to ensure no extension is present.\n\nInspecting these symbol definitions (and any headers that define them) lets an analyst determine whether any non\u2011standard compiler or language extensions (attributes, builtins, GNU statement expressions, non\u2011standard enum/typedef forms, inline assembly, etc.) are used by the target function or by symbols it relies on."
