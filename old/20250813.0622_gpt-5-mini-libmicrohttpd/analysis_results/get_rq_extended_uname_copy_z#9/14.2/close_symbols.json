  "explanation": "To determine whether get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z can cause a MISRA violation of the \"for loop shall be well\u2011formed\" rule we must know if it (or functions it calls) can modify objects that are used as loop counters or loop control flags in any enclosing for loop (MISRA treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body). The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- get_rq_uname: This function is a direct caller of get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z. To decide whether calling get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z from inside a for loop in get_rq_uname could break the rule, we must inspect get_rq_uname's loop(s), their loop counter identifiers, and whether those counters (or loop control flags) might be modified by get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z (directly or indirectly).\n\n- digest_auth_check_all_inner: Another direct caller. Same reason as above \u2014 any for loops in this caller that invoke get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z must be inspected to see if this callee modifies the caller's loop counter or flags.\n\n- MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_: This function is called from get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z and writes to the buffer (returns w). Its implementation may contain for loops or modify objects (via pointers/global state) that could be considered loop counters in a caller. We must inspect it to ensure it does not modify any caller loop counters or have side effects that violate the rule.\n\n- toxdigitvalue: Called by MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_. Any side effects or use of global/state here that could affect loop counters must be checked (and its own loops examined) because its behaviour is part of the overall called-function behaviour inside any enclosing for loop.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: Called early for prefix comparison. Inspect to ensure it has no side effects (no modifications of caller loop counters or global objects used by callers' loops) and whether it contains any for loops that could themselves be ill\u2011formed.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_: Macro/function giving the prefix length. Needed to determine initial index r and to reason about which objects are read/used in loops (helps map which variables may be used as loop counters in callers and whether they are modified).\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_PREFIX: The prefix constant used to compute r. Required to understand r's initialization and control flow; helps prove that get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z does not depend on or modify external loop counters.\n\n- MHD_DAUTH_EXT_PARAM_MIN_LEN: Used in an early length check; required to verify control flow and early returns and to show that no hidden side effects modify caller loop counters under certain conditions.\n\n- SSIZE_MAX: Used in range check and assertion; needed to reason about conversions/returns and whether any integer promotions or assignments could change objects that might be loop counters in a caller.\n\n- mhd_assert: The assert macro/function may expand to code that has side effects in some builds; must be inspected to ensure it does not modify objects that could be loop counters.\n\nIn short: inspect the caller functions (to find the for loops and their counters) and all direct callees (and their callees) invoked from get_rq_extended_uname_copy_z to ensure none of them modify any object that could be used as a for\u2011loop counter or control flag in an enclosing for loop. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to perform that check."
