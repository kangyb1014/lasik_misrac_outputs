  "explanation": "Each listed symbol is referenced (directly or via conditional compilation) by process_upload_data and is needed to determine whether the code uses compiler or platform language extensions rather than standard C:\n\n- enum MHD_Result: the return type; need its definition to see if nonstandard attributes/qualifiers or compiler-specific extensions are applied to the enum declaration.\n- struct UploadContext: required to inspect field types (fd, category, language, response, filename) and detect use of nonstandard types or compiler-specific extensions (bit-fields, packed/aligned attributes, anonymous structs, GCC extensions, nonportable integer types).\n- request_refused_response, internal_error_response: external symbols assigned to uc->response \u2014 need their declarations/types to check for nonstandard types or extension use in their definitions.\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO: macros or enum constants used as return values; need their definitions to ensure they are standard constants and not compiler-specific constructs.\n- PATH_MAX: platform-specific constant; its presence/definition can be an implementation extension (limits.h) and influences buffer sizing behavior \u2014 check whether its use relies on nonstandard behavior.\n- mkdir, S_IRWXU: mkdir signature differs between platforms; S_IRWXU is a POSIX macro for mode bits \u2014 their presence may indicate POSIX-specific code (an extension relative to pure ISO C). Need to inspect conditionalization and definitions.\n- O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_LARGEFILE, O_WRONLY: open flags; O_LARGEFILE in particular is a Linux/GLIBC extension for large-file support. These macros are nonstandard relative to ISO C and must be checked for platform-specific extension usage.\n- S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR: POSIX file-permission macros; their use signals POSIX extensions rather than pure ISO C.\n- open, write, close, unlink: POSIX system calls; verify whether usage conforms to standard library or relies on platform-specific behavior (e.g., write signature differences and conditional cast for Windows). These are central to deciding if the code uses nonstandard system interfaces.\n- strdup: not part of ISO C90 (POSIX/BSD), so its use may be an extension; need its availability and semantics on the target platform.\n- fprintf, stderr, strerror, errno: C library functions/macros \u2014 check they are used in standard ways; errno and strerror may be thread-local or macro-mapped on some implementations (extensions).\n- isprint, strchr, strstr: C library functions from <ctype.h> and <string.h>; include to ensure standard usage and no extension-specific variants.\n- snprintf: C99 function; presence may be acceptable, but must check whether the code assumes C99 semantics or uses a platform-specific variant (some platforms provide snprintf as an extension if building C89).\n- size_t, uint64_t: fundamental types \u2014 uint64_t is from stdint.h (C99). Need their definitions to check whether the code depends on C99 typedefs (which is relevant to MISRA rule about language extensions/allowed language versions).\n- WINDOWS, _WIN32, __CYGWIN__: conditional-compilation macros used to select platform-specific code paths. Their definitions determine whether platform-specific constructs (e.g., different mkdir semantics, different write signature casts) are being used; these macros must be known to decide if the differing branches introduce language extensions.\n\nIn short: to determine if the function uses language/compiler extensions we must see the declarations and platform-macro definitions for all externally referenced types, macros, and functions (especially POSIX/OS-specific flags like O_LARGEFILE, system calls, and C99 typedefs) so we can tell whether the code depends on non-ISO-C language or library extensions."
