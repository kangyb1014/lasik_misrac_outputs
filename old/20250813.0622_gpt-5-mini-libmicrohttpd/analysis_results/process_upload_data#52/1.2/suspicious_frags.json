  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "I reviewed the function and related symbols for use of compiler language extensions (examples: GCC/Clang __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, statement-expressions ({...}), nested functions, inline assembler, nameless structs/unions extensions, extended keywords like __extension__, or other documented compiler-specific language features). None are present in the provided code. The code uses standard C constructs: enums, structs, casts, pointer usage, function calls, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef WINDOWS, #if defined(__CYGWIN__) etc.) and standard/Posix library calls (snprintf, open, write, mkdir, strdup, unlink, isprint). Conditional compilation and feature macros (O_LARGEFILE, _WIN32, __CYGWIN__) are platform-specific checks, not compiler language extensions per se. No compiler-specific keywords or nonstandard language constructs were found, so there are no fragments to report for investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
