  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nWhen MHD_DIGEST_HAS_EXT_ERROR is defined but digest_ext_error(da) is implemented as a macro that always evaluates to false (as in the provided code: #define digest_ext_error(da) (false)), the conditional if (digest_ext_error(da)) is never true and the return false; statement can never be executed. That return is therefore dead code\u2014its removal would not affect program behaviour.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified calculate_add_nonce_with_retry code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/594.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry:\n```c\nstatic bool\ncalculate_add_nonce_with_retry (struct MHD_Connection *const connection,\n                                const char *realm,\n                                struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n                                char *nonce)\n{\n  const uint64_t timestamp1 = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\n  const size_t realm_len = strlen (realm);\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (0 == MHD_get_master (connection->daemon)->digest_auth_rand_size)\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Random value was not initialised by \" \\\n                 \"MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_RANDOM or \" \\\n                 \"MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_RANDOM_COPY, generated nonces \" \\\n                 \"are predictable.\\n\"));\n#endif\n\n  if (! calculate_add_nonce (connection, timestamp1, realm, realm_len, da,\n                             nonce))\n  {\n    /* Either:\n     * 1.
