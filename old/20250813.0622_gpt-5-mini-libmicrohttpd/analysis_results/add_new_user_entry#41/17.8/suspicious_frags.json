  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in add_new_user_entry. The pointer parameters are declared as const char *const (username, password, realm), so the pointer itself and the pointed-to characters cannot be changed by this function; there are no assignments to these parameter variables (no statements like username = ..., password = ..., realm = ...). Integer parameters (allow_area_1, allow_area_2) are only read and copied into the entry structure (entry->allow_area_1/2 = allow_area_1/2), not modified. The code only stores copies of the parameter values into the UserEntry fields and passes the parameters by value to helper functions; it does not alter the parameter objects themselves. Therefore there are no fragments that warrant investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
