  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated in this fragment: memcmp takes const void*, boundary is const char*, and &buf[newline+4] is a pointer to a modifiable buffer (buf is later written to with buf[newline] = '\\0'), so buf cannot be const. If instead the buffer were never modified and buf remained declared as plain char * (not const char *), that would be a violation of Rule 8.13 because the pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible."
