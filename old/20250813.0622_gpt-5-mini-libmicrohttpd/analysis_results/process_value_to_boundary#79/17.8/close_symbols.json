  "explanation": "- struct MHD_PostProcessor: required to determine which identifiers in the function are fields of the object pointed to by pp (e.g. buffer_pos, buffer_size, skip_rn, state, dash_state, must_ikvi, ikvi, cls, content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding, value_offset). The MISRA rule allows modification of the object referenced by a pointer parameter but forbids reassignment of the parameter itself; knowing the struct layout confirms that expressions like pp->state = ... modify the pointee (allowed) and not the parameter variable pp.\\n- enum PP_State and enumerators (including PP_Error): needed so the analyzer can recognise assignments to pp->state and values passed as next_state/next_dash_state as enum values and verify that the enum parameters next_state/next_dash_state themselves are not reassigned.\\n- RN_Dash definition: used in pp->skip_rn = RN_Dash; the analyzer must confirm skip_rn is a member of the pointee (allowed modification) and that RN_Dash is not an attempt to modify the parameter.\\n- prototype/type of pp->ikvi: pp->ikvi(...) is a call via a function-pointer member; the prototype lets the analyzer confirm this is a member call (modifies pointee via side-effects if any) and that no parameter variable (pp, ioffptr, boundary, etc.) is being reassigned via this call.\\n- MHD_NO and MHD_YES: return constants used in the function; included so the analyzer can trace return points but they do not affect the parameter-modification rule directly.\\n- MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: symbolic constant passed to pp->ikvi; included for completeness to understand the ikvi call.\\n- memchr and memcmp prototypes (standard <string.h>): these are called with expressions involving local 'buf' and 'boundary'. Having their prototypes allows the analyzer to confirm these standard functions do not modify the function's parameter variables (they operate on buffers passed by pointer but do not reassign caller parameters).\\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any of the function's formal parameters (pp, ioffptr, boundary, blen, next_state, next_dash_state) are being assigned/reassigned inside the function (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
