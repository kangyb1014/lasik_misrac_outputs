  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The lines like (void) cls; (and the similar casts for url and version) are pure no-op expression statements. They are executed when the function runs but have no effect on program state or observable behaviour; removing them would not change the program. That matches the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, so the agent A's report is correct.\n\nNotes/mitigation: these casts are a common idiom to suppress \u201cunused parameter\u201d compiler warnings and are often necessary because the function must match a required callback signature. Under MISRA you must not leave dead code without justification: either avoid the unused parameter (if the API allows it), or document and record a formal deviation/justification for the no-op casts (or use a project-approved mechanism to suppress the warning)."
