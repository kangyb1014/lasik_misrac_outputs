  "explanation": "The agent A\u2019s report is not correct. The expression-statement \u201c(void) url;\u201d is the common, intentional idiom to mark a formal parameter as unused and to suppress compiler warnings; it carries no side\u2011effects but documents intent. While the literal text of Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour, MISRA guidance accepts explicit no\u2011op casts (or other documented idioms) to indicate intentionally unused parameters rather than programming error. In other words, this is not the kind of inadvertent, superfluous code that Rule 2.2 is intended to prohibit. The empty test log simply shows the function was not exercised by the test harness and does not support the claim that the cast is an unlawful dead\u2011code instance. If a tool flags such idioms as violations of Rule 2.2, that finding should be treated as a false positive or handled via an approved justification/deviation or by using a project\u2011wide UNUSED macro or other documented mechanism to indicate intentionally unused parameters."
