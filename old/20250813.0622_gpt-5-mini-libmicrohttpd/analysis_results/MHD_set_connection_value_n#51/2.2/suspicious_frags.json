  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 (dead code) for the following reasons:\n- The function signature and parameter list are declarations/definitions required for linkage and API; they are not executable operations whose removal would be inert.\n- The final return that forwards to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ is the normal control flow and cannot be considered dead without broader call-graph analysis; it performs delegated work and must be preserved.\n- The enum MHD_ValueKind entries are compile-time definitions; they are not executable code and thus not subject to the rule as \"dead code\" (note: the rule applies to executed operations).\n- The comment and the use of strlen guarded by the ternary expressions are part of the conditional already marked above; other isolated tokens (braces, commas, types) are syntactic and not removable without changing program behaviour.\n- Initialization vs assignment: there are no initializations here that would be misclassified as dead code.\nGiven the limited context, the indicated fragments are the only places where an executed operation (the conditional check and its subexpressions) might be present yet effectively removable without changing observable behaviour; all other parts are either non-executable or manifestly necessary for correct control flow."
