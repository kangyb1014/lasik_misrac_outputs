  "explanation": "Only the parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' is a non-const pointer in this function and therefore potentially violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). The call that forwards 'connection' to MHD_set_connection_value_n_nocheck_ is included because it propagates the non-const pointer. Other pointers in the code (key and value) are already const-qualified (const char *), so they do not need investigation for this rule. The use of strlen on key/value is compatible with const char * (strlen accepts const char *). No other pointer declarations or uses are present that would be relevant to Rule 8.13."
