  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following serve_simple_form code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 21.17.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of serve_simple_form.\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nserve_simple_form (const void *cls,\n                   const char *mime,\n                   struct Session *session,\n                   struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  const char *form = cls;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n\n  /* return static form */\n  response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (strlen (form), form);\n  add_session_cookie (session, response);\n  if (MHD_YES !=\n      MHD_add_response_header (response,\n                               MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n                               mime))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr,\n             \"Failed to set content type header!\\n\");\n    /* return response without content type anyway ... */\n  }\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (connection,\n                            MHD_HTTP_OK,\n                            response);\n  MHD_destroy_response (response);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The code calls strlen(form) where form is set from the incoming parameter cls (const void *). If cls does not point to a NUL-terminated char array (for example a buffer with a known length but no terminating '\\0') or is NULL, strlen(form) will read past the bounds of the object (or dereference NULL), causing out-of-bounds access. Thus the call can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 unless the caller can guarantee cls always points to a valid NUL-terminated string (e.g. a string literal or explicitly terminated buffer).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void\nprobe_log_state(const void *cls,\n                const char *mime,\n                struct Session *session,\n                struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                const char *stage)\n{\n  FILE *fp = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/87.txt\", \"a\");\n  if (fp == NULL)\n  {\n    return;\n  }\n  /* Log pointer values and a stage tag so a reproducer can see the control path */\n  fprintf(fp, \"[probe] stage=%s cls=%p mime=%p session=%p connection=%p\\n\",\n          stage, cls, (void *) mime, (void *) session, (void *) connection);\n  /* If cls is NULL, explicitly note that.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The report is correct. The code casts the incoming const void *cls to const char *form and calls strlen(form) with no NULL check and no evidence in this function that form points to a NUL-terminated char array. strlen reads memory until it finds a '\\0', so if cls is NULL this is a NULL dereference, and if cls points to a buffer that is not NUL-terminated strlen can read beyond the object bounds. That behavior is exactly what MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids unless there is a guaranteed contract that the pointer references a NUL-terminated object. The test probe\u2019s empty log does not refute the potential violation \u2014 it only shows the probe did not exercise the function \u2014 it does not make the strlen usage safe.\n\nRemediations: document and enforce a precondition that cls must be a valid NUL-terminated string; or check for NULL and handle it; or change the API to accept an explicit length and avoid strlen (pass known length to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static); or otherwise ensure at compile/run time that strlen cannot read past the object bounds or dereference NULL."
