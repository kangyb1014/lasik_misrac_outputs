  "explanation": "The function print_perf_warnings has the signature (void) and therefore takes no parameters. There are no formal parameters (neither pointer nor non-pointer) in this function to be modified. All assignments in the body (e.g., to the local variable newline_needed) are to local objects, not to function parameters. The calls to fprintf, printf and MHD_is_feature_supported pass arguments but do not represent modifications of this function\u2019s parameters. As a result, there are no code fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 (A function parameter should not be modified)."
