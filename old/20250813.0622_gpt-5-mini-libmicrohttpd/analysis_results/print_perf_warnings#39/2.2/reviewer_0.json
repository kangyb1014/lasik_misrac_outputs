  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following print_perf_warnings code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.2.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of print_perf_warnings.\n```c\nstatic void\nprint_perf_warnings (void)\n{\n  int newline_needed = 0;\n#if defined (_DEBUG)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: Running with debug asserts enabled, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && ! defined (__OPTIMIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled without enabled compiler \"\n           \"optimisations, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined (__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled with size-optimisations, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701\n  if (MHD_NO != MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The libmicrohttpd is compiled with \"\n             \"debug asserts enabled, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n    newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n  }\n#endif /* MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 */\n  if (newline_needed)\n    printf (\"\\n\");\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:In run_mhd(), the branch 'else if (tool_params.select)' contains the expression-statement '(void) flags;'. That statement performs no observable action (flags is a non-volatile int) and can be removed without changing program behaviour, so it is dead code when that branch executes. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log_event(const char *event, int newline_needed)\n{\n  /* Log control-flow and state to a persistent file for repro and evidence. */\n  FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/314.txt\", \"a\");\n  if (f != NULL)\n  {\n    fprintf(f, \"%s newline_needed=%d\\n\", event, newline_needed);\n    fclose(f);\n  }\n}\n\nstatic void\nprint_perf_warnings (void)\n{\n  int newline_needed = 0;\n  probe_log_event(\"enter print_perf_warnings\", newline_needed);\n#if defined (_DEBUG)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: Running with debug asserts enabled, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n  probe_log_event(\"after _DEBUG branch\", newline_needed);\n#endif /* _DEBUG */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && ! defined (__OPTIMIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled without enabled compiler \"\n           \"optimisations, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n  probe_log_event(\"after __GNUC__ && !__OPTIMIZE__ branch\", newline_needed);\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined (__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__)\n  fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The tools is compiled with size-optimisations, \"\n           \"the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n  probe_log_event(\"after __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__ branch\", newline_needed);\n#endif /* __GNUC__ && ! __OPTIMIZE__ */\n#if MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701\n  if (MHD_NO != MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD))\n  {\n    fprintf (stderr, \"WARNING: The libmicrohttpd is compiled with \"\n             \"debug asserts enabled, the performance is suboptimal.\\n\");\n    newline_needed |=  ! 0;\n    probe_log_event(\"inside MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD supported block\", newline_needed);\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    probe_log_event(\"inside MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD unsupported block\", newline_needed);\n  }\n#endif /* MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701 */\n  probe_log_event(\"before final newline check\", newline_needed);\n  if (newline_needed)\n    printf (\"\\n\");\n  probe_log_event(\"exit print_perf_warnings\", newline_needed);\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for print_perf_warnings.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Agent A's scenario cites an expression-statement '(void) flags;' in run_mhd(), but the target code under review is print_perf_warnings and contains no such statement. Rule 2.2 forbids executed operations whose removal does not affect program behaviour. The reported dead-code example ((void)flags;) would indeed be a no-op if applied to a non-volatile object and therefore would meet the textual definition of dead code \u2014 however that statement is not present in the supplied print_perf_warnings function, so it cannot make that function violate Rule 2.2.\n\nMoreover, the operations in print_perf_warnings that might look suspicious (for example newline_needed |= ! 0) are not no-ops: '! 0' yields 1, so those statements set newline_needed and do affect subsequent behaviour (the final conditional printf). Conditional-compilation branches that are not compiled in are not \"dead code\" in the sense used by Rule 2.2; they are simply excluded by the preprocessor. The probe_log_event test produced no logs because the function was not exercised at runtime in the test, not because of a static dead-code violation in print_perf_warnings.\n\nTherefore the claim that print_perf_warnings violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
