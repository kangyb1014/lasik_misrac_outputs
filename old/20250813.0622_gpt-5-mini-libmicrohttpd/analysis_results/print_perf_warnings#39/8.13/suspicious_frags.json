  "explanation": "No pointer declarations or pointer-typed variables appear in the provided function body that could be (re)qualified as pointing to const. Specific items considered and reasons they do not require investigation for Rule 8.13:\n\n- The fprintf/printf calls pass string literals as format arguments. The C standard declares these parameters as const char * (format), so the pointer types used are already const-qualified as required. String literals are immutable and are passed to functions expecting const-qualified pointers.\n\n- The use of stderr: stderr is a standard library object of type FILE * provided by the runtime. Its type is determined by the standard library and not by this code; it is intentionally a non-const FILE * because I/O functions modify FILE state. Making that pointer point to const would be inappropriate.\n\n- The call to MHD_is_feature_supported(MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD) and the comparisons with MHD_NO use macros/APIs that are not pointer declarations in this function. There is no evidence in the presented code that these macros or the function involve pointer types that should be const-qualified.\n\nBecause there are no local or parameter pointer declarations in this function that could be const-qualified, there are no code fragments in this function that need to be investigated for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
