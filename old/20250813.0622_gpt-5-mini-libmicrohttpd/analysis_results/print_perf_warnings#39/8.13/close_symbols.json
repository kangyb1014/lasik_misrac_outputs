  "explanation": "- fprintf, printf: you must inspect their declared parameter types to check whether the format string and stream parameters are const-qualified (format strings should be const char *). Using the actual prototype from <stdio.h> establishes there is no MISRA violation when passing string literals.\n- stderr and FILE: stderr is a FILE *; knowing the FILE type and that fprintf writes to the stream shows the stream pointer is intentionally non-const (it permits modification of FILE state), so it should not be const-qualified.\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: include its prototype to verify whether it takes or returns any pointer types; if it accepted a pointer parameter the const-qualification would need checking. In this function it is called with an enum/macro, but the declaration confirms no pointer constness issues.\n- MHD_NO and MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: their definitions (macro or enum) confirm they are integral constants, not pointers; this rules out pointer-qualification concerns for those arguments/values.\n- MHD_VERSION and compiler macros (__GNUC__, __OPTIMIZE__, __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__): these control which fprintf calls are present in the compiled function. To determine whether any compiled path introduces a pointer that should be const-qualified you must know which conditional branches are active in the build.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether any pointer is passed or used in print_perf_warnings and whether those pointers are declared with or without appropriate const qualification (the core of the MISRA rule under review)."
