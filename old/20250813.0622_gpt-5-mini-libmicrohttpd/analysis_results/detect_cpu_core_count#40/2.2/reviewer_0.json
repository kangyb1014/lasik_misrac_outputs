Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of detect_cpu_core_count.\n```c\nstatic unsigned int\ndetect_cpu_core_count (void)\n{\n  int sys_cpu_count;\n  sys_cpu_count = mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count ();\n  if (0 >= sys_cpu_count)\n  {\n    int proc_cpu_count;\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to detect the number of logical CPU cores \"\n             \"available on the system.\\n\");\n    proc_cpu_count = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count ();\n    if (0 < proc_cpu_count)\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"The number of CPU cores available for this process \"\n               \"is used as a fallback.\\n\");\n      sys_cpu_count = proc_cpu_count;\n    }\n#ifdef MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT\n    if (0 >= sys_cpu_count)\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"configure-detected hardcoded number is used \"\n               \"as a fallback.\\n\");\n      sys_cpu_count = MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT;\n    }\n#endif\n    if (0 >= sys_cpu_count)\n      sys_cpu_count = 1;\n    printf (\"Assuming %d logical CPU core%s on this system.\\n\", sys_cpu_count,\n            (1 == sys_cpu_count) ? \"\" : \"s\");\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    printf (\"Detected %d logical CPU core%s on this system.\\n\", sys_cpu_count,\n            (1 == sys_cpu_count) ? \"\" : \"s\");\n  }\n  return (unsigned int) sys_cpu_count;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The outer conditional `if (1)` is always true and thus redundant: evaluating the condition and performing the branch selection is executed but removing the `if (1)` wrapper (leaving the inner block) would not change program behaviour. The constant-true conditional therefore constitutes dead code (executed code whose removal would not affect behaviour).\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nstatic unsigned int\ndetect_cpu_core_count (void)\n{\n  int sys_cpu_count;\n  sys_cpu_count = mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count ();\n\n  /* Open log file for appending control-flow and state information. */\n  FILE *log = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/322.txt\", \"a\");\n  if (log)\n  {\n    fprintf(log, \"enter detect_cpu_core_count: sys_cpu_count after mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count = %d\\n\",\n            sys_cpu_count);\n  }\n\n  if (0 >= sys_cpu_count)\n  {\n    if (log)\n      fprintf(log, \"branch: sys_cpu_count <= 0 -> entering fallback path\\n\");\n\n    int proc_cpu_count;\n    fprintf (stderr, \"Failed to detect the number of logical CPU cores \"\n             \"available on the system.\\n\");\n    if (log)\n      fprintf(log, \"stderr message emitted: failed to detect system cpu count\\n\");\n\n    proc_cpu_count = mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count ();\n    if (log)\n      fprintf(log, \"proc_cpu_count after mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count = %d\\n\",\n              proc_cpu_count);\n\n    if (0 < proc_cpu_count)\n    {\n      fprintf (stderr, \"The number of CPU cores available for this process \"\n               \"is used as a fallback.\\n\");\n      if (log)\n        fprintf(log, \"proc_cpu_count > 0 -> using proc_cpu_count as fallback: %d\\n\",\n                proc_cpu_count);\n      sys_cpu_count = proc_cpu_count;\n    }\n#ifdef MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT\n    if (0 >= sys_cpu_count)\n    {\n      if (log)\n        fprintf(log, \"sys_cpu_count still <= 0 after proc fallback -> attempting MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT fallback\\n\");\n      fprintf (stderr, \"configure-detected hardcoded number is used \"\n               \"as a fallback.\\n\");\n      sys_cpu_count = MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT;\n      if (log)\n        fprintf(log, \"MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT used: %d\\n\", sys_cpu_count);\n    }\n#endif\n    if (0 >= sys_cpu_count)\n      sys_cpu_count = 1;\n\n    if (log)\n      fprintf(log, \"final sys_cpu_count after fallbacks = %d\\n\", sys_cpu_count);\n\n    printf (\"Assuming %d logical CPU core%s on this system.\\n\", sys_cpu_count,\n            (1 == sys_cpu_count) ? \"\" : \"s\");\n    if (log)\n      fprintf(log, \"printed: Assuming message (sys_cpu_count=%d)\\n\", sys_cpu_count);\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    if (log)\n      fprintf(log, \"branch: sys_cpu_count > 0 -> detected path (sys_cpu_count=%d)\\n\",\n              sys_cpu_count);\n\n    printf (\"Detected %d logical CPU core%s on this system.\\n\", sys_cpu_count,\n            (1 == sys_cpu_count) ? \"\" : \"s\");\n    if (log)\n      fprintf(log, \"printed: Detected message (sys_cpu_count=%d)\\n\", sys_cpu_count);\n  }\n\n  if (log)\n  {\n    fprintf(log, \"returning sys_cpu_count = %d\\n\\n\", sys_cpu_count);\n    fclose(log);\n  }\n\n  return (unsigned int) sys_cpu_count;\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for detect_cpu_core_count.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The provided detect_cpu_core_count implementation contains no outer \u201cif (1)\u201d or any other constant-true conditional as claimed by agent A. All branches in the function are controlled by runtime values (sys_cpu_count, proc_cpu_count) or by conditional compilation (#ifdef MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT). MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 concerns executed but removable code; unreachable code or code excluded by preprocessing is not automatically a Rule 2.2 violation. The empty test log only indicates the function may not have been exercised by the test run \u2014 that is a test-coverage issue, not evidence of dead code in the source. (If there actually were an executed constant-true if-wrapper whose removal would not change behaviour, that wrapper would match the Rule 2.2 definition of dead code, but no such construct appears in the submitted source.)"
