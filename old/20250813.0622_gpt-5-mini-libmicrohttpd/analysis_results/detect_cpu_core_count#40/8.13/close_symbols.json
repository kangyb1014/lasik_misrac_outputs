  "explanation": "- mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count: need the function prototype/definition to confirm its return type and that it does not return or take any pointer(s). If it returned a pointer to non-const data that is used here the MISRA pointer-to-const rule could be implicated; if it is int(void) (as expected) it does not affect the rule.\n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count: same rationale as above (confirm it is int(void) and does not introduce pointer usage).\n- MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT: the macro/value must be known (integer constant vs pointer). If it were a pointer or expression involving pointers the pointer-to-const rule could apply; if it is an int constant it does not.\n- fprintf: need the prototype (int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)) to confirm that the format parameter is const char * and that the stream parameter is FILE *. This confirms whether passing the string literals and stderr is compatible with const qualifications.\n- printf: need the prototype (int printf(const char *format, ...)) for the same reason as fprintf (format parameter is const char *).\n- stderr: declaration (extern FILE *stderr) and its mutability. Since stderr is a FILE * (stateful stream), it is expected to be non-const; this justifies why a non-const pointer is used and is acceptable under the MISRA guideline (pointer-to-const when possible \u2014 not possible if the object is mutable and API needs to modify it).\n- FILE (stdio FILE type): need the definition/description of the FILE type to determine whether the stream object is inherently mutable (so a non-const FILE * is required) and to justify that making stderr a pointer-to-const would be inappropriate.\n- format string literals (string-literals used as printf/fprintf format): string literals are used as the format arguments. Their effective type and the prototypes above must be considered to ensure no pointer-to-non-const violation (standard prototypes take const char *, so passing string literals is compatible).\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst verify whether any pointer is passed or returned by the target function (or by the functions it calls) and whether those pointers should or could be const-qualified under the MISRA rule. They also allow checking that use of stderr and format string literals is consistent with the rule (stderr is mutable FILE *, format strings are passed to parameters declared const char *)."
