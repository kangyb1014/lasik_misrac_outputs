  "scenario": "The single statement strm->next_out = tmp does not itself call any <string.h> functions and therefore does not by itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, in the surrounding code tmp is used as the output buffer for deflate and later as the source for memcpy(tmp, have). If tmp does not point to at least CHUNK bytes (or otherwise is smaller than the maximum number of bytes deflate can write into it or than the value 'have'), then deflate may write beyond tmp and the subsequent memcpy(((uint8_t *)(*dest)) + ((*dest_size) - have), tmp, have) would access beyond the bounds of tmp \u2014 this would violate Rule 21.17."
