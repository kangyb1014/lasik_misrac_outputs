  "scenario": "The assignment itself does not call any <string.h> functions and therefore does not directly violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, a specific violation scenario is: if 'tmp' points to a buffer smaller than CHUNK, setting strm->avail_out = CHUNK allows deflate() to write up to CHUNK bytes into tmp; subsequently memcpy(tmp -> dest, have) will read 'have' bytes from tmp and may access beyond tmp's bounds, causing an out-of-bounds access (and thus a Rule 21.17 violation). Fix: ensure tmp is at least CHUNK bytes long or set avail_out to the actual tmp buffer size."
