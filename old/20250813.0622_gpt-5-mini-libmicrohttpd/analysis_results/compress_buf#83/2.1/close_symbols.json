  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for unreachable-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- CHUNK\n  - The loop bounds and the inner loop condition (avail_out == 0) depend on CHUNK. If CHUNK == 0 or has an unexpected value the loops' termination/iteration behaviour may change (making code infinite/unreachable or trivially reachable). You must know CHUNK's value/definition to decide reachability of loop bodies and subsequent statements.\n\n- Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_OK\n  - The outer loop continuation and the value of 'flush' use these macros/constants. If any of these are equal or have unexpected values the control-flow (do/while) may collapse into always/never looping. Z_OK is used to map deflate return to ret; its exact value and relation to deflate's return values is needed to determine which return paths are feasible.\n\n- deflate (zlib) \u2014 prototype and formal semantics\n  - The inner loop repetition condition depends on the effect of deflate on strm->avail_out and its return values. To determine whether the inner do/while may iterate zero, one or many times (and whether some code after the loop is reachable) you need deflate's documented behavior: when it can fill the output (avail_out==0), whether it can fail or block forever, and the possible return codes.\n\n- struct z_stream (definition: fields avail_in, avail_out, next_in, next_out and their types)\n  - The code reads/writes strm->avail_in/avail_out and sets next_in/next_out; reachability of loops depends on these fields' types (signedness, size) and semantics. You must know whether these fields can hold values that make comparisons in the loop conditions true/false and how deflate manipulates them.\n\n- uInt and Bytef typedefs\n  - The cast and assignment to strm->avail_in and next_in involve uInt/Bytef types; type ranges/aliases (e.g., if uInt is 16-bit and CHUNK exceeds it) could truncate values and change control flow, producing unreachable or infinite paths.\n\n- enum MHD_Result and its enumerators (MHD_YES, MHD_NO)\n  - The function returns values of this enum; to check whether some return statements or later code are reachable (or dead because a different return is always taken) you need the enum and mapping to values used by callers and analysis expectations.\n\n- read_cb and any sites that register/call read_cb (callers up the chain)\n  - To decide whether compress_buf itself is unreachable at project scope you must know whether its caller (read_cb) is ever invoked (direct callers or callback registration). Static call graph showed read_cb as the only caller; if read_cb is never reachable/registered, compress_buf is unreachable. Therefore include read_cb and any registration/usage sites that may make it reachable.\n\n(Notes: standard libc functions used here \u2014 realloc, free, memcpy \u2014 do not change control-flow invariants relevant to \"unreachable code\" beyond their documented failure behavior (realloc returning NULL causes an early return). If deeper analysis of allocation failure paths is needed, their standard semantics are already sufficient.)"
