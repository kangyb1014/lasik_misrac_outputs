  "explanation": "Other parts of the function are platform-API usage or standard C constructs and do not, by themselves, represent compiler language extensions that must be reported for MISRA C Rule 1.2. Examples: the use of platform types (HMODULE, DWORD, SYSTEM_INFO, cpuset_t, struct pst_dynamic) and calls to OS/library functions (LoadLibraryA, FreeLibrary, GetSystemInfo, pstat_getdynamic, vxCpuEnabledGet, etc.) are API/OS-specific but not language extensions. Standard casts to (void *) for data-pointer usage, memset calls, preprocessor conditionals (#ifdef/#if), the for-loop used to count set bits, and integer conversions/casts are standard C behavior (though portability or correctness may still need review, they are not compiler language extensions per se). The fragments selected are the places where compiler-specific calling-convention macros (WINAPI) and casting of the result of GetProcAddress through (void *) to function-pointer types appear; these are commonly implemented as compiler extensions and therefore need investigation under Rule 1.2."
