  "explanation": "Only uses of string.h functions need investigation for Rule 21.17. The two memcpy calls above are the only string.h calls in this function and therefore must be checked for potential out-of-bounds accesses. Other fragments in the function need not be investigated for this rule because they are guarded or constrained as follows:\n\n- The branch that copies from response->data computes data_write_offset from rsp_write_position - data_start and asserts response->data_size >= data_write_offset and SSIZE_MAX >= (response->data_size - data_write_offset). ret is assigned (response->data_size - data_write_offset) and then reduced to size_to_fill if larger, so the length passed to memcpy is bounded by the actual remaining data and by size_to_fill.\n\n- size_to_fill is computed from connection->write_buffer_size minus max_chunk_overhead and further limited by max_chunk; earlier code ensures connection->write_buffer_size > max_chunk_overhead via mhd_assert, and size_to_fill is used to bound callback returns. The code checks for ret > size_to_fill and treats that as an error path, preventing an oversized copy.\n\n- For the memcpy of chunk_hdr, chunk_hdr_len is produced by MHD_uint32_to_strx and asserted non-zero and less than sizeof(chunk_hdr). The computed connection->write_buffer_send_offset = (max_chunk_hdr_len - (chunk_hdr_len + 2)) results in the eventual write range (send_offset .. send_offset + chunk_hdr_len - 1) ending at max_chunk_hdr_len - 3 + chunk_hdr_len + 1 = sizeof(chunk_hdr) and the code has earlier assertions ensuring the write buffer is large enough (max_chunk_overhead < connection->write_buffer_size). These constraints bound the destination range for the memcpy.\n\n- Writes that set CRLF bytes and the final buffer append offset use the same size calculations and the earlier bounds checks (including limiting ret and size_to_fill) to ensure indices written (max_chunk_hdr_len + (size_t)ret + 1 at most) do not exceed connection->write_buffer_size-1.\n\nBecause only the two memcpy calls invoke <string.h> functions, and the surrounding code contains explicit bounds checks and assertions that constrain their arguments, no other fragments need to be reported for Rule 21.17."
