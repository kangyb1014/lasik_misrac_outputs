  "explanation": "The claim is not supported by the provided code. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations (the type a pointer points to should be const-qualified when possible). The snippet of try_ready_chunked_body only calls MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace; it does not declare that function's prototype. A violation of 8.13 would be in the declaration/definition of MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (or any other function) if those functions accept pointer parameters that are only read but are declared without const. The call-site in try_ready_chunked_body itself does not constitute a Rule 8.13 violation. To confirm a real violation you must inspect the prototype/definition of MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace (and any helpers like mp_ptr_diff_) \u2014 if those functions indeed take non-const pointer parameters but never modify the pointees, then their declarations should be changed to use const and that change (not the call site) would resolve the MISRA concern. In summary: based on the provided code and logs there is no concrete evidence that try_ready_chunked_body violates Rule 8.13; the potential issue would be in the helper function declarations which are not shown."
