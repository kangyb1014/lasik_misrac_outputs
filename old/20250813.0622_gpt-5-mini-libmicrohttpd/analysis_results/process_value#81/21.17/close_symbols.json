  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA <string.h> bounds analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: process_value indexes and copies into fields of this struct (pp->xbuf, pp->xbuf_pos, pp->value_offset, pp->must_ikvi, pp->ikvi). You need the full struct definition to know the types, sizes and alignment of these fields (in particular the declaration of pp->xbuf and its array size).\n\n- pp->xbuf (array) size: Several memcpy/memmove calls use sizeof(pp->xbuf) or copy into pp->xbuf; to decide whether any memcpy/memmove can write out of bounds you must know the exact length (number of elements) of pp->xbuf.\n\n- pp->xbuf_pos: The code uses pp->xbuf_pos for sizes and as a source length in memcpy. Its type and valid range matter to determine whether memcpy lengths can exceed destination buffers.\n\n- pp->value_offset: Used as an offset passed to the ikvi callback and updated by xoff. Knowing its type (size_t) and semantics helps reason about arithmetic and whether any pointer arithmetic or size computations overflow.\n\n- pp->must_ikvi: Controls branching that affects whether buffers are passed to ikvi; needed to reason about whether copies/processing occur in particular branches.\n\n- pp->ikvi (callback prototype): The code passes pointers/lengths (key pointer &pp[1], xbuf, xoff) into this callback; to ensure no out-of-bounds issues you need the prototype/type of ikvi (argument types and whether it may modify buffers). Also to know whether ikvi could be called with invalid pointers created by the code.\n\n- XBUF_SIZE: Local buffer xbuf is declared as char xbuf[XBUF_SIZE + 1]; XBUF_SIZE determines all bounds checks and truncation logic (delta limiting, comparisons to XBUF_SIZE, xoff limits). Precise numerical value or definition is required to prove memcpy/memmove sizes stay within bounds.\n\n- post_process_urlencoded: process_value is called from post_process_urlencoded (call graph). The caller sets value_start, value_end, last_escape. To determine whether pointer arithmetic like (value_end - last_escape) and memcpy from value_start of length delta are valid, you need the caller contract/implementation: what buffer value_start/value_end point into, their relative ordering, and lifetimes. The mhd_asserts are not sufficient if they compile out.\n\n- mhd_assert: The code relies on many mhd_assert checks (e.g., pp->xbuf_pos < sizeof(xbuf), relationships among value_start/value_end/last_escape). To know whether these are enforceable invariants at runtime or are compiled out in production (and therefore cannot be relied upon for safety), you need the macro definition/semantics.\n\n- MHD_unescape_plus: Called with xbuf and may modify the buffer in-place. To reason whether subsequent use of xbuf and xoff is safe (no writes past xbuf size), you must know its exact behavior: does it modify length, does it write only within the buffer provided, and does it rely on a NUL terminator in place (the code NUL-terminates before calling it).\n\n- MHD_http_unescape: Returns xoff = MHD_http_unescape(xbuf); its return determines how much of xbuf is subsequently accessed and passed to memcpy/memmove. You must know its semantics (in-place decode, maximum output length relative to input length, whether it can write beyond the original buffer) to prove no out-of-bounds accesses after unescape.\n\n- memcpy: Standard function used repeatedly. For each call you must verify the source and destination ranges and the length argument are within the actual object bounds. Include the standard semantics (no overlap allowed, behavior on out-of-bounds) in the analysis.\n\n- memmove: Used near the end to shift a small remainder; memmove allows overlap but you must verify source, destination and length are within the object bounds. Its semantics are required to validate that the memmove call cannot access out-of-range memory.\n\n- size_t / bool typedefs: Several arithmetic and comparisons use size_t and bool. Knowing their widths and signedness (size_t unsigned) is necessary when reasoning about expressions like (value_end - last_escape), conversions and comparisons to XBUF_SIZE, and to exclude underflow/overflow scenarios.\n\n(Notes: MHD_str_pct_decode_in_place_lenient_ is an internal used by MHD_http_unescape; you only need it if MHD_http_unescape's contract is not documented. If the unescape functions' behavior is unknown from their prototypes, include their implementations or internal helpers.)"
