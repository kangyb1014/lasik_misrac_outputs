  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Connection: The parameter con has type 'struct MHD_Connection *'. To decide whether this pointer could/should be 'const struct MHD_Connection *' (MISRA: pointer-to-const when possible) we must inspect the type definition to see if there are any reasons it cannot be const (e.g. embedded mutable semantics, macros, or aliasing contracts).\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: The code compares upg_header (const char *) against WS_UPGRADE_VALUE via strcmp. If WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is defined as a non-const char * (or as an array without const), that could indicate a missing const qualification that the rule targets; we need the symbol/type/definition to judge whether it should be const char *.\n- strcmp (prototype): The standard prototype is strcmp(const char *, const char *). Confirming the prototype ensures the function parameters are const-correct and that no implicit declaration alters const expectations in this translation unit.\n- strstr (prototype): Same rationale as strcmp \u2014 strstr has prototype strstr(const char *, const char *). Confirming its declared signature ensures the const-correctness of usage.\n- ahc_cb (caller signature/source): is_websocket_request is static and only called from ahc_cb. To determine whether making con a pointer-to-const is compatible with the surrounding code (and whether the caller relies on passing a non-const pointer or expects modification semantics), inspect the caller call-site(s) and signature. This determines if changing the parameter to point-to-const is actually permissible and does not violate external usage.\n\nThese symbols suffice to determine whether any pointer in the target function (notably the unused 'con' parameter and WS_UPGRADE_VALUE) should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
