  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function parameter upg_header is declared as const char * and strcmp expects const char * for both arguments. WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is a string literal (macro \"websocket\"), which can be passed to a const char * parameter. Therefore the pointer arguments are effectively const-qualified and Rule 8.13 is not violated. (A violation would occur if a non-const pointer variable were passed instead, e.g. a char * variable used where const char * could be used.)"
