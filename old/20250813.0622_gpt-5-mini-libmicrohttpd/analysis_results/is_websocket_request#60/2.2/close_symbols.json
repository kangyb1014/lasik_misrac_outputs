Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "ahc_cb: The caller of is_websocket_request \u2014 you must inspect ahc_cb to see how the return value is used (branching, side-effects, whether the call is redundant). Determining dead code requires the calling context (is the call observable or can it be removed without changing behaviour?).\n\nMHD_lookup_connection_value / MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: These functions (used by ahc_cb) supply the upg_header and con_header arguments passed into is_websocket_request. You must know whether they can return NULL or particular string values; if they always produce values that make the function's conditional constant, the body might be dead.\n\nWS_UPGRADE_VALUE: The constant compared against upg_header via strcmp. If WS_UPGRADE_VALUE has a value that makes the strcmp result predictable (e.g. impossible to match), the conditional in is_websocket_request could be constant; its definition is required to determine that.\n\nstrcmp: The string-compare semantics determine how the upg_header vs WS_UPGRADE_VALUE comparison behaves; understanding whether strcmp could be overridden or replaced (e.g. macro/wrapper) and its normal behaviour is needed to evaluate whether the comparison can be removed safely.\n\nstrstr: Used to test for \"Upgrade\" in con_header. You must confirm its semantics (and whether it could be instrumented/overridden) and whether con_header content from the caller makes this test always true/false.\n\nMHD_YES / MHD_NO: The enum result values returned by the function. You must see how the caller uses these specific enum values; if the caller ignores the result or treats both values equivalently, the function body may be removable. Knowing their definitions (and any side-effects associated with using them) is necessary to judge dead code.\n\n(Notes: struct MHD_Connection and the literal \"Upgrade\" string are not strictly required beyond the above symbols \u2014 con is explicitly unused in the function; the literal is present in source. The listed symbols provide the minimal context to decide if the function's executed operations (the comparisons and returns) are actually observable or removable.)"
