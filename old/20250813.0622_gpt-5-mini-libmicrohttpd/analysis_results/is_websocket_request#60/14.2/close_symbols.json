Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed for MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' analysis of is_websocket_request:\n\n- strcmp: Called directly by is_websocket_request. Although the target function contains no for statement, MISRA requires that the behaviour of functions called within a for-loop be considered part of the loop body. If a caller invokes is_websocket_request inside a for loop, the implementation and side-effects of strcmp must be known to check that the loop\u2019s clauses have no persistent side-effects or unexpected modifications.\n\n- strstr: Same rationale as strcmp \u2014 called by is_websocket_request; its behaviour (including any side-effects or loops in its implementation) must be considered when is_websocket_request is executed from within any for loop.\n\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: Macro/string constant compared by strcmp. Knowing its definition confirms that the comparison in the expression is pure (no side-effects) and cannot affect loop counters or other objects used in for clauses.\n\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO: Enumerators returned by is_websocket_request. Their definitions are needed to confirm the function has no hidden side-effects via return (e.g., if macros involve function-like behaviour) and to fully understand value usage in caller loop conditions.\n\n- enum MHD_Result: Return type declaration is required to ensure no hidden side-effects or complex return semantics that could modify objects used as loop counters in a caller\u2019s for statement.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: Parameter type (even though unused in the function body) \u2014 must be known in case callers pass objects that are modified in the caller\u2019s loop body or shared with loop counters; also to confirm (void)con is indeed a pure discard.\n\n- ahc_cb: The direct caller of is_websocket_request (from the static call graph). Crucial to inspect because ahc_cb may invoke is_websocket_request inside a for loop; MISRA requires checking the for loop clauses in the caller and the behaviour of any called functions (including is_websocket_request) as part of the loop body.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value, send_chat_page, send_bad_request, send_upgrade_required, MHD_lookup_connection_value_n, ws_get_accept_value, MHD_create_response_for_upgrade, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_destroy_response, MHD_queue_response: These are callees of ahc_cb (per the call graph). To fully verify well-formedness of any for loops inside ahc_cb, you must inspect any functions ahc_cb calls from within those loops \u2014 they become part of the loop body. Each listed function must be reviewed for side-effects (modifying loop counter or other objects used in for clauses) or for containing loops that could interact with the caller\u2019s loop control.\n\nIn short: strcmp, strstr, WS_UPGRADE_VALUE, return/type symbols and the caller ahc_cb (plus ahc_cb\u2019s callees) are required to determine whether any for loop that encloses calls to is_websocket_request (or loops within the called functions) is well-formed under the MISRA rule."
