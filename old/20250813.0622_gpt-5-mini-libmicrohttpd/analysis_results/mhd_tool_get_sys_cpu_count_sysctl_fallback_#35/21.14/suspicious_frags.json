  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the supplied function. The code performs integer initialization and checks, sizeof evaluations, and calls sysctlbyname/sysctl with integer buffers. There are no calls to memcmp, no explicit character-buffer comparisons, and no comparisons of null-terminated strings using memory-comparison functions. The only string literal present (\"hw.ncpu\") is passed as an argument to sysctlbyname, not compared with other strings. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that could violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings)."
