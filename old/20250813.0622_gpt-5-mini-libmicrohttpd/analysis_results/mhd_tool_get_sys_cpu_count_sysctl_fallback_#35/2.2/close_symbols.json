  "explanation": "__linux__: Controls whether the entire sysctl-based body is excluded on Linux \u2014 needed to decide if the code is compiled (and therefore potentially dead or live).\nHAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME: Controls inclusion of the sysctlbyname() branch \u2014 needed to determine if that block is compiled and executable.\nHAVE_SYSCTL: Controls inclusion of the sysctl() branch \u2014 needed to determine if that block is compiled and executable.\nHAS_DECL_CTL_HW, HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU: Control use of CTL_HW / HW_NCPU MIB path and compilation of the sysctl() path \u2014 affect whether code is present.\nsysctlbyname: The runtime behavior and return semantics determine whether the statements that assign or reset ret are effective; needed to tell if those calls make the code necessary or if their removal would not change behaviour.\nsysctl: Same as sysctlbyname \u2014 needed to reason about whether the sysctl() call can change ret and thus whether surrounding code is meaningful.\nCTL_HW, HW_NCPU: MIB identifiers used to call sysctl(); their presence/values affect whether the sysctl path is compiled/used.\nmhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count: The direct caller \u2014 to determine whether this function is reachable/used and whether removing or altering it would affect program behaviour.\ndetect_cpu_core_count: The higher-level caller (calls mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count) \u2014 required to decide whether the whole call chain is exercised and if removing this fallback changes overall behaviour.\nmhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_, mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysconf_fallback_: Other alternative methods invoked by mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count (from the static call graph). They are needed to determine whether this sysctl_fallback is ever used in practice (e.g., if earlier methods always succeed then the fallback is dead in effect) and thus whether the fallback code is dead.\n\nRationale: Determination of \"dead code\" for this function depends primarily on compile-time configuration (which blocks are compiled-in) and runtime call/use patterns from its callers and sibling fallback implementations. The listed preprocessor macros, OS/ABI symbols, sysctl APIs, and the caller/callee functions are the minimal set of symbols required to decide whether parts or all of this function are redundant (i.e., executed but removable without changing program behaviour)."
