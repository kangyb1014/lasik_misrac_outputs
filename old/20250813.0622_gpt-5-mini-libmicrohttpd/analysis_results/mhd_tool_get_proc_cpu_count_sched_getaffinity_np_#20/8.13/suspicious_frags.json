  "explanation": "Only cpuset_ptr is a pointer in this function and is used throughout for creation, for passing to sched_getaffinity_np (which writes/fills the cpuset), for size/inspection calls (cpuset_size, cpuset_isset) and for destruction. Those cpuset-related fragments are the only places where const-qualification of a pointer type could be relevant and therefore should be investigated. No other pointer variables are declared or used in this function. Other identifiers (ret, cpu_num, res, max_num, sc_value) are non-pointer scalars and need not be considered for Rule 8.13. Note: sched_getaffinity_np appears to modify the cpuset, so the pointer cannot be const for that call; the investigation should verify whether a separate const-qualified pointer could/should be used for the read-only uses (cpuset_size, cpuset_isset) or whether the APIs themselves should accept const-qualified pointers."
