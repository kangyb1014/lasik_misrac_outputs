  "explanation": "The selected fragments are those most likely to hide unreachable/unsafe paths: checks that rely on integer wrap-around detection, the in-place resize branch with its nested return, the unconditional return for the shrinking case, and the memcpy block that assumes old != NULL when old_size != 0. These deserve investigation because their reachability depends on integer overflow/wrap behaviour or on an assertion (mhd_assert) that is defined as a no-op in the provided configuration.\n\nOther parts of the function need not be investigated for unreachable-code under MISRA 2.1 for the following reasons: pointer arithmetic and use of 'old' occur only inside the explicit guard 'if (NULL != old)', so those uses are reachable and correctly conditioned; the various mhd_assert(...) and _MHD_POISON_MEMORY/_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY macros are defined as no-ops here \u2014 they do not change control flow (they do not produce unreachable code themselves); the remaining conditional branches and returns are reachable depending on runtime values (pos/end/size) and are not statically impossible given the available definitions. Therefore the investigation should focus on the flagged fragments that depend on wrap/overflow detection or on an assertion that is effectively disabled."
