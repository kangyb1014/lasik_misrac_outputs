  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 because the function contains explicit checks and control flow that ensure the string.h calls above are the only potential locations for out-of-bounds accesses: - The code computes asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(new_size) and immediately checks (asize == 0 && new_size != 0) and (asize > pool->end - pool->pos) to ensure the new allocation fits in the pool before assigning new_blc and increasing pool->pos, preventing overflow of the destination of the memcpy. - The path that reaches the memcpy is taken only when either old == NULL or not shrinking (old_size <= new_size). Shrinking cases that could make old_size > new_size are handled earlier (either resized in-place or returned), so copying old_size bytes into the newly allocated block cannot exceed the requested new_size. - The memset that zeros the freed part uses old_size - new_size and is executed only when shrinking (old_size > new_size), so the computed length is positive; pointer arithmetic (old + new_size) is validated by earlier assertions/conditions that ensure the old block lies within the pool bounds. - The final memset(old, 0, old_size) is invoked only when old_size != 0 and the earlier assertions/checks and pool bookkeeping guarantee the old block size and pointer are consistent with the pool memory layout. - Other macros/functions (_MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY, _MHD_POISON_MEMORY, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE, and the various mhd_assert checks) and the runtime checks around pool->pos/pool->end constrain sizes and offsets so there are no other uses of string.h functions in the function that could access beyond object bounds. Therefore, the three explicit string.h usages listed above are the relevant fragments that require investigation for compliance with Rule 21.17."
