  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments found. Reasoning: every statement in the function is potentially reachable depending on inputs \u2014 the function consists only of a sequence of conditional checks that return false when true, followed by a final return that is reached only when none of the earlier conditions trigger. There are no unconditional returns that leave subsequent code unreachable, no constant expressions that always evaluate the same way, no always-false/always-true branches, and no dead branches or code after infinite loops. The memchr() calls are reachable whenever the corresponding length checks pass (header_len and content_len are non-zero). The final call to MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_() is reachable when none of the earlier guards return; thus there is no unreachable code to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n\nNote: Although not related to Rule 2.1, the code does not check header or content pointers for NULL before calling memchr(), which could lead to undefined behavior if a NULL pointer is passed with a non-zero length. That issue is not classified as unreachable code and therefore is not included in the suspicious_frags list."
