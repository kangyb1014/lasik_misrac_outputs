Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "For determining compliance with the MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops you must consider any for loops that appear directly in the target or inside any called functions or macros (the rule counts the behaviour of functions called from a loop body). Although MHD_pool_create contains no explicit for statement, several macros or called routines used here could expand to or call code that contains for loops. Each listed symbol is therefore required so the analyser can see whether any for loops exist and whether they obey the three\u2011clause/one counter constraints:\n\n- struct MemoryPool (full definition): needed to inspect any inlined or macro code that manipulates pool members (pool->memory, pos, end, size, is_mmap). If any macro/function iterates over pool members it may introduce for loops that must be checked.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro or function): often a macro that can expand to logging/assertion code; a macro expansion could contain loops (or call other functions that do). Must inspect its definition to rule out hidden for loops or side effects that interact with loop counters.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN (macro or function): macro could be more than arithmetic (possible implementation uses loops or other statements). Must inspect source to ensure it does not introduce for loops or modify objects used as loop counters.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY (macro or function): very likely to write/fill memory and commonly implemented with loops (e.g. for/while filling bytes). This is the highest\u2011risk symbol: if it contains a for loop, that loop is considered part of MHD_pool_create for MISRA analysis and must be checked for well\u2011formedness (loop counter usage, side effects, etc.).\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_ (object): value affects the control flow (whether mmap/VirtualAlloc path taken). Knowing its value/definition and type is necessary to determine which code is compiled/executed and thus which macros/functions need inspection.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE (macro/constant): used in alignment assertion; its definition may reveal macro expansion or arithmetic that could hide iteration; include to be safe.\n\n- MAP_FAILED (macro/constant): sentinel used in control flow. Inspecting its definition ensures it is not a macro that expands to expressions with side effects or hidden loops.\n\n- malloc, free, mmap, VirtualAlloc (declarations): these calls are invoked from MHD_pool_create. Although standard library/syscalls normally are treated as black\u2011box, their implementations could contain loops. At minimum the declarations let the analyser know these are external allocation routines and whether any of them are macros or inline wrappers in the project (which might contain for loops). If project provides wrappers with loops, they must be examined.\n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS and _WIN32 (preprocessor symbols): the compilation path taken depends on these. To know which code (and therefore which macros/functions) must be inspected for for\u2011loops you must know how these are defined for the build under analysis.\n\nNote: the list is intentionally minimal and focuses on symbols that could hide for loops (macros, inlines, or project wrapper functions) or affect which code path is compiled. Standard library/system calls are included only to determine whether they are simple external calls or project wrappers; if they are pure library calls with no project inline definitions, they can be treated as not introducing MISRA\u2011relevant for loops."
