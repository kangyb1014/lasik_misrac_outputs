  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule (no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings):\n\n- struct MemoryPool\n  - The function allocates and initializes fields of this structure (memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size). Its definition may include inline helper functions or macros (or initializer code elsewhere) that could use memcmp to compare strings. The analyzer must inspect the full type and any associated inline functions/macros.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - This macro/function is invoked in the function. Its implementation could contain diagnostics or helper code that uses memcmp on strings. The analyzer must inspect it to ensure it does not perform forbidden memcmp-based string comparisons.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_\n  - A global variable referenced to choose allocation strategy. Its accessor or any wrapper around it might be implemented in another translation unit that could use memcmp; also it affects code paths taken (mmap vs malloc), so the analyzer must know its value/usage to determine which code path to inspect.\n\n- MAP_FAILED\n  - Macro/constant used to detect mmap/VirtualAlloc failure. Its definition is simple, but it controls the branch that falls back to malloc; the analyzer must follow both branches to check for memcmp use in code reachable from either branch.\n\n- mmap\n  - The call to mmap (or any wrapper) could be a macro/wrapper that invokes library code; its implementation or wrapper may include helper code using memcmp, or could be replaced by project-specific wrappers \u2014 so it must be inspected.\n\n- VirtualAlloc\n  - On Windows builds this API is used; project wrappers around it could include additional logic. The analyzer must inspect its usage/implementation to ensure no memcmp-on-strings occurs there.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN\n  - Macro or function used to compute alloc_size for the malloc fallback. Its definition could contain memory operations or helper routines that might use memcmp on strings; must be inspected.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE\n  - Macro used in an assertion involving pointer alignment. Its definition could be a macro or constant that references other macros/functions that might use memcmp; include to inspect related macros and ensure no memcmp usage.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY\n  - This macro/function is called on the newly allocated memory. It is a primary candidate for containing memcmp (though typically it writes a pattern, it could perform checks). The analyzer must inspect its implementation to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- malloc\n  - Standard allocator is called. If the project provides a replacement wrapper for malloc (macro or function alias), that wrapper might include string comparison logic. The analyzer should confirm whether malloc is the standard one or a project-specific wrapper that could use memcmp inappropriately.\n\n- free\n  - free is called on error paths. As with malloc, if free is wrapped by project code the wrapper might contain additional logic; include to inspect for any memcmp uses.\n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS and _WIN32 (preprocessor symbols)\n  - These conditional compilation symbols determine which allocation branch (mmap/VirtualAlloc vs malloc) is compiled. The analyzer must consider both configurations: code compiled with MAP_ANONYMOUS/_WIN32 defined and not defined. That ensures inspection of all reachable code paths for any occurrence of memcmp used on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nNotes:\n- The target function itself does not call memcmp, but some of the listed symbols (notably _MHD_POISON_MEMORY, any wrappers for mmap/VirtualAlloc/malloc/free, or inline helpers in struct MemoryPool or assertion macros) could contain memcmp usage. The analyzer should inspect the definitions/implementations of these symbols (and any macros they expand to) to prove no memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings in any code reachable from MHD_pool_create under any relevant build configuration."
