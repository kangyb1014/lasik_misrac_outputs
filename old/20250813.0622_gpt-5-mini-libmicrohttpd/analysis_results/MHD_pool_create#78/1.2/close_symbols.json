  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule on use of language/compiler extensions you must inspect the definitions/expansions and conditional compilation that affect MHD_pool_create. The listed symbols are required because:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: its field types (memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size) and any embedded macros/attributes could hide extensions (e.g. packed/aligned attributes, bitfields, nonstandard types).\n- mhd_assert: usually a macro; its expansion may use compiler builtins (__builtin_expect, __builtin_unreachable), attributes, or other extensions. Need to see its definition.\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: macro or function used here; its implementation may use inline assembly, statement-expressions, or compiler-specific intrinsics\u2014must inspect.\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN and ALIGN_SIZE: macros used to compute sizes and alignment; their implementations often use trick macros or GCC extensions (statement expressions, typeof, __extension__) \u2014 must inspect for extensions.\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: symbol used in compile-time logic and arithmetic; its definition could be a macro or inline function that uses extensions.\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS and _WIN32: compile-time feature-test macros that determine which code path is compiled. To know whether any extension-using code is active you must know which of these are defined in the build environment.\n- MAP_FAILED, mmap, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE: system constants/macros and the mmap function; MAP_FAILED or related macros could be implemented as casts or constructs that use extensions; mmap may be a wrapper macro that expands to builtin or extension on some platforms\u2014inspect definitions.\n- VirtualAlloc, MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE: Win32 API symbols; wrappers or compatibility macros could hide compiler-specific extensions. Also necessary to determine which platform-specific path is in use.\n- malloc, free: standard library functions; they are usually straightforward, but platform-specific wrappers/macros or attributes (e.g., __attribute__((malloc))) could be present\u2014inspect if any nonstandard extensions are applied in this codebase.\n- uintptr_t: typedef used in a cast; its definition comes from stdint.h but could be redefined or provided via compiler extensions in some environments; check to ensure no nonstandard usage.\n\nExamining these definitions (and the build defines that set _WIN32 / MAP_ANONYMOUS) allows detection of any hidden use of compiler-specific language extensions (GCC builtins, __attribute__, inline asm, statement-expressions, __extension__, etc.) that would violate the MISRA prohibition on language extensions."
