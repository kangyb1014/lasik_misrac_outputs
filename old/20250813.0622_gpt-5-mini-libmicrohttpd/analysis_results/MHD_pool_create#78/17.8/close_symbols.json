  "explanation": "ROUND_TO_ALIGN: This is invoked with the parameter (ROUND_TO_ALIGN(max)). If ROUND_TO_ALIGN is a macro (or inline function) that contains an assignment to its argument or other side effects that write into the passed-in identifier, that would constitute modification of the parameter. You must inspect its definition to prove it does not assign to or otherwise modify 'max'.\nmhd_assert: Usually a macro. It is used with 'max' (mhd_assert(max > 0)). A macro definition could conceivably contain side effects (assignments, calls that change local variables via macro expansion); the exact macro definition is needed to ensure it does not modify the parameter.\n_MHD_POISON_MEMORY: Often a macro used for debugging memory (called with pool->memory and pool->size). Even though it does not name 'max', verify its definition in case it expands to code that uses or assigns to local symbols or the 'max' identifier (unlikely but possible in complex debugging macros).\nALIGN_SIZE: Used in the assertion that checks pointer alignment (and used by ROUND_TO_ALIGN implementation). If ROUND_TO_ALIGN or related macros use ALIGN_SIZE in a way that could involve assignment to the caller-supplied expression, you need its definition to reason about side effects.\nMHD_sys_page_size_: A macro or global used in comparisons with 'max' and in computing alloc_size. Its type/definition is needed to ensure no macro trickery (e.g. a function-like macro with side effects) that could modify 'max' in those expressions.\nMAP_ANONYMOUS and _WIN32 (preprocessor flags): These control which code path is compiled (mmap/VirtualAlloc vs fallback). Different compiled branches may contain different macros or inline code that could modify the parameter. You need to know which of these macros/flags are defined (and the definitions of any macros/functions used only in the chosen branch) to fully determine whether 'max' is ever modified.\n\nIn short: focus first on ROUND_TO_ALIGN and mhd_assert (highest risk of writing to the parameter via macro expansion). The other listed macros/definitions are required to rule out conditional/macro expansions that could indirectly modify the parameter."
