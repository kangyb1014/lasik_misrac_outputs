  "explanation": "I focused on all occurrences in the provided code where a non-const pointer type is declared, assigned, or otherwise used in a way that could be affected by Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Other code fragments were not selected because they are not pointer declarations/uses that could reasonably be made to point-to-const, or because the pointer semantics require a mutable target: for example, internal non-pointer computations (alloc_size, pos/end/size assignments), boolean flags (is_mmap), calls that pass NULL as an address to system allocation APIs (mmap/VirtualAlloc take a writable destination and/or accept NULL per their API), casts to integer types for alignment checks (these do not change the pointed-to type), the ROUND_TO_ALIGN/ALIGN_SIZE macros and related integer arithmetic, and the allocation/frees of the pool object itself (the returned pool pointer is intended for callers to modify). In short, only the listed fragments involve pointer types or pointer assignments that should be inspected for whether the pointed-to type could or should be const-qualified; other lines either do not involve pointer types or require a mutable target by design."
