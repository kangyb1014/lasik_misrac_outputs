Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To decide whether SHA1ProcessMessageBlock is dead code (i.e. its removal would not affect program behaviour) you must determine whether the function is reachable and whether its operations have externally observable effects. Each listed symbol is required for that analysis:\n\n- struct SHA1Context (definition: message_block, intermediate_hash, message_block_index and their types/sizes): Needed to determine what state the function reads and writes, whether those writes are observable elsewhere (e.g. intermediate_hash is read by other functions), and whether any writes are initialization-only or used later. Field sizes (e.g. message_block array length) are required to see indexing safety and potential UB that could make behaviour implementation-defined.\n\n- SHA1CircularShift: This function is invoked repeatedly inside SHA1ProcessMessageBlock. If it has side effects (e.g. modifies global state, uses volatile data, or depends on external state), removing SHA1ProcessMessageBlock could change program behaviour. You must inspect its implementation to know if it is pure or has side effects.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage: A direct caller of SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (per the call graph). You must inspect it to see under what conditions it calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock (always, conditional, looped) and whether those conditions are reachable; this determines reachability of the target and whether its calls are necessary for correct behavior.\n\n- SHA1Input: Another direct caller. Same reasoning as for SHA1PadMessage \u2014 examine how and when it calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock and whether those call-sites are reachable from the program.\n\n- SHA1Result: Calls SHA1PadMessage (per the call graph). Include SHA1Result to trace further up the call chain and determine whether callers of SHA1Result invoke the functionality that ultimately leads to SHA1ProcessMessageBlock. It may also read the intermediate_hash values that SHA1ProcessMessageBlock updates, so its use of those values is important to decide observability.\n\n- ws_get_accept_value: Calls SHA1Input (per the call graph). Include it to see a concrete usage path (e.g. web-socket handshake) that might make SHA1Input/ProcessMessageBlock reachable; you need to know whether ws_get_accept_value itself is used by the program and under what runtime conditions.\n\n- main (or other program entry points / framework callbacks that may call ws_get_accept_value or SHA1Result): To prove non-deadness you must show a path from a program entrypoint (e.g. main, server request dispatcher) to any of the callers above. If none of the entrypoints can reach those callers, the SHA1ProcessMessageBlock could be dead. If the actual entrypoints differ, include those concrete symbols instead of 'main'.\n\nIn short: you need the type/layout of the context to assess observable state changes, the implementation of SHA1CircularShift to rule out side effects, each caller in the call chain to establish reachability, and the program entrypoints to determine whether that call chain is invoked at runtime. Without these symbols you cannot conclusively determine whether removing SHA1ProcessMessageBlock would change program behaviour and thus whether it is dead code."
