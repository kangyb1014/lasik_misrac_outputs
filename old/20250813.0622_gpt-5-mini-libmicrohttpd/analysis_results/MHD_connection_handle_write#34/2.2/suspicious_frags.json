The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I flagged all switch-case branches and small checks that consist solely of assertions and immediate returns (or returns with no other visible side-effects), the default-case assertion+error close, the plain no-op returns for certain states, the TODO-marked redundant check in the headers-sending condition, and the debug fprintf that references an apparent undeclared/incorrect identifier (rp). These fragments are suspicious because they are executed in particular states yet perform no substantive behaviour (or look redundant/incorrect) and therefore warrant investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (dead code).\n\nWhy other fragments were NOT flagged: the remaining code paths perform concrete I/O operations (calls to MHD_send_data_, MHD_send_hdr_and_body_, MHD_send_iovec_, MHD_send_sendfile_), update connection state and offsets, call error handling macros, manage mutexes, or are wrapped by conditional compilation (debug/logging and TLS/upgrade support). These operations have observable effects (data transfer, state transitions, error reporting, synchronization) and thus are not prima facie dead code; removal would change program behaviour. Conditional compilation blocks that are disabled at build time are not flagged because they are not executed in that build; they are not executed code that could be removed without effect in a build where they are enabled. The flagged fragments are those that are small/no-op or look redundant/incorrect and should be specifically reviewed for potential dead-code violations or intended design (e.g. assertions compiled out leaving meaningless returns)."
