  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The early-return (if (0 == length) return;) is executed in the described configuration and it changes control flow (the function returns immediately instead of executing the rest of the code). MISRA 2.2 defines dead code as operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour. Even though the later code does not change program state for length == 0 (no transforms or copies, count += 0), removing the early-return would cause extra instructions to execute and thus change timing and execution path. MISRA explicitly notes that timing of actions can be part of observable behaviour for embedded systems (note 1). Because the early-return affects behaviour (control-flow/timing) it is not dead code. The empty test log does not demonstrate a MISRA violation; it only shows the test did not exercise or log the function. Therefore the claim that this is a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
