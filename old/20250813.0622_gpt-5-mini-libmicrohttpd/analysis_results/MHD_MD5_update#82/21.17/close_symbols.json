  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol:\n\n- struct Md5Ctx (complete definition: types and sizes of fields count, buffer, H)\n  - The code indexes and writes into ctx->buffer (casts to uint8_t *). To prove the memcpy destination is in-bounds you must know the compile-time size/shape of ctx->buffer. The type and width of ctx->count are needed to reason about bytes_have, potential truncation, wraparound, and the correctness of the arithmetic (ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE-1)). The H field type is less relevant for memcpy bounds, but included because md5_transform is called with ctx->H and the implementation may affect invariants.\n\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE (macro value)\n  - The code computes bytes_have = ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE-1), bytes_left = MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have, tests while (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length), and performs memcpy of bytes_left or length. To show the memcpy sizes do not exceed destination capacity you must know the numeric value (and that it matches the buffer size) and that it is appropriate (power-of-two assumption used in comment).\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/implementation)\n  - The function contains mhd_assert ((data != NULL) || (length == 0)); whether this provides a runtime guarantee or is a debug-only check determines if you can rely on data being non-NULL when length>0. MISRA analysis cannot assume debug-only asserts make code safe; you must inspect mhd_assert to see whether it enforces the precondition or is compiled out. This affects whether memcpy(source) can be called with a NULL pointer.\n\n- memcpy (declaration/semantics from <string.h>)\n  - The MISRA rule under review is explicitly about the standard string.h functions. You must use the standard documented semantics of memcpy (requirements on source/destination validity, undefined behaviour on overlap, and requirements that you do not read/write out-of-bounds) to determine if the two memcpy calls in this function could violate the rule.\n\n- md5_transform (prototype and implementation)\n  - Although md5_transform is not a string function, it is called with ctx->buffer and may read/write that buffer. To reason about whether the buffer contents/size are preserved and whether any side-effects change buffer pointers/size invariants that impact later memcpy calls, you need its prototype/implementation. Also to confirm the buffer is intended to hold MD5_BLOCK_SIZE bytes (and is not reallocated or replaced) you should inspect md5_transform.\n\n- digest_update (caller that invokes MHD_MD5_update; to see how data/length are supplied)\n  - The actual values passed in as data and length (e.g., origins, whether data can alias ctx->buffer, whether callers allow length>0 with data==NULL, lifetime/ownership) matter to determine whether memcpy could read beyond source bounds or copy overlapping regions. Inspecting the immediate caller(s) (digest_update and, if needed, its callers) helps determine realistic calling conventions and whether the preconditions for safe memcpy are guaranteed by callers.\n\nNote: The struct Md5Ctx entry should include explicit sizes and types for buffer and count; these plus MD5_BLOCK_SIZE are the minimal essential symbols to prove the two memcpy calls cannot write/read outside destination/source bounds. The other symbols are required to validate preconditions (data non-NULL), aliasing/overlap concerns, and whether any side effects invalidate buffer-size assumptions."
