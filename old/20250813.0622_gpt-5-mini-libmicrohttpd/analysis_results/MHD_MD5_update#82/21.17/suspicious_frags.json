  "explanation": "Only the calls to the string.h function memcpy are potentially relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 and therefore need investigation. Other fragments do not require investigation under this rule because:\n- The function asserts (data != NULL) || (length == 0), and an early return is taken when length == 0 (in non-small-code builds), ensuring memcpy is not invoked with a NULL data pointer when a non-zero copy size would be used.\n- The code computes bytes_have = ctx->count & (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - 1) and uses bytes_left = MD5_BLOCK_SIZE - bytes_have together with explicit checks (length >= bytes_left) and the subsequent while loop (while (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length)) to ensure that the sizes passed to memcpy are bounded by MD5_BLOCK_SIZE and that full-block processing is handled separately. These length checks and arithmetic guard against passing lengths larger than a single block to memcpy.\n- Calls to md5_transform are not part of <string.h> and thus are out of scope for Rule 21.17.\nConsequently, only the memcpy invocations should be investigated further (e.g. to confirm the actual size of ctx->buffer, alignment/overlap constraints, and that data points to at least the requested number of bytes)."
