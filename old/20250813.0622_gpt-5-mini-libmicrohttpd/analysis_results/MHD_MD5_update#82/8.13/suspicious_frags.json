  "explanation": "Only pointer usages that relate to const-qualification are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The fragments selected cover all places in this function where pointers are (a) passed to other functions (md5_transform) or (b) produced by casting the context buffer to a byte pointer for memcpy. These are the locations where const qualification of the pointed-to type could be missing or inconsistent (for example, passing a const-qualified pointer to a callee that takes a non-const pointer, or using a non-const buffer where a const pointer might suffice). Other code in the function does not present pointer const-qualification concerns: the function parameter data is already const-qualified; ctx is modified (count and buffer contents), so it cannot be const; scalar operations (count arithmetic, bytes_have calculation, loop control) do not involve pointer constness; and the mhd_assert and control-flow constructs do not affect pointer const qualification. Therefore only the listed call/copy sites need investigation for Rule 8.13."
