  "explanation": "The statement (void) upload_data_size; is an expression-statement that performs no side\u2011effects and whose removal does not change the program\u2019s observable runtime behaviour (it only affects compiler diagnostics). Under the Rule 2.2 definition \u2014 \u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d \u2014 this is dead code. (The only caveat would be if evaluating the operand had side\u2011effects \u2014 e.g. the operand involved volatile access or an expression with side\u2011effects \u2014 which is not the case for a plain parameter identifier.) Therefore Agent A\u2019s report is correct: the example violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
