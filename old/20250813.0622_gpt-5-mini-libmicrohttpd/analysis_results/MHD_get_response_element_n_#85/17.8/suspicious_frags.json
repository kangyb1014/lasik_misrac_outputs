  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. None of the function parameters (response, kind, key, key_len) are assigned to or otherwise modified in this function: response is only dereferenced to read response->first_header; kind and key_len are used in comparisons; key is read (key[0]) and passed to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ but not reassigned. The loop updates the local variable pos (initialized from response->first_header), which is a local pointer \u2014 this does not modify the parameter response itself. The mhd_assert calls only evaluate expressions and do not assign to parameters. Calls to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ pass pointer arguments but any modification of the objects they point to would be permitted by the rule (the rule forbids modifying the parameter variables themselves, not the pointees). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
