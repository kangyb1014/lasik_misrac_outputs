  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments (function signature, local declaration 'struct MHD_HTTP_Res_Header *pos;', the variable uses inside the loop header and body, and the conditional comparisons) are standard control-flow and data operations that directly affect function behaviour and therefore are not obvious candidates for dead code without broader context. Assertions may be implemented as no-ops in some builds, but they are explicit checks and can alter behaviour (e.g. abort/log) in builds where they are active, so they need investigation (and thus are listed). The loop and its if-condition perform the core lookup logic and cannot be dismissed as dead without whole-program analysis (e.g., whether response->first_header can ever be non-NULL or whether the function is ever called). Initialization of variables and return statements are normal parts of control flow; unreachable code is distinguished from dead code by MISRA, so mere absence of execution in some configurations does not automatically imply dead code. Therefore other fragments in the function do not require separate investigation here."
