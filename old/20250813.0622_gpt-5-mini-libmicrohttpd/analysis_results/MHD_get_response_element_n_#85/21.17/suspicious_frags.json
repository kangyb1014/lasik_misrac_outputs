  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not involve calls to the Standard Library <string.h> functions nor perform byte/character buffer operations that could read/write beyond object bounds. The function prologue, variable declaration, the for-loop traversal over response->first_header, the comparison of pos->header_size and pos->kind, and the final return NULL are simple control-flow or integer/enum operations and thus are not relevant to Rule 21.17. The listed fragments should be investigated because they perform direct character access (key[0]) and invoke a string-comparison helper (MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_) that may internally call string.h routines (memcmp/strn* etc.) \u2014 these require verification that the pointers and lengths passed cannot cause out-of-bounds accesses."
