  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to assess MISRA C 'for loop well\u2011formed' compliance for keepalive_possible:\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci\n  - This function is directly called inside conditionals. To be certain the target function contains no for\u2011loops (or for\u2011loop behaviour hidden via inlined/implemented loops) we must inspect this function's implementation: it could contain for loops or modify objects that would be loop counters/flags if a for loop existed in the target. MISRA's rule considers behaviours of called functions when reasoning about a for loop body.\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_token_ci\n  - The static call graph names a closely related symbol. Include it to cover naming variants/aliases (possible macro indirection or different build variants). Same justification as above.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED\n  - This macro/function is used in conditionals. It may be a macro that expands to expressions (possibly containing loops or side effects). We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not introduce for loops or persistent side effects that would violate clause (2)/(3) if part of a for statement.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT\n  - Same rationale as MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED: could be a macro or inline test; its expansion must be inspected to confirm it does not contain loops or side effects.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0\n  - A value used in a comparison with rq.http_ver. We must know the underlying type (enum/int) to determine whether any macros or inline comparisons could hide loop constructs or use objects that could be loop counters in other contexts.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION\n  - Passed to the header lookup function; include to inspect whether it is defined as a macro that might expand to code containing loops or side effects.\n\n- mhd_assert\n  - Typically a macro; its definition must be checked because macros can expand to compound statements that (rarely) might include loops. Verify it is side\u2011effect free (or benign) for the purposes of MISRA analysis.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection\n  - The target function reads many fields (keepalive, rq.http_ver, read_closed, discard_request, stop_with_error, rp.response). We need the struct definition to verify these fields' types (e.g. whether any are volatile or have accessor macros) and to ensure no hidden inline functions or macros are used that could contain for loops or modify loop counters.\n\n- struct MHD_Response\n  - The function inspects response fields (flags, flags_auto, upgrade_handler). Inspecting the struct ensures none of these are defined via macros or inline accessors that hide loops or side effects.\n\n- enum MHD_ConnKeepAlive\n  - The return values (MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE, MHD_CONN_MUST_UPGRADE, MHD_CONN_USE_KEEPALIVE) need to be known to ensure no macros with side effects are used for these tokens; also to confirm return paths do not rely on macros that could involve loops.\n\n- MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT\n  - Bitmask tested in r->flags. Must verify this constant/macro is a plain integer constant and does not hide code with loops or side effects.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE\n  - Bitmask tested in r->flags_auto and asserted against earlier. Verify it's a simple constant and that any code manipulating flags (if implemented via macros) does not insert loops or side effects.\n\n- MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER\n  - Bitmask used in response->flags. Same reason: ensure it's a plain constant and no macro expansions add loops or side effects.\n\n- rq.http_ver (HTTP-version type/enum)\n  - The type and possible value definitions for rq.http_ver (the HTTP version representation) must be checked to see whether comparisons/macros used with it are simple or expand to more complex code (potentially loops). Also required to reason about any potential loop counters or flag objects that could be involved in a for loop.\n\nOverall rationale: keepalive_possible contains no for statements itself. However, MISRA's requirement that the behaviour of a for loop body includes called functions and that macros can hide code means the analysis must inspect all called functions, macros, and any macros/inline definitions referenced in conditionals and field accesses to ensure no for loops are present or no objects used as loop counters/flags are modified by called code. The symbols above cover the called function(s), all macros/constants used in the conditionals, the structures and fields accessed, and the return/value enums \u2014 i.e., all places where hidden code could introduce or affect for\u2011loop correctness."
