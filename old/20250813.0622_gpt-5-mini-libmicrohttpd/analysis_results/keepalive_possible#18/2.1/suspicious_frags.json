  "explanation": "I flagged fragments that are most likely to mask or produce unreachable code paths and therefore should be investigated: the UPGRADE_SUPPORT block (conditional compilation + an early return), the assertion followed immediately by a return on the same flag, the very early keepalive==MUST_CLOSE return, and the final HTTP/1.1 compatibility check that returns KEEPALIVE. Other statements in the function (header token checks, HTTP/1.0 special-case branch, flags checks such as r->flags & MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT, the connection header \"close\" check, and the default return at the end) are normal runtime-condition branches that are reachable depending on request/response state and do not appear intrinsically unreachable. Similarly, uses of both aliases c and connection are semantically equivalent and do not by themselves create unreachable code. These non-selected fragments therefore do not need investigation for Rule 2.1 beyond normal validation of the runtime conditions they test."
