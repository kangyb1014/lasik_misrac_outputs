  "explanation": "For checking MISRA C string/bounds violations you must inspect any code that handles raw header strings and any called routine that may use <string.h> functions. Explanations per symbol:\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci: The target function calls this routine to inspect header tokens. You need its prototype and implementation to see whether it uses string.h functions (strchr/strcmp/strspn/strncmp/strlen/etc.) and whether it bounds-checks accesses into header buffers.\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_token_ci: The static call graph names this variant; include it in case the actual callee differs or there are two similarly named helpers. Same reason as above (implementation may use string functions).\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The function dereferences many connection fields. You need the struct definition to know types/sizes/ownership of pointers (rp, rq, header lists) and to determine whether any pointer passed into string routines can point inside non-terminated buffers.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The response struct fields (flags, flags_auto, upgrade_handler) are read here; the response may also contain header storage or pointers to header data used by the lookup routine. Definition is required to trace where header strings come from.\n\n- MHD_Connection::rp (response member) and type of rp.response: The code uses c->rp.response; you must know how rp.response is stored (pointer to response, embedded, lifetimes) to determine whether any string operations in the callee access memory safely.\n\n- MHD_Connection::rq (request member) and type of rq.http_ver: http_ver drives control flow. Knowing rq type and how headers are associated with the request is needed to find header storage and whether it is NUL-terminated or length-delimited.\n\n- Representation of stored HTTP header values (types/fields that hold header strings and any length fields): Crucial. If header values are stored as pointers into an input buffer without trailing NUL or with explicit lengths, string.h functions like strlen/strchr/strcmp could overrun. You must inspect the header-storage structure and the functions that populate it (parsers) to verify safe use.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_HEADER_CONNECTION: The header name constant passed to the lookup routine; include to confirm how lookup matches header names and whether it performs any pointer arithmetic or copying.\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONNECTION_CLOSE, MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_COMPATIBLE_STRICT, MHD_RF_HTTP_1_0_SERVER: These flag macros affect control flow (whether lookup is called). You need them so you can reason about which code paths invoke the callee and thus which header values will be examined.\n\n- MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED, MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_1_1_COMPAT, MHD_HTTP_VER_1_0: The http version macros/functions determine branches. Knowing their semantics ensures correct path analysis (e.g., which string/lookup checks occur) and hence whether any string functions in the callee may be invoked.\n\n- MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE, MHD_CONN_USE_KEEPALIVE, MHD_CONN_MUST_UPGRADE (enum values): Not directly about strings, but needed to understand which branches cause early returns; necessary to know which header-processing code paths are actually reached in practice.\n\nNotes: The target function itself does not call <string.h> directly, so the primary risk for violating the MISRA string-bounds rule is inside the header-lookup helper(s) or in how headers are stored/populated. Therefore the callee implementation and the header storage/population types/functions are mandatory to audit. "
