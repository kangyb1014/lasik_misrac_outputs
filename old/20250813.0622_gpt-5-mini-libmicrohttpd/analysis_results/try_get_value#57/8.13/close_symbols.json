  "explanation": "To decide whether try_get_value violates the MISRA guidance that pointers should be const-qualified when possible we need: \n\n- process_multipart_headers: the direct caller. Must inspect its prototype and body to see how the 'destination' pointer is declared and subsequently used (is it treated as 'char *', 'const char *', mutated, freed, stored in structures etc.). If callers expect to mutate the pointed-to buffer or store it into non-const locations, then the non-const qualification in try_get_value may be required.\n\n- post_process_multipart: caller of process_multipart_headers. The ultimate use-sites (up the call chain) can determine whether the returned pointer is treated as mutable or should be const; include this caller to see whether const-qualification would be compatible with the rest of the API.\n\n- strlen, strstr, strchr, memcpy: prototypes are needed to check the const-correctness of parameters and return types used in try_get_value (e.g., standard library signatures influence whether passing/receiving const char * vs char * would be appropriate). In particular, strstr/strchr signatures and their returned pointer constness are relevant to whether internal pointer arithmetic and assignment preserve const-correctness.\n\n- malloc: its prototype (void *) is needed to confirm that try_get_value returns a modifiable block (malloc gives a writable buffer) and therefore whether the returned pointer logically should be non-const.\n\n- size_t and NULL: basic typedef/macro declarations are required to fully type-check the function and ensure there are no implicit conversions that affect const qualification decisions.\n\nProviding these symbols (prototypes/definitions and the caller source) allows the next analyst to see whether the function's output parameter could be made to point to a const-qualified type without breaking callers or whether the current non-const signature is justified because the allocated buffer is intended to be modifiable."
