  "explanation": "No fragments modify a function parameter itself. Rule 17.8 prohibits changing the value of a parameter (e.g. assigning to the parameter variable), but allows modifying the object pointed to by a pointer parameter. In this function:\n- 'buf' and 'key' are declared const and are only read; they are never assigned to.\n- 'destination' (char **destination) is never reassigned (no statement like destination = ...). The code assigns to *destination (\"*destination = malloc (vlen);\") and writes into the allocated object (\"(*destination)[...]\" and memcpy). Modifying the pointee is permitted by the rule.\n- All pointer arithmetic and traversal use local pointer variables (bpos, spos, endv) rather than changing the parameter pointers.\nTherefore there are no code fragments that appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation under this rule."
