This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule (no out-of-bounds accesses via <string.h> functions) the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- strlen: the function computes klen = strlen(key) and subsequent indexing uses klen (spos[klen], spos[klen+1], spos[klen+2]). You must know strlen semantics and that key is a valid NUL-terminated string to ensure those indexed accesses do not read past key.\n\n- strstr: used to find occurrences of key inside buf (spos = strstr(bpos, key)). You must know strstr returns a pointer into buf (or NULL) and requires NUL-terminated inputs \u2014 this is needed to reason that spos points inside the readable region of buf and that subsequent pointer arithmetic on spos remains within buf.\n\n- strchr: used to find the closing '\"' (endv = strchr(&spos[klen+2], '\"')). You must know strchr returns a pointer within the given string and requires a NUL-terminated source. This is required to ensure the search does not read past buf and that endv points to a valid location so the computed vlen = (endv - spos) - klen - 1 is correct and non-negative.\n\n- memcpy: used to copy vlen-1 bytes into the newly allocated buffer. To verify MISRA compliance you must know memcpy semantics and ensure the source (&spos[klen+2]) and destination (*destination) ranges of length (vlen-1) are valid and non-overlapping as required.\n\n- malloc: destination buffer is obtained with malloc(vlen). You must know malloc semantics (returns pointer to at least vlen bytes or NULL). The allocation size relative to the memcpy length and the subsequent write to (*destination)[vlen - 1] must be checked to ensure no out-of-bounds writes.\n\n- process_multipart_headers: this function is the immediate caller. To determine whether buf, key and destination meet the preconditions needed for safe string operations (e.g. buf and key are NUL-terminated, buf lifetime/extent, destination initial value, allowed characters in key/buf), the caller\u2019s code or contract must be examined. The safety of strstr/strchr/strlen usage depends on how process_multipart_headers constructs/passes buf and key.\n\n- NULL: the code uses NULL checks (NULL != *destination, NULL == (endv = strchr(...)), NULL == *destination after malloc). The standard definition/semantics of NULL are required to reason about these control flows and error returns.\n\n- size_t: arithmetic and the allocation sizes use size_t; its definition/width is necessary to reason about possible integer overflow in vlen calculation or malloc argument and thus potential out-of-bounds conditions.\n\nTogether these symbols (their prototypes/semantics and the caller preconditions) provide the necessary information to verify that strlen/strstr/strchr/memcpy do not access beyond the bounds of their arguments in the body of try_get_value."
