  "explanation": "I flagged the function parameter 'void *cls' together with the assignment 'struct MHD_Response *response = cls;' because the function only reads fields from response (response->fd, response->fd_off) and does not modify the pointee; therefore the pointer parameter and the local pointer could/should be to a const-qualified type (e.g. const void *cls / const struct MHD_Response *response) and should be investigated for Rule 8.13 compliance. I included the 'const HANDLE fh = ...' declaration and the ReadFile call because HANDLE is a pointer-typed typedef on Windows (an opaque pointer) and the code uses a const-qualified HANDLE variable (which makes the pointer itself const but not the pointed-to type); the propagation and casting here should be reviewed to ensure the pointed-to type const-qualification is correct and not being accidentally discarded or misrepresented. Other code fragments were not flagged because they either require a mutable (non-const) target (e.g. 'char *buf' is written into by read/pread/ReadFile and so must be non-const), are not pointer declarations or uses relevant to pointed-to const qualification (e.g. integer variables, offsets, return-value checks), or already use appropriate constness for their intended use. I focused on places where a pointer to a non-const type is used but the pointee appears to be read-only and thus could legitimately be const-qualified."
