  "explanation": "- struct MHD_Response (complete definition): The function casts cls to struct MHD_Response * and only reads response->fd and response->fd_off. To determine whether cls could be a pointer-to-const (e.g. const void * or const struct MHD_Response *), we must see the full struct to ensure no other fields are read or written here (and to confirm there are no implicit writes). This tells whether the parameter could be const-qualified.\n\n- pread64 / pread / read prototypes: These system calls take the buffer argument as a non-const pointer (void *buf). If the called read routines require a modifiable buffer, then the function parameter char *buf must not be const. The exact prototypes are required to verify whether buf could be const-qualified or not.\n\n- ReadFile prototype and Windows types (HANDLE, LPVOID, DWORD, OVERLAPPED, ULARGE_INTEGER): The Windows branch passes buf to ReadFile, which expects an LPVOID (void *) buffer that will be written into. The ReadFile prototype and related Windows type definitions are needed to show that buf cannot be const in that code path. HANDLE/_get_osfhandle etc. are not required for constness of buf, but HANDLE and LPVOID/OVERLAPPED typedefs are required to inspect ReadFile's buffer parameter type.\n\n- ssize_t and off_t typedef/definitions: These platform typedefs appear in the read/pread prototypes and in return types/offset casts; including their definitions ensures accurate matching of function prototypes and confirms whether any implicit const conversions are permissible. (They are minor but necessary to unambiguously check the signatures used.)\n\nIn short: to decide whether cls or buf could be more const-qualified, we need the MHD_Response definition (to see whether cls is only read) and the exact prototypes/types for the read/pread/ReadFile calls (to see whether the buffer parameter must be a writable pointer). These symbols let us determine if adding const to the parameters would be valid or would violate the call sites' expected non-const buffer types."
