On Windows HANDLE is typically a typedef for void *; therefore 'const HANDLE' is equivalent to 'void * const' (a const pointer to mutable data), not 'const void *' (a pointer to const-qualified data). MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointers to point to const-qualified types whenever possible, so this fragment does not make the pointee const and thus violates the rule. (The root cause is that the const qualifier here applies to the pointer, not to the pointed-to type.)\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <inttypes.h>\n#include <time.h>\n\n/* Provide a minimal definition for HANDLE on non-Windows platforms so this\n   helper can be compiled on any platform.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "Not correct. The agent is right about C typedef/const semantics: if HANDLE is typedef void * then 'const HANDLE fh' is equivalent to 'void * const fh' (a const pointer), not 'const void *' (pointer to const). However, MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever that is possible. In this fragment it is not practicable to make the pointee const: HANDLE is an opaque OS handle type used with Windows APIs (e.g. ReadFile) that expect a HANDLE (non-const) and do not imply access to a pointee object. Making the pointee const (for example changing to 'const void *') would be incompatible with the API and would not reflect the semantics of an opaque handle value. In short, although the declaration does not create a pointer-to-const-qualified-pointee, this is an acceptable situation (the qualifier applies to the pointer itself and the handle is an opaque value/API requirement), so the reported MISRA 8.13 violation is not valid here."
