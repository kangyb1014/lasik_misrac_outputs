  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragments. Specifically:\n\n- There are no GCC/Clang/MSC-specific keywords or attributes (for example: __attribute__, __asm__, __declspec, __extension__, typeof, __builtin_*, asm, pragmas that change language semantics, or inline assembly).\n- There are no compiler-specific storage-class specifiers or calling conventions (for example: __stdcall, __fastcall, __cdecl).\n- There are no use of nonstandard casting or pointer-size hacks that require compiler extensions.\n- The enum and struct definitions use standard C syntax. The fixed-width types (uint32_t, int_least16_t) are standard C99 <stdint.h> types and are not compiler extensions. The ssize_t type is a POSIX typedef (provided by system headers) rather than a compiler language extension; Rule 1.2 requires reporting explicit compiler language extensions documented as such by the compiler, which are not present here.\n- Standard library functions and macros (malloc, free, strncpy, strlen) and the user-defined functions/macros (SHA1*, BASE64Encode, WS_GUID, WS_KEY_LEN, etc.) are not compiler extensions.\n\nBecause none of the above extension constructs are present, there are no code fragments to report for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
