  "explanation": "For deciding whether any operations in ws_get_accept_value are \"dead code\" (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) the analyzer must know the exact semantics, side-effects and inter-symbol relations of the items below:\n\n- WS_KEY_LEN\n  Reason: the function compares strlen(key) against WS_KEY_LEN and uses WS_KEY_LEN when allocating and copying. The truth of that check and the sizes used for strncpy/memory allocation determine whether the allocation and string copies are necessary. If WS_KEY_LEN differs from the assumed value the code paths and null-termination behavior change.\n\n- WS_GUID_LEN\n  Reason: used for the second strncpy and in size calculations. The concatenation length and whether copying includes a terminator depend on WS_GUID_LEN; this affects whether building str is required for SHA1Input and whether bytes beyond the GUID are relevant.\n\n- WS_KEY_GUID_LEN\n  Reason: passed as the byte count to SHA1Input. If WS_KEY_GUID_LEN does not equal (WS_KEY_LEN + WS_GUID_LEN) (or differs in including an extra NUL), the number of bytes hashed differs; that determines whether the two strncpy calls and the concatenated buffer are necessary for correct behavior.\n\n- WS_GUID\n  Reason: the constant string appended to key. Knowing whether WS_GUID is NUL-terminated and its exact bytes is necessary to determine whether the concatenation is required and whether the SHA1 input is correct. If WS_GUID were empty or differently defined the concatenation could be redundant.\n\n- SHA1HashSize\n  Reason: size of the hash buffer that is passed to BASE64Encode. If this value is zero or unexpected the BASE64Encode call or the subsequent NUL store might be unnecessary or incorrect.\n\n- struct SHA1Context (definition)\n  Reason: to determine whether SHA1Reset/ SHA1Input/ SHA1Result operate solely on the stack context or also manipulate global state. If these functions change global state or have externally observable side effects, their calls cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n\n- SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS (constant)\n  Reason: the code tests SHA1Result() against this constant. Its exact value and meaning are needed to decide whether the SHA1Result error-path (free + return MHD_NO) is reachable and thus whether the surrounding code is required.\n\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock\n  Reason: this is called by SHA1Input. If SHA1ProcessMessageBlock has side effects (global state, I/O, timing) those side effects make SHA1Input non-removable; the analyzer must inspect the implementation to decide if the SHA1Input/Reset/Result sequence constitutes necessary behaviour.\n\n- SHA1PadMessage\n  Reason: called by SHA1Result. Same rationale as SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: it may have side effects that make the call sequence required.\n\n- BASE64Encode (prototype/behavior: allocation, null-termination, return semantics)\n  Reason: the function allocates/returns *val and returns a length (or -1). To know whether the subsequent assignment (*val)[len] = '\\0' is redundant (dead), whether BASE64Encode already NUL-terminates, and whether BASE64Encode performs other side effects (e.g. uses external buffers) we must know its exact behavior and contract (does it allocate memory, does it NUL-terminate, does return value include/exclude terminator, is -1 the only failure indicator?). If BASE64Encode already provides a NUL or does not allocate memory, the malloc/free/assignment semantics may be dead or required.\n\n- malloc\n  Reason: the code allocates memory for the concatenated string. Although malloc is standard, the analysis must assume standard semantics (allocation can fail) to determine reachability of error-handling branches. Also the size passed (dependent on WS_ constants) matters for whether allocation is necessary.\n\n- free\n  Reason: used on str in error path and after SHA1Result; if free has nonstandard side effects in the project (unlikely but possible) removing frees could change behaviour. The analyzer must confirm free's semantics and whether those calls are required.\n\n- strlen\n  Reason: used in the initial check (strlen(key)). If strlen has been overridden or has side-effects in the build, that affects whether the initial if-check is necessary. Also correctness of the check depends on exact semantics of strlen.\n\n- strncpy\n  Reason: the function uses strncpy twice to build the buffer passed to SHA1Input. strncpy's behaviour with regard to NUL termination and padding can make those copies necessary or redundant; to determine if either strncpy is dead we must know strncpy semantics and the WS_ constants so we can reason about whether the data written is actually used by SHA1Input.\n\n- MHD_Result values: MHD_NO, MHD_YES\n  Reason: the return values are used to signal success/failure to callers. To decide whether particular return sequences are meaningful (and thus whether preceding operations are required), the analyzer must know the semantics and possible uses of MHD_NO and MHD_YES (e.g. whether callers inspect these or expect additional side-effects/timing).\n\nNotes\n- The static call graph already lists SHA1Reset, SHA1Input, SHA1Result and BASE64Encode as direct callees; the additions above are the constants, types and the SHA1 subroutines (SHA1ProcessMessageBlock, SHA1PadMessage) plus standard library routines whose precise semantics (especially for null-termination and allocation) are necessary to determine whether any statement in ws_get_accept_value can be removed without affecting behaviour.\n- The goal is to detect operations whose removal would not change observable program behaviour (including timing and side-effects). For that we must inspect the definitions/specifications of the listed symbols."
