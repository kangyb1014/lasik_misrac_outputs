  "explanation": "No calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are present in ws_receive_frame. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 specifically governs use of those standard string-handling functions, so there are no code fragments in this function that fall under that rule and require investigation for out-of-bounds accesses caused by such library calls. (Note: the function does perform direct array indexing of frame, masks and msg which could be checked separately for general out-of-bounds risks, but those are not uses of <string.h> functions and thus are outside the scope of Rule 21.17.)"
