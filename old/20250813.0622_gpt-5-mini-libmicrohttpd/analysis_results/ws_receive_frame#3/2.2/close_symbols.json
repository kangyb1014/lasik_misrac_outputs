Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- run_usock: The sole caller of ws_receive_frame (per the call graph). You must inspect its code to see how the returned msg pointer, the in/out length, and the type output are used (or ignored). Whether operations in ws_receive_frame (allocation, decryption loop, setting *type/*length) affect program behaviour depends entirely on how run_usock consumes those results.\\n\\n- WS_FIN: Macro/constant used in the first-byte comparisons. Knowing its value and use is needed to determine which branches in ws_receive_frame are reachable for frames constructed by run_usock (affects whether code is exercised or could be removed).\\n\\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME: Macro/constant used in frame type tests and assigned to *type for text frames. Its definition is required to know the exact bit pattern tested and whether run_usock can ever pass a frame that triggers or relies on this branch.\\n\\n- WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: Macro/constant used for close-frame detection and assigned to *type in that branch. Its definition is required to determine whether the close-frame branch is reachable and whether its side-effects are relied upon.\\n\\n- malloc: ws_receive_frame performs a dynamic allocation for msg. To judge whether that allocation (and consequent initialization/loop that fills msg) is dead, you must know how allocations are handled and whether the returned pointer is used or freed by the caller(s).\\n\\n- free: Include this to check whether the caller (run_usock) or other code frees the returned msg. If the returned buffer is never freed or never used, the allocation may be dead or a resource leak; whether removing allocation changes behaviour depends on follow-up free/usage.\\n\\n- send_all: A function called by run_usock (per the call graph). Inspecting it and how run_usock sequences calls will show whether ws_receive_frame results influence data sent or program behaviour (i.e., whether ws_receive_frame is required).\\n\\n- MHD_upgrade_action: Another callee of run_usock; its interaction with ws_receive_frame (ordering, dependence on *type or returned msg) can determine whether ws_receive_frame's operations are necessary.\\n\\n- ws_send_frame: Called by run_usock; must be checked to see if it consumes data derived from ws_receive_frame (e.g., uses *type or the decrypted msg). If ws_send_frame or other downstream functions never use ws_receive_frame outputs, parts of ws_receive_frame could be dead.\\n\\nNote: The above set is minimal to decide if operations inside ws_receive_frame are semantically required. Inspecting run_usock plus the macro definitions and allocation/freeing policy will reveal reachability, use/ignore of outputs, and whether removing certain operations changes program behaviour (i.e., whether they are dead code)."
