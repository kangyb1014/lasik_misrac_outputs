  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for dead-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: the function's control and data flow depend on the exact layout and types of fields accessed (state, read_buffer, rq, etc.). To determine whether branches can be executed or are redundant you must know the structure definition.\n\n- MHD_Connection::state, ::read_buffer, ::read_buffer_offset, ::rq.field_lines.start, ::rq.field_lines.size, ::rq.req_target_len, ::rq.http_mthd, ::rq.method: the function branches and arithmetic use these fields directly. Their types, ranges and relationships determine which if/else branches are reachable and whether some code paths are effectively dead.\n\n- enum MHD_ProcRecvDataStage: the stage parameter is compared against enumerators; knowing the enum values and valid ranges is needed to decide if stage-based branches are ever taken.\n\n- MHD_CONNECTION_REQ_LINE_RECEIVED, MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_RECEIVED, MHD_PROC_RECV_HEADERS, MHD_PROC_RECV_BODY_CHUNKED: these constants are used in comparisons against c->state and stage. Their values (and the domain of c->state/stage) determine whether associated blocks are reachable or permanently false/true (dead or live).\n\n- MHD_MIN_REASONABLE_REQ_CHUNK_LINE_LENGTH_: used in chunk-size branch; its numeric value is required to decide if that branch is ever true (and thus whether the early return is live).\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: called to detect a Host: header set by the client; its return semantics (return values, when it sets the out-length) determine whether the host-path is exercised or dead. Also the signature (which arguments can be NULL) affects whether that call is reachable or optimized away.\n\n- MHD_HEADER_KIND, MHD_NO: constants/values used with MHD_lookup_connection_value_n; their meanings affect lookup outcome and therefore the branch that computes host_field_line_size.\n\n- MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_, MHD_HTTP_HEADER_HOST, MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_: used to detect if the newly added element is the Host header. Their exact values and string-comparison semantics decide whether the host-detection branch is reachable.\n\n- MHD_MAX_REASONABLE_HEADERS_SIZE_, MHD_MAX_REASONABLE_REQ_TARGET_SIZE_, MHD_MIN_REASONABLE_HEADERS_SIZE_, MHD_MIN_REASONABLE_REQ_TARGET_SIZE_, MHD_MIN_REASONABLE_REQ_METHOD_SIZE_: numeric thresholds used in many comparisons. Their concrete values (relative to runtime variables) determine which of the many mutually-exclusive return branches are reachable; if a threshold makes a condition always false/true, associated code could be dead.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_CONTENT_TOO_LARGE, MHD_HTTP_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE, MHD_HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, MHD_HTTP_URI_TOO_LONG: these return constants are the function outputs. To analyze dead code you must know whether any call-site or higher-level policy relies on particular return codes; additionally, determining whether a return is ever produced requires knowing the constants compared against (thresholds) and the branches that lead to these returns.\n\n- MHD_HTTP_MTHD_OTHER: used to decide whether to compute method_size; knowing which enum value indicates 'other' affects whether the strlen path is ever taken and thus whether method-size-related code is live.\n\n- mhd_assert: often implemented as a macro that can be enabled or compiled out. Whether it evaluates its argument or performs side effects can change code reachability (e.g., if assertions contain expressions that would otherwise be dead if removed). To decide if those assert lines count as dead code you must know its definition.\n\n- strlen: standard function used to compute method length; its presence is relevant to determine whether the block that calls strlen is meaningful at runtime (e.g., if MHD_HTTP_MTHD_OTHER is never true, the strlen call and related code could be dead).\n\nIn short: to determine whether any operation in get_no_space_err_status_code is dead you need the concrete definitions/values and semantics of the structure fields, the enumerators/constants compared against, the helper functions called (MHD_lookup_connection_value_n, MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_), the assertion macro, and the threshold constants used in control-flow. Without those symbols you cannot conclude that a branch is never executed or that removing an operation has no effect on program behaviour."
