  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they already use const-qualified pointer types where appropriate (for example: const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data; static const char *username/password/realm), or they are not pointer declarations (local scalar variables, enum results, response handling). Calls to the library functions and creation/destruction of responses operate on library-defined types and use the types as provided by the API; these are not instances where the local code is declaring a pointer to a non-const-qualified target that could reasonably be made const. The listed fragments are the places where non-const pointer types or pointer-to-pointer types appear in this function and where const-qualification might be applicable, so they should be investigated further."
