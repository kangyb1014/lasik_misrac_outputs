If key is NULL or does not point to a properly NUL-terminated character array (for example, an unterminated buffer or truncated input), strcmp will access memory beyond the bounds of that object -> undefined behaviour. No prior check in the shown code guarantees key is non-NULL and NUL-terminated, so this is a potential violation.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void post_iterator_probe_log(const char *stage,\n                                        const char *key,\n                                        const char *data,\n                                        unsigned long long off,\n                                        size_t size,\n                                        struct Session *session)\n{\n  FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/391.txt\", \"a\");\n  if (NULL == f)\n    return;\n\n  /* Log pointer-valued state only.

  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Agent A\u2019s report is correct as a potential MISRA C:2023 Rule 21.17 violation. The code calls string-handling functions (strcmp and later fprintf(\"%s\", key)) with the pointer key without any local check that key is non-NULL and points to a NUL-terminated character array. strcmp reads bytes until it finds a '\\0', so if key is NULL or not NUL-terminated this will perform out-of-bounds accesses (undefined behaviour) and therefore can violate Rule 21.17. The same concern applies to the fprintf that prints key with \"%s\".\n\nWhether this is an actual violation in a given project depends on an external precondition: if the MHD API (the caller of post_iterator) is documented and relied-on to guarantee that key is always non-NULL and NUL-terminated, and that guarantee is accepted as a verified external contract, then the code need not perform redundant checks and the MISRA issue can be considered addressed by that contract. In the absence of such a documented/verified guarantee visible to the reviewer, the code should be considered non-compliant.\n\nRecommendations: validate key != NULL before calling strcmp/printing, or use a safe comparison that limits the scanned length after proving the maximum length, and document the caller contract (with justification) if relying on it. Also consider checking data != NULL when size>0 before calling memcpy (or rely on documented guarantees)."
