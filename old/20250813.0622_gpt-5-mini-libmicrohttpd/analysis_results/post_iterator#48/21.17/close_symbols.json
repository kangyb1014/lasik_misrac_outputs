This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) struct Session (full definition): The function writes into session->value_1 and session->value_2 and reads session->sid. To decide if memcpy and the explicit NUL writes stay within bounds you must know the exact types and array sizes of value_1 and value_2 (and whether they are arrays vs pointers). The sizeof(...) expressions in the code depend on these definitions. If value_1/value_2 are pointers or smaller/larger arrays the safety conclusion changes.  \n\n2) struct Request (full definition): The function obtains the session pointer via request->session. You need the Request layout to ensure that the session pointer indeed refers to a valid Session object type (not an alias or different type) and to reason about aliasing/ownership that might affect whether destination buffers overlap with the source.  \n\n3) MHD_PostIterator callback contract / libmicrohttpd documentation for the post-iterator arguments (semantics of 'data', 'off', 'size' and 'key'): The safety of memcpy(data, ...) depends on the provenance and guaranteed lifetime/size of the 'data' buffer passed by libmicrohttpd and the meaning of 'off' and 'size' (offset within the whole form field and number of bytes in this chunk). You must confirm that 'data' points to at least 'size' bytes, that 'off' is an offset into the logical value (so the code's offset arithmetic is correct), and whether 'data' can ever alias the session buffers (which would make memcpy undefined if regions overlap). Also confirm that 'key' is NUL-terminated so the strcmp usage is valid.  \n\n4) memcpy (declaration and C semantics): To apply the MISRA rule about not accessing beyond object bounds you must use the standard semantics of memcpy (it copies exactly the given number of bytes and undefined behavior occurs if destination or source accesses exceed the bounds, and overlapping regions invoke undefined behavior). Having the exact standard semantics lets you check whether the computed size and destination address are guaranteed to be in-bounds and non-overlapping.  \n\n5) strcmp (declaration and semantics): The code calls strcmp(key, \"DONE\") and similar. To ensure no reads beyond object bounds you must know that 'key' is a NUL-terminated string (per MHD contract). If key could be non-terminated or point outside accessible memory, strcmp could read out-of-bounds. The strcmp semantics are needed to verify read-only safety.  \n\nTogether, these symbols (Session/Request definitions and the libmicrohttpd callback contract plus the standard semantics of memcpy/strcmp) provide the necessary information to determine whether the memcpy and strcmp uses in post_iterator can ever access memory beyond the referenced objects, and therefore whether the MISRA C rule is violated."
