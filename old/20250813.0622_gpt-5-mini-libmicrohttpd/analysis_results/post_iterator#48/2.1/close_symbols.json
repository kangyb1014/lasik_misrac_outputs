  "explanation": "To determine whether any branch in post_iterator is statically or effectively unreachable (MISRA: no unreachable code), the analyzer needs the following concrete information:\n\n- struct Request: post_iterator casts cls to struct Request* and reads request->session. The definition is needed to know whether request->session can be NULL or how it is obtained (affects whether the function entry can assume a valid session and thus whether subsequent code is reachable).\n\n- struct Session: the body dereferences session and accesses members. The full struct definition is required to reason about member existence and types and to evaluate sizeof(session->value_1) and sizeof(session->value_2) used in the branch conditions (these sizeof results may make some comparisons constant).\n\n- session->value_1 (type and size): the code compares off against sizeof(session->value_1)-1 and uses memcpy into session->value_1. If value_1 has a compile-time size (e.g. fixed array length), those comparisons may be constant or constrain off/size such that some branches become impossible. The exact element type and length are required to decide reachability of the v1 branches and their interior statements.\n\n- session->value_2 (type and size): same rationale as value_1 for reachability of the v2 branches.\n\n- session->sid (type and size): used in fprintf for the DONE branch; its presence and type are needed to ensure the DONE branch is well-formed and reachable when key == \"DONE\".\n\n- enum MHD_Result and MHD_YES: the function returns MHD_YES in every path. While the concrete numeric value does not usually affect reachability, the exact definition (macro/enum) is needed to ensure no hidden control-flow effects (e.g. unusual macro expansion) and to interpret the return type correctly in the context of the caller.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind and the MHD POST iterator callback contract: critical for reachability reasoning because many branches depend on the runtime contract of the caller (libmicrohttpd). The analyzer must know whether the callback can be invoked with a NULL key, what ranges off and size may take, whether filename/content_type/transfer_encoding can be non-NULL or meaningful, and in which situations the iterator is called (e.g. per-field, per-chunk). These semantic guarantees determine whether comparisons and string checks can ever evaluate to true or false and therefore whether any code is truly unreachable.\n\n- Prototypes/semantics of strcmp(), memcpy(), fprintf(): these are standard library functions; the analyzer needs to assume their standard semantics (strcmp compares two NUL-terminated strings, memcpy copies bytes, fprintf may have side-effects) to conclude whether the string comparisons and memory operations could be executed. This also ensures there are no surprising macro redefinitions that would alter control flow.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer decide if any if/return branches are impossible under all valid caller/ABI/struct configurations (i.e. truly unreachable) rather than only unreachable for specific runtime inputs."
