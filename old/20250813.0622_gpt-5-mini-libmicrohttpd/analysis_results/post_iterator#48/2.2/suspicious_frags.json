Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other code fragments need not be investigated for dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2 because:\n- All conditional branches (checks for key == \"DONE\", \"v1\", \"v2\") perform observable actions (fprintf, memcpy, buffer truncation, null-termination) or return; removing them would change program behaviour.\n- The memcpy and subsequent null-termination operations are required to assemble form data correctly; removing them would alter behaviour or correctness.\n- The final fprintf(stderr, ...) reports unsupported keys and is observable; its removal would change runtime diagnostics.\n- The local variable initialisations (request, session) are used by the function; they are not dead.\n- Commented pseudo-code and commented-out assertions are not executable code and therefore not subject to the rule.\n- The callback function in the additional code performs necessary control-flow returns (end-of-stream, bytes-copied) and buffer handling; these operations affect program behaviour and are not removable without effect.\n\nTherefore the only operations in the provided function that are executed yet have no runtime effect (and thus warrant investigation for Rule 2.2) are the explicit void-casts of unused parameters listed above."
