  "explanation": "struct Request: needed to determine the declared type/qualifiers of the request->session member (is it struct Session * or const struct Session *?), which affects whether cls/request could/should be const.\n\nstruct Session: needed to inspect all field declarations and their qualifiers (are fields declared const?), and to decide whether the session object is mutated elsewhere and therefore whether a const qualifier would be appropriate on pointers to it.\n\nstruct Session::value_1 and struct Session::value_2: required to know their exact types (char array vs char *), sizes and qualifiers. If they are char arrays being written into here, they must be non-const; if they are char * pointing to externally owned memory, their declared constness matters for the MISRA check.\n\nstruct Session::sid: required to know its type/qualifier (e.g. char[] vs char * vs const char *) because it is read (printed) here and that affects whether it could/should be const-qualified.\n\nmemcpy (prototype): to confirm parameter types (dest void *, src const void *) so we can reason about whether passing &session->value_x (non-const dest) and data (const src) conforms and whether any pointer should be declared const.\n\nstrcmp (prototype): to confirm it takes const char * arguments so that the const qualification of key and other string parameters is correct in calls (helps validate whether any of these pointers ought to be non-const).\n\nenum MHD_Result / MHD_YES: include the enum definition to confirm the API's expected callback signature/semantics (e.g. whether the callback is expected to mutate cls) and to ensure we are not misinterpreting library callback conventions that could mandate non-const cls.  This helps judge whether cls/Request/session could be declared const in the callback."
