  "explanation": "Reasons each symbol is needed:\n\n- parse_options_va (full implementation): parse_options simply forwards a va_list to parse_options_va and returns its result. Any out-of-bounds use of string.h functions will occur in parse_options_va or its callees, so the complete implementation is required to inspect calls to memcpy/strcpy/strlen/etc., their arguments, and the source/destination buffer sizes.\n\n- MHD_DLOG (macro or function definition): the static call graph shows parse_options_va calls MHD_DLOG. Logging macros/funcs commonly invoke string functions (e.g., vsnprintf, strcpy) or format buffers; the exact macro/func body is needed to determine whether any string operation can overflow.\n\n- struct MHD_Daemon (complete definition): parse_options and parse_options_va take a pointer to this struct. If either function or their callees use members of the daemon struct as string buffers or length sources, the member types and sizes are necessary to bound-check string operations.\n\n- struct MHD_InterimParams_ (complete definition): similarly, params is passed through; fields of this struct might be targets/sources for string operations. Knowing field sizes, array lengths, and related invariants is required to decide if a string.h call can access out-of-bounds.\n\n- any other functions called by parse_options_va or MHD_DLOG (full implementations): the call graph may be incomplete at one level; any further callees that perform string operations must be inspected. Provide their bodies so all string.h usage reachable from parse_options can be analyzed.\n\n- definitions of struct members and constants referenced by the above functions (buffer sizes, length fields, etc.): to determine whether a memcpy/strncpy/strlen/etc. stays within bounds you need the concrete buffer sizes and any constants or macros used to compute lengths.\n\n- declarations/types: enum MHD_Result: include the enum declaration for completeness (not required for bounds checking but useful to follow control flow/return semantics).\n\nProviding these symbols (implementations and struct/constant definitions) gives the next analyst all contexts where standard string functions are invoked and the size information necessary to determine any out-of-bounds accesses under the MISRA rule."
