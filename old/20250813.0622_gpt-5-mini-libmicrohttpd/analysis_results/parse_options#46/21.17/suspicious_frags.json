  "explanation": "No functions from <string.h> (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) are used anywhere in the provided code fragment, and there are no direct operations on character buffers or pointer arithmetic in this file that could lead to accesses beyond object bounds. The enum and simple return/assignment statements are unrelated to string handling and do not require investigation for Rule 21.17. The only elements that could hide string handling issues are the variadic interface and the passing of the va_list to parse_options_va; those specific lines are reported above for further inspection because the called function (parse_options_va) or the variadic arguments (not shown) might perform string operations that could violate Rule 21.17. No other fragments in the supplied code need to be investigated for this rule."
