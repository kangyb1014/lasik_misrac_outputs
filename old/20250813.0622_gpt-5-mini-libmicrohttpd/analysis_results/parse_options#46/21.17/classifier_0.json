  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the given fragment. The statement only passes a va_list to parse_options_va; there are no calls to any <string.h> functions (memcpy, strcpy, strlen, etc.) in this fragment. Therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated here. (Note: a violation could occur indirectly if parse_options_va or other called code subsequently uses string.h functions in a way that accesses beyond object bounds \u2014 that would need to be checked inside parse_options_va and its callees.)"
