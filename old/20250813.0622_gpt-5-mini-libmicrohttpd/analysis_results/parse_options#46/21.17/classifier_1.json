  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment. The use of va_start(ap, params) initializes a variadic argument list and does not call any string.h function or perform any memory accesses; therefore Rule 21.17 is not violated here. A specific violation scenario (hypothetical): if parse_options_va extracted a char* from the va_list and then called strcpy/memcpy/strcat/etc. into a destination buffer without checking its size (e.g. copying a longer source into a smaller fixed buffer), that would violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
