  "explanation": "- va_list: The function uses va_list to receive the variadic argument list forwarded from parse_options; need its definition (from <stdarg.h>) to confirm the implementation is the standard C facility and not a compiler extension.\n- va_start: Used in the function to initialize the va_list. Examining va_start's definition (header/macro) ensures it is the standard macro and not a compiler-specific extension.\n- va_end: Used to clean up the va_list; need to verify it is the standard macro and there's no extension behavior.\n- parse_options_va: The target delegates to this function. Its prototype/definition must be inspected to determine whether it (or its declaration) uses any language extensions (e.g. non-standard calling conventions, GCC attributes, or nonstandard variadic support) that would affect the target or imply use of extensions in the call sequence.\n- enum MHD_Result: The return type; its definition must be checked for any nonstandard enum extensions (e.g. explicit underlying type syntax, attributes attached to the enum) that would count as language extensions.\n- struct MHD_Daemon: The type of the first parameter; its definition should be checked for any nonstandard language extensions in its declaration (bit\u2011fields with implementation-defined widths, packed/attribute annotations, flexible array member extensions, etc.).\n- struct MHD_InterimParams_: The type of the second parameter; its definition must be checked for the same reasons as MHD_Daemon (any attributes or compiler-specific constructs used in the struct declaration).\n- function-declaration attributes / visibility macros (e.g. __attribute__, MHD_EXPORT, MHD_PRIVATE, MHD_NONNULL, etc.): Many projects use macros or compiler attributes in function declarations/definitions. The declaration/definition of parse_options and parse_options_va must be checked for such attributes or macro annotations (which may expand to compiler-specific extensions). Include these symbols to ensure any attached attributes/visibility/ABI annotations are examined.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their headers and definitions) lets the next analyst confirm whether the code uses only standard C variadic facilities and standard declarations or whether any compiler-specific language extensions are present."
