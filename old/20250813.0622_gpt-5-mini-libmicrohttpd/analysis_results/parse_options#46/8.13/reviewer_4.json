If MHD_OptionItem::ptr_value is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. void *), the const qualification is effectively lost when the pointer is stored/propagated and then read with va_arg as a const pointer. This drops const on a pointer that should be const-qualified and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The correct fix is to declare the option-item pointer as a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void * or the appropriate const type) so const is preserved.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nparse_options (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               struct MHD_InterimParams_ *params,\n               ...)\n{\n  va_list ap;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  /* Attempt to open a log file for probes.

  "explanation": "The parse_options implementation shown does not itself violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rule 8.13 concerns pointer declarations that should be const-qualified where possible. The parse_options function only uses va_list and forwards it to parse_options_va; it does not declare or assign pointer object types that drop const qualification.\n\nAgent A\u2019s scenario correctly identifies a real class of problem, but the problem is in the option-item declaration/usage, not in the parse_options wrapper shown. If MHD_OptionItem::ptr_value is declared as a non-const pointer (e.g. void *) and callers pass const pointers (e.g. const char * for MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY), then storing or propagating that value in a non-const pointer field does drop const qualification and that would violate the intent of MISRA 8.13. The actual fix is to change the option-item pointer declaration to the appropriate const-qualified type (for example const void * or const char *), or otherwise ensure const is preserved when storing/propagating such pointers. \n\nNotes on variadic calls: passing a const-qualified pointer through ... does not itself cast away const; however, because variadic arguments are untyped from the callee\u2019s perspective and because assignments to a non-const pointer type can discard const, the unsafe locus is any non-const declaration that stores a pointer that should be const. The logging patch and empty log do not change this conclusion.\n\nConclusion: the agent\u2019s report as stated (that parse_options violates Rule 8.13) is not correct. The underlying correctness concern (non-const option pointer declaration causing const to be lost) is valid and should be fixed, but it is a violation of Rule 8.13 in the option-item declaration, not in the parse_options wrapper itself."
