  "scenario": "The local pointer urh is not const-qualified but there is no evidence in the fragment that run_usock (or any callees used here, except possibly MHD_upgrade_action) needs to modify the object. If ws->urh is intended to be accessed read\u2011only in this function (i.e. only inspected or passed to functions that do not modify it), then the pointer should be declared const: 'const struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = ws->urh;'. In that case the current non-const declaration violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Note: if the API MHD_upgrade_action or other callees mutate the upgrade handle and therefore require a non-const pointer, then the non-const declaration is required and no violation occurs."
