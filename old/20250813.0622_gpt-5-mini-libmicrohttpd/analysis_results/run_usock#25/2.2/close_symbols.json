  "explanation": "For determining whether any piece of run_usock is dead code (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour) the analyzer must know the semantics and observable side-effects of every symbol that affects control flow, branching decisions, resource/state changes, or external behaviour. Each listed symbol is required for that reason:\n\n- struct WsData: need the layout and types of fields (ws->sock, ws->urh) to know whether operations (free(ws), reading sock/urh) have side effects or alias other state and whether removing uses changes behaviour.\n\n- MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle: the type of urh and how MHD_upgrade_action uses it affects observable behaviour of the final call; removing that call might change program state.\n\n- recv: loop entry/exit depends on recv return values; its semantics determine whether the loop executes and whether removing loop body would change behaviour.\n\n- malloc: allocation success/failure affects branches (text allocation) and whether subsequent operations occur; removing related code may or may not change observable behaviour depending on allocation semantics.\n\n- free: frees have side effects on memory state; removing frees can change program behaviour (memory usage/leaks) and possibly visible behaviour in embedded contexts.\n\n- snprintf: return value and formatting semantics decide buf_size and the conditional path that leads to ws_send_frame; must know exact return semantics to decide if that formatting/branching is dead.\n\n- pthread_mutex_lock / pthread_mutex_unlock: locking semantics and return values determine whether abort() can be invoked and whether the cleanup loop is actually protected or reachable; lock behaviour can affect timing and global state visible to others.\n\n- MUTEX: the specific mutex object (address/identity) matters to know if mutex operations contend with other threads and thus whether the protected CLIENT_SOCKS modification is observable/necessary.\n\n- MAX_CLIENTS: loop bound for cleanup; if MAX_CLIENTS==0 the for-loop is dead; need value to check if loop is executed.\n\n- CLIENT_SOCKS: array contents and type are modified by the cleanup loop; removing that modification could change later behaviour; must inspect its role elsewhere to decide if assignment is dead.\n\n- MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: value assigned into CLIENT_SOCKS; if it equals the previous value the assignment might be redundant (dead); need its value to determine effect.\n\n- abort: abort terminates the program; presence/absence changes behaviour drastically. Need to know whether calls to abort are reachable to evaluate dead code status.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME: numeric value used in branch; its value (and possible other code paths) determines whether text-path is ever taken and therefore if code is dead.\n\n- WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: numeric value used for close-frame branch; same rationale as above for reachability of close-path.\n\n- MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE: the action value passed to MHD_upgrade_action affects what MHD does; to decide if the final call is necessary (or removable) its semantics must be known.\n\n(Notes: the static call graph already lists run_usock's direct callees such as make_blocking, ws_receive_frame, ws_send_frame, send_all and MHD_upgrade_action. The above symbols are the additional globals/library calls, constants, and data-structure definitions that influence control flow, side-effects, or observable state and are therefore necessary to decide if particular statements or whole branches in run_usock are dead code.)"
