Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of run_usock:\n```c\nstatic void *\nrun_usock (void *cls)\n{\n  struct WsData *ws = cls;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = ws->urh;\n  unsigned char buf[2048];\n  unsigned char *msg;\n  char *text;\n  ssize_t got;\n  int type;\n  int i;\n\n  make_blocking (ws->sock);\n  while (1)\n  {\n    got = recv (ws->sock, (void *) buf, sizeof (buf), 0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n    msg = ws_receive_frame (buf, &got, &type);\n    if (NULL == msg)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n    if (type == WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME)\n    {\n      ssize_t sent;\n      int buf_size;\n      buf_size = snprintf (NULL, 0, \"User#%d: %s\", (int) ws->sock, msg);\n      if (0 < buf_size)\n      {\n        text = malloc ((size_t) buf_size + 1);\n        if (NULL != text)\n        {\n          if (snprintf (text, (size_t) buf_size + 1,\n                        \"User#%d: %s\", (int) ws->sock, msg) == buf_size)\n            sent = ws_send_frame (ws->sock, text, (size_t) buf_size);\n          else\n            sent = -1;\n          free (text);\n        }\n        else\n          sent = -1;\n      }\n      else\n        sent = -1;\n      free (msg);\n      if (-1 == sent)\n      {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      if (type == WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME)\n      {\n        free (msg);\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_lock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)\n  {\n    if (CLIENT_SOCKS[i] == ws->sock)\n    {\n      CLIENT_SOCKS[i] = MHD_INVALID_SOCKET;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  if (0 != pthread_mutex_unlock (&MUTEX))\n    abort ();\n  free (ws);\n  MHD_upgrade_action (urh, MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE);\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function run_usock:\nstruct WsData\n{\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh;\n  MHD_socket sock;\n}\n...\nstruct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle\n...\nstatic pthread_mutex_t MUTEX = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER\n...\n#define MAX_CLIENTS 10\n...\nstatic MHD_socket CLIENT_SOCKS[MAX_CLIENTS]\n...\n#define MHD_INVALID_SOCKET (-1)\n...\n#define WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME 1\n...\n#define WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME 8\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ngot = recv (ws->sock, (void *) buf, sizeof (buf), 0);\n    if (0 >= got)\n    {\n      break;\n    }\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
