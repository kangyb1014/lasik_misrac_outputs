  "explanation": "For MISRA C unreachable-code analysis we must know which branches and loop exits are actually possible and which functions/objects can force non-return or otherwise alter control flow:\n\n- ws_receive_frame: Determines possible return values (NULL vs non-NULL) and the set of values written to `type`. Essential to decide whether the branches (type == TEXT_FRAME, type == CON_CLOSE_FRAME, or other) are reachable.\n- ws_send_frame: Its return semantics (success value vs -1 on failure) determine whether the code path that checks `sent == -1` is reachable. Also may affect blocking/termination behavior.\n- send_all: Called (transitively) by ws_send_frame in the call graph; its behavior may influence whether ws_send_frame ever returns or can fail (affects reachability of subsequent code).\n- make_blocking: Alters socket blocking mode; if it can abort/exit or otherwise diverge, it affects whether any code after its call can be reached.\n- recv: System-call semantics (blocking, return values on error/close) determine whether the while(1) loop can ever exit via the 0 >= got break condition or if the loop can hang forever (which would make code after the loop effectively unreachable at run-time).\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME and WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: The set of opcode constants and whether they are mutually exclusive or exhaustive matters to know if the else branch (and its inner if) can ever be reached.\n- struct WsData (fields urh, sock): Need layout/types to know whether ws->urh and ws->sock accesses are valid and to reason about side effects (e.g., if sock has special semantics) and to relate socket value to text formatting and client list removal.\n- MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle (type): Its semantics and whether MHD_upgrade_action may not return (or may longjmp/exit) is required to decide reachability of code after free(ws) and the call itself.\n- MHD_upgrade_action and MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: Need to know whether MHD_upgrade_action always returns or can terminate the thread/process (affecting reachability of following code in caller contexts and whether calling it is reachable in normal flow).\n- pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock: They are used with abort() on error; their documented return behavior is needed to know if the abort() path is reachable and whether the code that follows the lock/unlock is reachable.\n- MUTEX (mutex object): Existence and initialization state can affect whether pthread_mutex_lock can fail (hence whether abort() can be reached).\n- MAX_CLIENTS, CLIENT_SOCKS, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: Needed to reason about the for-loop that clears the client socket: whether the loop body can be entered, whether the break is reachable, and whether client-array scanning is meaningful (affects reachability of code inside loop).\n- abort: Non-returning behavior must be considered when analyzing reachability of code adjacent to its calls.\n- malloc, free, snprintf: Standard allocation/formatting functions: their documented behaviors (especially snprintf return values and malloc failure) determine reachability of the branches that set `sent` and the subsequent break on sent == -1.\n\nProviding definitions/semantics for these symbols lets the next analyzer determine if any branch or statement in run_usock is provably never executed (unreachable) under the documented behaviors, and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
