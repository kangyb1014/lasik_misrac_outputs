The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "MAX_CLIENTS: needed to determine whether the second clause of the for (i < MAX_CLIENTS) uses only the loop counter and a non\u2011modifiable object. We must know if MAX_CLIENTS is a compile\u2011time constant (macro/enum/const) or a modifiable variable (which would violate the rule if modified in the loop body). CLIENT_SOCKS: we need the declaration (is it a global array, macro, accessor, or function-like entity?), element type and storage/qualifiers (volatile/atomic). If CLIENT_SOCKS is not a plain array (e.g. a macro or accessor with side effects) or its access has side effects or aliases the loop counter, the for\u2011loop second/third clause constraints could be violated. Also knowing whether writes to CLIENT_SOCKS[i] modify any object referenced in the second clause is required. MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: required to know its definition/type/value and whether assigning it to CLIENT_SOCKS[i] has any side effects (e.g. if it is a function\u2011like macro) or could implicitly modify other objects referenced by the loop control. struct WsData (definition): to confirm the type and semantics of ws->sock (its type, whether it can alias the loop counter or be involved in side effects). Although ws is local, ensuring ws->sock access has no hidden side effects (macros, overloaded semantics) is necessary to conclude the loop counter is the only object modified by the loop body and that the second clause does not use objects modified inside the body."
