  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_uio_read_map_attr:\n```c\nstatic int metal_uio_read_map_attr(struct linux_device *ldev,\n\t\t\t\t   unsigned int index,\n\t\t\t\t   const char *name,\n\t\t\t\t   unsigned long *value)\n{\n\tconst char *cls = ldev->cls_path;\n\tstruct sysfs_attribute *attr;\n\tchar path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];\n\tint result;\n\n\tresult = snprintf(path, sizeof(path), \"%s/maps/map%u/%s\", cls, index, name);\n\tif (result >= (int)sizeof(path))\n\t\treturn -EOVERFLOW;\n\tattr = sysfs_open_attribute(path);\n\tif (!attr || sysfs_read_attribute(attr) != 0) {\n\t\tsysfs_close_attribute(attr);\n\t\treturn -errno;\n\t}\n\n\t*value = strtoul(attr->value, NULL, 0);\n\n\tsysfs_close_attribute(attr);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nsysfs_close_attribute(attr);\nreturn 0;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The two statements are on the function\u2019s successful exit path and are reachable. sysfs_close_attribute(attr) releases a resource acquired earlier; removing it would change program behaviour (resource leak). The final return 0; is required to return the success status (omitting it would change behaviour/lead to undefined behaviour). Therefore these statements are not dead code."
