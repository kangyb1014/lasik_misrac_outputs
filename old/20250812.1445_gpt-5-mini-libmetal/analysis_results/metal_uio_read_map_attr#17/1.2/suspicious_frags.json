  "explanation": "I reviewed the function and the related struct members for usage of compiler-specific language extensions (as documented by common compilers such as GCC/Clang/MSVC). The code does not use any of the following known language extensions that would need investigation: __attribute__ or __declspec annotations, inline assembly (asm), statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, typeof, nested functions, labels-as-values (&&label), GCC/Clang builtins or intrinsics, extended integer types or suffixed integer literals, or other compiler-specific keywords/macros. The constructs present are standard C (array declarations with macro-sized bounds, standard library calls like snprintf/strtoul, pointer casts, errno usage, and ordinary struct and function definitions). Therefore there are no code fragments that, based on the provided snippets, constitute compiler language extensions and need further investigation for MISRA C Rule 1.2."
