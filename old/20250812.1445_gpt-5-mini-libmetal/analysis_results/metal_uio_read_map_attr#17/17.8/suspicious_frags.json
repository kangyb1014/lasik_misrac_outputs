  "explanation": "No function parameter is reassigned in this function. The only write involving a parameter is '*value = strtoul(...)' which modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter value \u2014 this is permitted by Rule 17.8 (the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified). None of the other parameters (ldev, index, name) are modified: ldev is only read, a local pointer 'cls' is set from ldev->cls_path (cls is a local variable, not a parameter), index and name are used but not assigned to, and no pointer parameter is reassigned. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation for Rule 17.8 in this function."
