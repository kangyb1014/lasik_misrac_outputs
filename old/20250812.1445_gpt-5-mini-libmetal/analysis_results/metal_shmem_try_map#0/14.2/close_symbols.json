There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they are required to judge the for-loop against the MISRA rule:\n\n1) metal_virt2phys\n   - The function is called inside the for-loop body. MISRA requires the behaviour of the loop body to be considered including any called functions. We must know whether metal_virt2phys has any side-effects that modify the loop counter (page) or any object used in the loop clauses (e.g. pages, virt, mem) or any global state referenced in the loop clauses. If metal_virt2phys modifies page/pages/virt (directly or via aliasing) the loop may violate clauses (2)-(4).\n\n2) metal_map\n   - metal_map returns the mem pointer used to initialize virt and accessed inside the loop. To reason about aliasing and side-effects we need to know properties of the mapped region (address range, whether it can overlap heap/stack, whether it can alias the phys buffer). Overlap could enable a called function to indirectly modify objects used in the for clauses (e.g. if mem aliases the stack location of page/pages), creating a MISRA violation.\n\n3) malloc (or allocator semantics)\n   - phys is allocated with malloc; to rule out aliasing between phys and mem (or between phys and local variables on the stack such as page/pages) we need to know allocator guarantees used in this environment. If phys memory could alias mem or stack, writes to phys[page] inside the loop body could modify objects used in the loop clauses.\n\n4) metal_phys_addr_t (typedef/underlying type)\n   - Knowing the underlying type/size of metal_phys_addr_t and alignment/representation helps reason about pointer arithmetic/aliasing and whether storing into phys[page] could overlap or corrupt other local objects (e.g. page/pages) via out\u2011of\u2011bounds or unexpected aliasing.\n\n5) struct metal_page_size (ps) definition (page_size, page_shift types)\n   - The loop computes offset = page * ps->page_size and the outer code computes pages = size / ps->page_size. We need the exact types/semantics of ps->page_size (and page_shift) to confirm there is a single loop counter (page), that the expressions in the 1st/2nd/3rd clauses use only allowed objects, and to check for integer promotion/overflow issues that could affect loop control.\n\n6) mem (properties of the mapped memory region returned by metal_map)\n   - To determine whether reads from virt+offset or writes via functions called in the loop can modify variables used in the for-clause we must know location/size/aliasing constraints of mem. For MISRA, the second clause must not depend on objects that the body modifies\u2014if mem aliases stack or other data used in the clauses, that could violate the rule.\n\n7) phys (the allocated array pointer and its layout)\n   - The loop body writes phys[page]. We need the allocation size and layout to ensure that writes do not overflow into other local objects (e.g. corrupting page/pages) and to reason about aliasing between phys and mem/stack.\n\n8) _METAL global (especially _metal.pagemap_fd)\n   - The code path containing the for-loop is taken only when _metal.pagemap_fd >= 0. Knowing the semantics and possible side-effects of the _METAL object (e.g. whether metal_virt2phys depends on or modifies it) is necessary to understand possible indirect modifications of loop-clause objects.\n\n9) METAL_BAD_OFFSET (macro/constant)\n   - The loop body assigns METAL_BAD_OFFSET to phys[page] on error. Knowing its definition is needed to ensure the assignment itself cannot have side-effects (e.g. if it is defined as a function-like macro) that would violate the rule's prohibition on persistent side-effects in the loop clauses.\n\nIn short: the essential item to inspect is metal_virt2phys (its implementation/specification). The remaining symbols are required to rule out aliasing or hidden side-effects (via mapped memory or allocations) that could cause the loop counter or the objects used by the clauses to be modified by the loop body or called functions, which would constitute a MISRA for-loop violation."
