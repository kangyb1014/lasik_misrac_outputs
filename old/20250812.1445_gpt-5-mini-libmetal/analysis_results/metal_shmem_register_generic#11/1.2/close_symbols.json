  "explanation": "To decide whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect the definitions of every macro, function and type it references because extensions are commonly hidden there. Specifically:\n\n- metal_assert: Often implemented as a macro; macros can use GCC/Clang extensions (statement-expression, typeof, __attribute__, __builtin_* or __extension__). Inspect its definition to ensure it is standard-C only.\n\n- strlen: Usually a standard library function but sometimes provided as a macro or a compiler builtin wrapper. Check its header/definition to ensure no use of compiler-specific builtins or macros that count as extensions.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail: Could be a function or a macro. If it is a macro it may use typeof, statement-expressions, container_of tricks or other non\u2011standard extensions. Check the implementation.\n\n- _metal (and its type / definition, including member 'common'): The code uses _metal.common.generic_shmem_list; inspect the definition of the _metal object and its type. It may use anonymous structs/unions, designated initializers, or other constructs that are compiler extensions or forbidden by MISRA.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (definition/type of shmem, including fields: name, io, node): The layout and field types (name, io, node) must be inspected for any use of anonymous unions/structs, bit-fields, flexible array members, GCC attributes, or other extensions.\n\n- definition/type of shmem->io and shmem->io.ops (the ops structure and the type of 'close'): The check !shmem->io.ops.close examines a function pointer field; inspect the ops structure for attributes, nonstandard pointer types, or other extensions in its definition.\n\n- type/definition of shmem->node (list node type) and generic_shmem_list (list head type): These list-related types and any helper macros (e.g., container_of) are frequent places where typeof, statement-expressions, or other compiler extensions are used; inspect their definitions.\n\nChecking these symbols lets the next reviewer determine whether any part of the function (via macros, types, or called helpers) relies on language extensions that would violate the MISRA rule."
