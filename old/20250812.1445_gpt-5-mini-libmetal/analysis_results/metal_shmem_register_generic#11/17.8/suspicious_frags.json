  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies the function parameter shmem itself. The function only: (1) reads shmem->name (passed to strlen) and tests it via metal_assert, (2) reads shmem->io.ops.close via metal_assert, and (3) takes the address of shmem->node and passes it to metal_list_add_tail. There is no assignment to shmem (no shmem = ...), no increment/decrement of the pointer, and no other operation that changes the pointer value. Modifications performed by metal_list_add_tail would affect the object pointed to by shmem (its node), which is permitted by Rule 17.8. The metal_assert macro expands to metal_sys_assert(cond) and does not modify the parameter. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for violating Rule 17.8."
