  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide if this function is dead code:\n\n- metal_assert\n  - The function\u2019s behavior (and whether any expressions are evaluated) depends on the assert implementation. If metal_assert is a no-op in production builds the two checks (name and ops.close) \u2014 and the strlen() call used inside the assert \u2014 may be removed by the compiler; if metal_assert aborts the program on failure it introduces observable behavior. Knowing its definition is necessary to determine if the function as written has side effects or is a no-op.\n\n- strlen\n  - Called inside the assert expression. Even though strlen normally has no side effects, whether it is evaluated depends on metal_assert. Its presence affects whether this line introduces any executed code in production builds.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail\n  - The only unconditional side-effect in the function is the call to this routine. You must inspect its implementation/semantics to know what state it mutates (the list head, node pointers, possible memory operations) and whether those mutations are observed elsewhere \u2014 i.e., whether this call produces behavior that would be lost if the function were removed.\n\n- _metal (specifically _metal.common.generic_shmem_list)\n  - The list head that metal_list_add_tail mutates. To decide whether adding the node is meaningful you must know the lifetime, visibility and uses of this global list object; e.g., is it read later during normal operation, initialization, or teardown. Its definition/type and linkage are required to trace consumers.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (definition)\n  - The function accesses shmem->name, shmem->io.ops.close and shmem->node. You need the struct layout and types to know whether those accesses have side effects (e.g., volatile fields, special accessors), whether node is the correct type for list insertion, and if name/io have other semantics that affect behavior.\n\n- struct metal_list / node type used by shmem->node\n  - The list node type and invariants determine whether adding the node is semantically meaningful or can corrupt state. Also needed to match metal_list_add_tail\u2019s expectations and to see whether node insertion will be observed by list consumers.\n\n- list-iteration / consumer functions that read generic_shmem_list (e.g. metal_list_for_each, any functions that search or consume generic_shmem_list)\n  - To determine whether adding shmem->node to the global list changes program behaviour you must find and inspect all functions that iterate/read generic_shmem_list (look for search/unregister/open/close routines). If no code ever reads that list or the reads are only for debug, the add might be dead; if other code depends on the list contents, it is live.\n\n- callers / registration tables that may reference metal_shmem_register_generic (static init tables, exported symbol references)\n  - Static call graph gave no callers; to decide deadness you must verify there are truly no callers (direct or indirect). The function could be referenced from registration tables, init-call sections, device driver tables, or exported for external use. You need the symbol references (linker/export tables or all places that take its address) to conclude whether the function itself is reachable/used.\n\nIn short: confirm how assertions are handled, what side-effects metal_list_add_tail produces and whether those effects are consumed, the data types involved, and whether the function is reachable from any registration/caller site. These symbols provide the required information to decide if removing the function (or its statements) would change program behaviour (i.e. whether the code is dead)."
