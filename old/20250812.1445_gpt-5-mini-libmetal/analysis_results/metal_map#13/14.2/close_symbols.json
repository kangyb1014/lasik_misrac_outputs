The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",
  "close_symbols": [],
  "explanation": "No additional symbols are required. The MISRA rule concerns the form and contents of for statements (including the behaviour of any functions called from within a for loop body). The provided metal_map implementation contains no for loops, and therefore there are no for-loop clauses or loop bodies that need inspection. The function also does not call any functions from inside a for loop, so there are no callee implementations that would need to be examined for for-loop compliance. Consequently, no extra symbols (types, macros, or called-function definitions) are necessary to determine whether metal_map violates the cited MISRA for-loop rule."
