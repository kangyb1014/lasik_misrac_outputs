  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required for dead-code (MISRA) analysis of metal_map:\n\n- PROT_READ / PROT_WRITE: Determine whether the initial prot = PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE has any side effects or is redundant for the intended mappings; needed to see if setting prot is a no-op under all call sites.\n\n- MAP_SHARED / MAP_PRIVATE / MAP_ANONYMOUS: The function forces flags |= MAP_SHARED and later may overwrite flags with MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS when fd < 0. To decide if the initial flags |= MAP_SHARED is dead in any path you must know the semantics of these macros and whether callers ever rely on the resulting flag combination.\n\n- MAP_FAILED: Needed to interpret the mmap return check (mem == MAP_FAILED) and whether that branch (return -errno) is reachable/observable.\n\n- mmap: Core effectful call \u2014 its semantics (side effects, behavior when fd == -1 or MAP_ANONYMOUS set, and whether offset is significant) determine whether prior operations (e.g., fd = -1, flags mutation, locking/truncation) are necessary. Also whether mmap can silently succeed/fail in ways that make earlier operations dead.\n\n- flock / LOCK_EX / LOCK_UN: flock calls provide side effects (process-level file locking). To judge whether the flock calls (and subsequent unlock) are dead you must know flock semantics and whether removing them would change program behavior (concurrency/protection).\n\n- fstat and ftruncate: These mutate or query the file state (st_size) and may produce side effects (ftruncate changes file size). Determine whether these calls are necessary or could be removed without changing behavior.\n\n- errno: The function captures and returns errno-derived negative values. Understanding errno semantics (when it is set/cleared by the used syscalls) is necessary to see if the intermediate 'error' variable and the pattern of setting/returning -errno produce meaningful behavior or are redundant/dead.\n\n- struct stat (st_size): fstat populates struct stat and st_size is used to decide whether to call ftruncate. To decide if that branch (and ftruncate) is dead, you must know the layout/meaning of st_size and whether callers/filesystems make that comparison ever true.\n\n- off_t / size_t: Types for offset/size affect arithmetic (overflow, reqsize = offset + size) and thus reachability of the expand path; these type semantics matter to decide if the expand branch can ever be taken or is dead.\n\n- metal_uio_dev_open and metal_shmem_try_map (callers): Dead-code determination requires knowledge of all call sites: whether they ever call metal_map with parameters that make particular branches reachable (e.g., fd < 0, expand true). The callers' code/usage patterns are needed to determine if branches inside metal_map are ever executed in the project (removability check).\n\nIn short: to decide if any statements/branches in metal_map are dead you must know the OS-level call semantics and the actual call-site argument patterns; the symbols above supply those semantics and callers needed for a sound determination."
