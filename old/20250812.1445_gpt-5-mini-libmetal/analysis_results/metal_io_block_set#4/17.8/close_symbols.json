  "explanation": "- metal_io_virt: You must inspect the actual definition (or macro expansion) of metal_io_virt because if it is implemented as a macro it could expand to code that assigns to the local parameter identifiers (e.g. 'offset' or 'io'), thereby indirectly modifying a function parameter. If it is a function, its prototype confirms it cannot change caller-local parameter variables.\\n\\n- struct metal_io_region: The full struct declaration is required to know whether the 'io' parameter is declared with any const qualification in the true prototype and to see the 'size' member usage (the code reads io->size). Knowing the exact type ensures we correctly interpret accesses to io and whether any operations on its members might modify parameter storage.\\n\\n- type of io->ops and declaration of block_set member: The ops structure definition (type of io->ops) is needed to determine whether 'block_set' is actually a function pointer, a macro, or something else. If block_set is a macro (or its type expands oddly) its expansion could modify local parameter variables. If it is a function pointer, the pointer call cannot by itself reassign the caller's parameter variables.\\n\\n- declaration/definition of io->ops.block_set (callable): The concrete declaration/prototype or macro expansion of the callable used when io->ops.block_set is non-NULL is needed to ensure that calling it does not rely on passing a parameter by reference that would cause this function to modify its own parameter variables (and to ensure the symbol isn't a macro that manipulates identifiers in the caller).\\n\\n- prototype/declaration of metal_io_block_set (header view): Verify the externally visible prototype/headers to confirm whether any of the parameters are declared with const qualifiers (e.g. const int len) or different types in headers vs. this definition; that affects whether modifying 'len' (or other parameters) in the function violates the rule.\\n\\n- atomic_thread_fence and memory_order_seq_cst definitions: These are used in the function and may be macros. If either is a macro that expands into code referencing or assigning to local identifiers (unlikely but possible in some embedded headers), that could modify parameters. Inspecting their definitions rules out that possibility."
