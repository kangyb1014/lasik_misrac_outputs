  "explanation": "The reported fragments are the only locations where pointers to non-const data are created, passed, cast or dereferenced and therefore may need review under Rule 8.13. Other parts of the function do not introduce new pointer types that could/should be const-qualified: the integer variables (retlen, len, i, cint), the CHAR_BIT/sizeof calculations, the bounds checks and arithmetic on offsets and sizes, the loops' control expressions, the construction of the repeated byte value (cint), the early NULL/size checks, the return statement, and the call to atomic_thread_fence do not involve pointers to non-const pointees and thus are not relevant to this const-qualification rule. The struct definition fields shown (virt, physmap, size, page_shift, page_mask, mem_flags, ops) either are already const where appropriate (physmap) or are used here in contexts that require non-const access (e.g. writing through virt) and so other parts of the struct need not be investigated further for this rule based on the provided code."
