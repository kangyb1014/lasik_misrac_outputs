  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_device_open itself modifies any of its parameters (violating MISRA rule), the analyser needs the following symbols:\n\n- strlen (declaration): to confirm strlen is a pure reader and not a macro/inline that could modify the bus_name or dev_name pointer (or the characters they point to).\n\n- metal_bus_find (prototype/signature): to see the parameter types (e.g. const char * vs char *) and confirm whether the call could legally/semantically write through or otherwise affect the passed-in bus_name pointer. Also to ensure nothing about the call expression implies modification of the local parameter variables.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): so the analyser can inspect the ops member and ensure accessing bus->ops.dev_open is a normal member access (not some macro trick) and to understand the types involved.\n\n- type of struct metal_bus::ops (definition) including dev_open member: to know whether dev_open is a function pointer and its declared type, or something else that could expand/behave in a way that assigns to the local parameter variables.\n\n- prototype/signature of dev_open (the function-pointer type stored in ops): to confirm whether calling (*bus->ops.dev_open)(...) could modify the local parameter variable 'device' itself (it cannot directly, but the signature shows whether device is passed as a pointer-to-pointer and whether const qualifiers exist \u2014 important to reason about permitted modifications to the pointed-to object vs the pointer variable).\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): to understand what is being pointed to/returned via the struct metal_device **device parameter (to distinguish allowed modifications of the pointed-to object from prohibited modification of the pointer parameter itself).\n\n- EINVAL and ENODEV (macro definitions): to ensure these are ordinary error macros (no side effects/macros that could expand to code that assigns to parameters).\n\nTogether these symbols let the analyser decide whether any code path or invoked macro/function could modify the parameter variables (bus_name, dev_name, device) themselves rather than only the objects they point to."
