  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 17.8 because they do not modify function parameters nor perform pointer assignments: the local declarations (struct metal_bus *bus; int error;) merely declare locals; the input validation (the if with !bus_name, !strlen(...), !dev_name, !strlen(...), !device) only reads and tests the parameter pointers and does not assign to them; the call to metal_bus_find(bus_name, &bus) passes bus_name as a const char * (no assignment to the parameter in this function) and only writes to the local 'bus' variable; the check for bus->ops.dev_open and subsequent error returns only test pointers and return error codes; final return 0; does not modify any parameters. These fragments therefore do not suggest modification of the parameter pointers themselves and do not need further investigation under Rule 17.8."
