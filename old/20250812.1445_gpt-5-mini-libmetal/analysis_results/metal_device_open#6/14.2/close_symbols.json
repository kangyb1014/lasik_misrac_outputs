Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to judge the MISRA 'for loop well\u2011formed' rule for metal_device_open:\n\n- strlen: It is called in the target function's conditional checks. If a for\u2011statement in this function used strlen in a clause, we must know whether strlen has any persistent side effects (second\u2011clause prohibition) or modifies any objects used as loop counters. Provide its implementation/signature to confirm it is side\u2011effect free.\n\n- metal_bus_find: Direct callee of the target. To determine whether any for loop in the target (or its clauses) invokes metal_bus_find (or whether its behaviour affects objects used as loop counters), we need its prototype and implementation to see whether it has side effects or modifies objects visible to the caller.\n\n- struct metal_bus: The target dereferences 'bus' (bus->ops). Knowing the struct layout is required to identify the ops member type and to determine whether accessing bus or its fields could involve macros or inline code that include for loops or side effects relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops (bus->ops, including dev_open prototype): The dev_open member is invoked through a function pointer. We need the ops type/prototype to know what arguments are passed and whether calling dev_open may modify objects that could be used as loop counters or introduce side effects relevant to the rule (e.g. via global state).\n\n- implementations of dev_open (all functions that may be assigned to bus->ops.dev_open): The behaviour of any function called inside a for loop body is part of that loop's behaviour. To ensure compliance we must examine all possible dev_open implementations for for\u2011loops that violate the three\u2011clause constraints or that modify objects used as loop counters; also to check for persistent side effects in expressions used in loop clauses.\n\n- struct metal_device: The out parameter is passed to dev_open. Knowing this type shows what dev_open may modify and whether those modifications could interact with loop counters or control flags used in any for statements in the target or callee.\n\n- EINVAL, ENODEV: Error macros/constants are used by the target. While they do not affect for\u2011loop formation directly, their definitions/expansions should be known to ensure no unexpected macros expand into code containing for statements or side effects that could affect MISRA analysis.\n\nIn short: to verify the MISRA for\u2011loop constraints you must inspect any functions or objects that could appear in for clauses or be modified/observed by loop bodies. That requires the listed symbols (called functions, the bus/ops layout, dev_open implementations, and types passed/modified)."
