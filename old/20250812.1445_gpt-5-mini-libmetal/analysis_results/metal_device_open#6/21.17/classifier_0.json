  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The fragment only calls metal_bus_find(bus_name, &bus). Prior checks ensure bus_name is non-NULL and strlen(bus_name) > 0, so there is no immediate use of <string.h> functions in this fragment that would access beyond the object bounds. (Note: the earlier calls to strlen must themselves operate on a null-terminated object; if they were given a non-terminated buffer then those strlen calls \u2014 not this fragment \u2014 would violate Rule 21.17.)"
