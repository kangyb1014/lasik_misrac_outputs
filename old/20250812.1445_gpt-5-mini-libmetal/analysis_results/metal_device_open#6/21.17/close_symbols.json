  "explanation": "Reasons for each required symbol (concise):\n\n- strlen (from <string.h>): metal_device_open calls strlen(bus_name) and strlen(dev_name). To determine if these calls can access beyond object bounds you must reason about strlen's byte-by-byte scan for a terminating '\\0' and the conditions that guarantee a termination within the object\u2019s allocated bounds.\n\n- metal_bus_find (function and implementation): metal_device_open passes bus_name to metal_bus_find; metal_bus_find's implementation may read bus_name, copy it, or impose constraints on it. You must inspect metal_bus_find to see whether it accesses bus_name in a way that assumes NUL-termination or limited buffer lengths (which could reveal whether bus_name passed into metal_device_open is always safe for strlen).\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): metal_device_open dereferences bus->ops.dev_open after metal_bus_find. The struct definition is needed to see layout, how ops is stored, and whether any implicit assumptions about bus lifetime or ownership affect the validity of bus_name/dev_name pointers.\n\n- struct metal_bus_ops / dev_open member type (prototype/type): The code checks and calls bus->ops.dev_open. You need the dev_open function pointer type (signature) to know how dev_open will use dev_name (e.g., const char * vs. char *, expected termination rules). The prototype also indicates whether dev_open may expect bounded strings or lengths instead of NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- Implementations/prototypes of concrete dev_open functions registered on metal_bus->ops: Even if metal_device_open itself only calls strlen on dev_name, dev_open implementations may also call string.h functions on dev_name. To assess overall MISRA compliance for string handling related to this call path you must inspect those implementations (or their contracts) to ensure they do not read beyond bounds.\n\n- All callers of metal_device_open (call sites and argument provenance): To establish whether passing bus_name and dev_name to strlen is safe you must inspect where those pointers come from (stack buffers, static strings, network input, partial buffers, etc.). Callers may guarantee NUL-termination or provide lengths; without examining callers you cannot prove strlen will not overrun the source objects.\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): metal_device_open writes to *device (via dev_open). While not directly required for analyzing strlen, the device struct and how it is used may reveal lifetimes/ownership or expectations about dev_name strings (for example if dev_open stores pointers into caller buffers), which can affect whether the caller must supply NUL-terminated, properly sized storage.\n\nNote: definitions of errno macros (EINVAL, ENODEV) are not relevant to the string-bounds MISRA rule and are therefore omitted."
