  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions (MISRA rule check), the analyzer must inspect the declarations/definitions and macro expansions of all referenced types, functions and macros because extensions are often introduced there. For each listed symbol:\n\n- struct linux_device: its definition may use compiler extensions (e.g., attributes, bit-fields with implementation-specific widths, flexible arrays, or nonstandard qualifiers) and its members (sdev, dev_name, override) are referenced in the function.\n- type of ldev->sdev: the sdev object's struct/typedef may contain attributes, nonstandard string storage, or other extensions; driver_name is read so its definition must be checked.\n- struct linux_driver: its layout and any attributes or nonstandard constructs (drv_name, sdrv) could introduce extensions.\n- type of ldrv->sdrv: sdrv may be a different struct (e.g., a sysfs driver type) that could carry extensions or attributes used by sysfs accessors.\n- struct sysfs_attribute: attribute struct definitions often include annotations or compiler attributes; sysfs_write_attribute and getters accept/return this type, so inspect it for extensions.\n- sysfs_get_device_attr/sysfs_get_driver_attr/sysfs_write_attribute: their prototypes or definitions may use GCC/clang extensions (attributes, inline asm, typeof, statement expressions, nonstandard calling conventions); macros could wrap calls with extensions. You must inspect their declarations/definitions.\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_* macros: logging macros are commonly implemented as complex macros (variadic macros are standard in C99 but macro internals may use GNU extensions like statement expressions or typeof). Inspect expansion for any extension usage.\n- SYSFS_UNKNOWN: could be defined using nonstandard constructs or special macros; check its definition.\n- errno and E* error macros (-EBUSY, -ENOTSUP): errno may be implemented as a macro that expands to a function or thread-local accessor (e.g., __errno_location()) which can be compiler-specific; error macros are defined in headers \u2014 check these definitions for extensions.\n- strcmp and strlen: standard library declarations are usually safe, but custom replacements or wrappers in the codebase could use extensions; verify the actual declarations in scope.\n\nIn short, any symbol whose declaration/definition or macro expansion could hide compiler-specific extensions must be examined to decide whether the target function uses language extensions. The list above covers all such symbols referenced directly by the function."
