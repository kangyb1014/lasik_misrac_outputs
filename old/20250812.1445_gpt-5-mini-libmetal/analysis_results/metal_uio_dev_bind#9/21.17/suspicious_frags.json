  "explanation": "Only calls to string handling functions or code that passes string lengths to write-like APIs are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The fragments above include all uses of string.h functions in this function: the strcmp calls (which require valid, null-terminated input strings and non-null pointers) and the strlen calls (whose results are passed to sysfs_write_attribute, which may copy that many bytes). These sites can lead to out-of-bounds accesses if the strings are not null-terminated, the pointers are NULL, or the destination sysfs attribute buffer is smaller than the provided length.\n\nOther fragments in the function do not call string.h functions or perform length-based memory operations and therefore are outside the scope of Rule 21.17: - The sysfs_get_device_attr / sysfs_get_driver_attr calls and the subsequent null checks (if (!attr)) verify attribute existence but are not string.h usages. - metal_log calls and format strings use %s for printing but do not themselves invoke the string.h functions targeted by this rule. - Assignments, returns, and the final ldev->override = attr; do not perform string handling or length-based copying. Consequently those fragments need not be investigated for Rule 21.17 (though they may be relevant to other rules)."
