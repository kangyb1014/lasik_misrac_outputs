  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_virt2phys violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyzer must (a) inspect every function and symbol the target calls (or which affect its behavior) to see if memcmp is used on NUL\u2011terminated strings, and (b) understand the data types and error handling used in the function. Each listed symbol is needed for these reasons:\n\n- pread: Called directly in metal_virt2phys. We must inspect its use site and any wrapper/overload to confirm no memcmp call is hidden in a wrapper or error handling path.\n\n- strerror: Called to format an error message. Because it returns C strings that are then passed to metal_log, the implementation or wrapper should be checked to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- errno: Global error variable read by strerror or used in the error return path. Inspecting errno usage ensures no unexpected string comparisons occur in error handling.\n\n- metal_log: Logging function called with formatted strings. The implementation must be checked to ensure it does not internally call memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings when handling format/levels/messages.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: Logging level/macro used with metal_log; included so the analyzer can locate the exact log path and corresponding metal_log handling code to inspect for memcmp usage.\n\n- _metal (structure) and its fields pagemap_fd, page_shift: These fields control code paths (early return if pagemap_fd < 0, bitshift of resultant physical address). They determine which branches execute; the analyzer must know these to reason about whether any string handling (and thus memcmp) could be invoked in reachable code paths.\n\n- EINVAL, ENOENT: Errno constants used in the return values; included to trace error reporting paths and any code that formats or compares these error conditions (potentially involving string operations).\n\n- off_t, uint64_t, uintptr_t: Type definitions used in arithmetic and shifts. Needed to ensure no implicit conversions cause different code paths that might invoke string comparisons.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: The static call graph shows this function as a caller of metal_virt2phys. While the rule applies to the target function, the caller should be inspected if it forwards strings into metal_virt2phys indirectly or shares logging/error helpers that might contain memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nIn short, these symbols cover all direct callees, logging/error formatting sites, the relevant global state and types, and the immediate caller so the analyzer can confidently conclude whether memcmp is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings in any code path reachable from metal_virt2phys."
