  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to decide if any code in metal_virt2phys is unreachable:\n\n- _metal: global structure whose state controls the early return and final address computation. To determine reachability of any branches you must know its definition and lifetime.\n- _metal.pagemap_fd: tested at function entry (if < 0 return). Knowledge of how/when this field can be negative (initial value, initializers, code that changes it) is required to know whether the early-return path is ever taken (and therefore whether subsequent code could be unreachable).\n- _metal.page_shift: used both to compute the offset for pread and to shift the extracted PFN into *phys. Its range and initialization determine whether the shifts are defined and whether code that uses the value is reachable/meaningful.\n- metal_io_init: an initializer that (per call graph) is invoked by callers before metal_virt2phys; its behavior and whether it sets _metal.pagemap_fd (or fails) affects whether the early-return branch is reachable.\n- metal_shmem_try_map: direct caller (per call graph). Examining this caller and its control flow is necessary to know under what circumstances metal_virt2phys is invoked, which impacts reachability of branches inside metal_virt2phys.\n- pread: the read operation whose return value determines the error path. You need the prototype/semantics (return value on success/failure, errno behavior) to know if the error branch (logging and return -errno) can be taken and thus whether subsequent code is reachable.\n- errno: used in the error return path (and passed to strerror). Knowing whether errno is modified elsewhere or by pread semantics is necessary to reason about that error-return path.\n- strerror: used inside the error logging call. Although it does not by itself alter control flow, an analyzer must know whether strerror may be non-returning or have side effects that could affect reachability (very unlikely but must be checked for MISRA unreachable-code analysis).\n- metal_log: called on error paths. Crucially, the analyzer must know whether metal_log may be a non-returning routine (e.g., calls exit/abort) or otherwise alter control flow; if metal_log never returns, code after the call could be unreachable.\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR: logging level constant used with metal_log; included so the analyzer can find the metal_log implementation use-site corresponding to this level (to check non-returning behavior or other side effects).\n- EINVAL, ENOENT: errno macros returned by the function. Although their numeric values do not change reachability, they appear in return statements \u2014 include them so the analyzer can match behavior with other code paths and identify if any return statements are effectively unreachable due to constant folding or contradictory conditions.\n- off_t, uint64_t, uintptr_t: type definitions that affect arithmetic/shift semantics in offset and *phys calculation. To decide if certain operations are undefined (e.g., invalid shifts) or if a branch condition can be determined constant at compile time, the exact types and widths are required.\n\nIn short: to prove the absence (or existence) of unreachable code inside metal_virt2phys you must know the global state and its initialization (the _metal object and init functions), the behavior and return/error semantics of pread/errno/strerror, and whether metal_log (or any called routine) can be non-returning. The listed symbols provide the minimal cross-reference points needed for that analysis."
