  "explanation": "List of symbols and why each is needed to decide if code in metal_virt2phys is dead (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour):\n\n- _metal\n  - The global object whose state determines control flow in the function. You need its definition to know whether the function can ever observe values that make the branches meaningful.\n\n- _metal.pagemap_fd\n  - Checked at function entry (if < 0 return -EINVAL). To determine if the early return is reachable and thus whether the subsequent code is ever executed, you must know how and where pagemap_fd is initialized/changed.\n\n- _metal.page_shift\n  - Used to compute the pagemap offset and to shift the returned PFN into a physical address. Its value affects the computed offset and output; removing code that uses it could change behaviour. Need to know possible runtime values.\n\n- pread\n  - Performs the pagemap read and its return value controls error path vs normal flow. To judge whether the error-handling branch (and associated metal_log/strerror use) is live or removable, the semantics and possible return values of pread in the target environment must be known.\n\n- errno\n  - Used after a failing pread to produce the returned negative errno and to form the strerror message. Whether the errno-based return value is observable by callers affects whether that error-handling code is necessary.\n\n- strerror\n  - Called when pread fails to create a log message. If logging is considered a side effect, the presence/absence of strerror/metal_log calls matters to whether the logging code is dead.\n\n- metal_log\n  - Logging function invoked on error and on a non-present page. Because logging is an observable side effect, you must know what metal_log does (e.g. side effects, conditional compilation, noop in some builds) to decide if those log calls are dead code.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR\n  - Macro/constant passed to metal_log to select log level. Needed to understand whether the log invocation has effect in build configurations (it could be compiled out or no-op depending on level), which changes whether the logging statements are removable.\n\n- EINVAL\n  - Error code returned when pagemap_fd < 0. To know whether returning -EINVAL is observable and thus whether that branch is required, you need the definition/use of EINVAL in the project.\n\n- ENOENT\n  - Error code returned when the pagemap entry indicates page not present. Same reasoning as EINVAL: knowledge of how callers handle this code determines if that branch is necessary.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map\n  - The direct caller of metal_virt2phys (from the provided callgraph). To decide if metal_virt2phys (or parts of it) are live you must inspect call sites: when/how it is called, whether callers pass addresses that make branches reachable, or whether the whole function can be removed without affecting behaviour.\n\n- metal_shmem_open\n  - Caller of metal_shmem_try_map in the call chain. The broader call chain may determine whether metal_virt2phys is ever invoked in deployed configurations; include this symbol to trace reachability and observable effects across callers.\n\nNotes: Types like off_t, uint64_t and local variable entry are local details; they do not by themselves affect whether code is dead, so they are not listed as separate external symbols. The listed symbols provide the necessary external state, callers and side-effecting functions/macros that must be inspected to determine if any executed operations in metal_virt2phys could be removed without changing program behaviour."
