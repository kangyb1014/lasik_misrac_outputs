  "explanation": "To decide whether the parameter void *addr in metal_virt2phys can/should be const-qualified, the analyzer needs just enough surrounding information to know (a) how addr is used inside the call chain and (b) what callers pass so that changing the callee's signature would be safe.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map (prototype and call site(s)): This is the direct caller listed in the static call graph. We must inspect its source and the exact call site(s) to see what object it passes as addr and whether that caller expects to pass a modifiable pointer (i.e., whether it later modifies the same object or relies on a non-const parameter). If the caller only passes a pointer for inspection, metal_virt2phys could accept const void *.\n\n- _metal (global variable declaration / struct type, including pagemap_fd and page_shift fields): The function reads _metal.page_shift and _metal.pagemap_fd. The struct definition confirms types (signed/unsigned) and shows there is no aliasing through _metal that would require addr to be non-const. Also ensures page_shift type for the shift operation is known.\n\n- uintptr_t (typedef / stdint.h include): The function casts addr to uintptr_t. The typedef is required to confirm the semantics of the pointer-to-integer cast and to verify that casting a const-qualified pointer to uintptr_t (if changing to const void *) does not introduce constraint or portability issues relevant to MISRA analysis.\n\n- uint64_t (typedef / stdint.h include): entry is uint64_t; knowing its exact type ensures the bit-manipulation cause no hidden side-effects that might depend on addr being non-const (not directly related but verifies no aliasing with addr).\n\n- off_t (typedef / sys/types.h include): offset is computed from addr. Knowing off_t confirms the arithmetic and conversion from shifted pointer are well-defined and do not require addr to be modifiable.\n\n- Call sites of metal_virt2phys (if any outside the static call graph) / build-time symbol table: The static call graph provided lists a single caller, but a complete project scan or symbol table may reveal additional callers (e.g., via function pointer or conditional compilation). Any other callers must be checked to ensure they would tolerate a change to const void *addr.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine whether metal_virt2phys actually modifies the pointed-to object (it does not) and whether changing its prototype to take a const-qualified pointer would be compatible with all callers \u2014 the necessary facts to evaluate the MISRA rule about preferring const-qualified pointer types."
