  "explanation": "Only the call that uses strerror() is relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 because it invokes a function declared in <string.h>. No other calls to the standard <string.h> functions listed or similar (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the function. The other library calls present (pread, metal_log) are not string.h functions and do not fit the rule. Pointer arithmetic and bit operations in this function do not involve string.h pointer parameters and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 21.17."
