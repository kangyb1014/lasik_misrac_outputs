  "explanation": "To determine whether this function (directly or indirectly) violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must see any direct uses of memcmp and any calls that might themselves call memcmp or perform string comparisons. Each symbol is required for the following reason:\n\n- memcmp: the rule targets this function. You must know whether memcmp is referenced (directly in this function or indirectly via inlined/called code).\n- metal_log: the function calls metal_log. metal_log may internally use string-comparison routines (including memcmp). You must inspect metal_log implementation to ensure it does not call memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: the log-level macro/constant may select different logging code paths or formatting helpers; you must see the resolved logging code to check for memcmp usage.\n- memcpy: present in the function and easily confused with memcmp. Include it to verify no accidental use of memcmp instead of memcpy and to inspect any wrappers/macros that might alias to memcmp.\n- __func__: this function name string is passed to metal_log as a %s; you must know its type (null-terminated C string) to check whether any called function compares it with memcmp.\n- ldev->dev_name: passed to metal_log as %s; you must know its type/representation (null-terminated string or otherwise) so that any comparison of it via memcmp would be a MISRA violation.\n- struct linux_device: to locate the declaration of dev_name and the nested device field (regions/num_regions) so you can determine types of dev_name and confirm whether any comparisons would involve null-terminated strings.\n- struct metal_sg: to know the type of sg_in[].virt and sg_in[].len (e.g., char * vs void *) and confirm that pointer arithmetic is on addresses not string data, and to rule out memcmp use on those fields.\n- struct metal_io_region: to know types of io->virt and io->size (again to confirm they are memory addresses/sizes and not string buffers that could be compared with memcmp).\n- EINVAL: the error macro returned; include to resolve return values and to ensure no hidden macro expands to code that uses memcmp.\n\nProviding these symbols (implementations or declarations) lets the analyzer determine whether memcmp is used anywhere in the target function's body or in any functions it calls with null-terminated string operands, and thus whether the MISRA rule is violated."
