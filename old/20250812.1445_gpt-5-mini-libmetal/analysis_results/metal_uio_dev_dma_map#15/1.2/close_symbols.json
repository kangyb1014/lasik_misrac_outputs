  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses language/compiler extensions (MISRA rule about disallowing language extensions), the next analyzer needs the following symbol definitions and why each is required:\n\n- struct metal_sg: The function reads sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len and later does arithmetic with vaddr_sg_lo (assigned from sg_in[i].virt). Whether pointer arithmetic on that member is a language extension depends on the declared type of 'virt' (e.g., void * vs char * vs uintptr_t) and the type of 'len' (size_t, int, etc.). The exact member types are required to decide if the code relies on a compiler extension (notably arithmetic on void*).\n\n- struct metal_io_region: The function reads io->virt and io->size and uses vaddr_lo + io->size. The declared types of these members determine whether pointer arithmetic is standard or an extension. The definition is needed to check for void* arithmetic or implicit pointer/integer conversions.\n\n- struct linux_device (including inner 'device' member: regions, num_regions): The loop uses ldev->device.regions and ldev->device.num_regions. Knowing the type of 'regions' (pointer to what) and 'num_regions' (type width) is necessary to validate pointer comparisons and any casts ((int)ldev->device.num_regions) that could hide non\u2011standard behavior or reliance on extension behavior.\n\n- metal_log (function or macro) and METAL_LOG_WARNING: metal_log is invoked with a format string and arguments (including __func__ and vaddr_sg_lo). If metal_log is a macro or uses compiler-specific variadic macro extensions or attributes, that could be a language extension. Also the call passes a void* to a \"%x\" format \u2014 determining whether that is masked or adapted by metal_log requires its definition.\n\n- memcpy (from <string.h>): The function calls memcpy(sg_out, sg_in, ...). While memcpy is standard, an implementation might be a builtin or macro using extensions. The prototype also confirms types of the parameters to check for implicit conversions that might invoke extensions.\n\n- EINVAL (errno macro): The code returns -EINVAL. EINVAL is a macro; its definition matters (e.g., if it's an enum constant, macro, or something nonstandard). Knowing its definition rules out any extension usage here.\n\n- __func__: The function uses __func__ in the log. __func__ is standardized in C99 but some compilers provide different behavior as an extension. Knowing whether the project targets a C standard where __func__ is standard or if the compiler provides it as an extension helps decide compliance.\n\n- uint32_t (from <stdint.h>): Present in the parameter list. Confirming its definition and included standard header ensures no nonstandard typedef/extension is being used for the width-guaranteed integer type.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to check the main suspicious constructs in the function for language-extension usage: pointer arithmetic performed on void* (or other non-standard pointer arithmetic), implicit pointer/integer conversions, and any macros/variadic/log helpers that might rely on compiler-specific extensions. Other standard operators (sizeof, casts, memcpy) are less likely to be extensions but are included to be thorough."
