  "explanation": "List of required symbols and why they matter for checking the MISRA rule (a function parameter shall not be modified):\n\n- struct metal_sg: The code indexes sg_in/sg_out and reads fields (virt, len). To determine whether the pointer parameters sg_in/sg_out themselves are modified or only the objects they point to, you must know this type's layout and whether accessing its fields could imply indirect pointer assignment.\n\n- struct linux_device: The function dereferences ldev to access ldev->device.num_regions and ldev->device.regions and ldev->dev_name. Knowing this structure (and types of its members) is necessary to confirm these are read accesses only and that no assignments to the ldev parameter occur.\n\n- struct linux_bus: The lbus parameter is cast away ((void)lbus). Having the definition confirms there are no hidden macros/side effects that could modify the parameter.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: The loop reads io->virt and io->size. Its definition shows these are ordinary fields (addresses/sizes) so accesses are reads and not pointer assignments that would modify the ldev parameter.\n\n- memcpy: The call memcpy(sg_out, sg_in, ...) writes to the memory pointed to by sg_out (allowed by MISRA), but you must inspect the prototype/behavior to confirm memcpy does not modify the pointer variable sg_out itself (it does not) and only writes the pointee memory.\n\n- metal_log: The function is invoked when an error is detected. To be sure this call does not modify any of the function parameters (for example via pointer arguments or global side effects that reassign parameters), its prototype/behavior should be known.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: The logging level macro used with metal_log; include to inspect metal_log invocation semantics if it expands to something that could modify parameters or have side effects.\n\n- EINVAL: The error macro/constant returned (-EINVAL) is part of the return expression; include to confirm it is a plain error code and not a macro that could cause parameter modification.\n\nWith these symbols available, an analyzer can determine that only the objects pointed to by pointer parameters are written (via memcpy and memory accesses) and that none of the pointer parameters themselves are reassigned or modified by functions/macros used here."
