  "explanation": "Only the memcpy call uses a Standard Library string.h function and therefore must be checked for potential out-of-bounds accesses. In addition, the subsequent loop indexes sg_out with i up to nents_in and thus should be inspected together with the memcpy usage to ensure the destination/source buffers and the element count are consistent and safe. Other fragments (variable declarations, (void) casts for bus/device, the return statement, and the calls to metal_cache_flush/metal_cache_invalidate themselves) are not string.h functions and therefore are not directly subject to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17; they do not by themselves invoke the standard string handling routines that this rule covers."
