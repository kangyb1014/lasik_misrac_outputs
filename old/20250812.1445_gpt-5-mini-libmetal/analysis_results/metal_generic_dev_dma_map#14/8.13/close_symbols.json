  "explanation": "- struct metal_sg: needed to know the types and const-qualification of its members (especially the type of virt and whether any members are modifiable). Determining whether sg_in can be declared as const (and whether sg_out must be non-const) requires the full definition of struct metal_sg.\\n- metal_cache_flush: its prototype (parameter types) is required to know whether passing sg_out[i].virt requires a non-const pointer (e.g. void * vs const void *). If the function requires a non-const pointer, that can influence whether related pointers/fields may need to be non-const.\\n- metal_cache_invalidate: same reason as metal_cache_flush \u2014 its parameter types determine whether the code forces non-const pointer usage for the virt field and therefore may prevent const-qualification of related pointers.\\n- memcpy: the standard prototype (dest: void *, src: const void *, size_t) shows sg_in is only read as a source. Confirming memcpy's signature supports qualifying sg_in as const.\\n- struct metal_bus and struct metal_device: their definitions are required to determine whether bus and device pointer parameters could/should be const (they are unused here, but MISRA asks that pointers be const-qualified whenever possible).\\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_W: included so the meaning/type of the macro/enum is known; while not directly about const, it completes the control-flow context to confirm that only sg_out (not sg_in) is acted upon in the conditional path.\\n\nThese symbols collectively allow a precise determination of whether any pointer parameters (sg_in, sg_out, bus, device, or members like virt) could or must be const-qualified without breaking calls to memcpy or the cache functions, which is needed to assess compliance with the MISRA rule."
