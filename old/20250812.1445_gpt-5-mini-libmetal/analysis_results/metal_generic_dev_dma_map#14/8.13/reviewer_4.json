  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 R.8.13 requires that pointers should be to const-qualified types whenever possible. In the provided code the parameters 'bus' and 'device' are merely cast to void and never modified or passed to APIs that require a non-const pointer, so they could and therefore should be declared as 'const struct metal_bus *' and 'const struct metal_device *' (unless the function must match an external non-const API/signature). Additionally, 'sg_in' is only read (used as the source to memcpy) and could be declared 'const struct metal_sg *sg_in' because memcpy takes a const void *src; only 'sg_out' must remain non-const as it is written to. The test-probe/logging code does not change this analysis. If this function is required to match an existing non-const API (callback or public API), then keeping non-const is justified as an exception; absent that justification the report is correct."
