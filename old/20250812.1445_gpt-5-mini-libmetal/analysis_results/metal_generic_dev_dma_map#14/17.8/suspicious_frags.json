  "explanation": "I found no code fragments that modify the function parameters themselves. Specifically:\n- There are no assignments to any parameter variables (no statements like sg_out = ..., sg_in = ..., dir = ..., bus = ..., device = ..., or nents_in = ...).\n- There is no pointer arithmetic on the pointer parameters (no increments/decrements or index-pointer reassignment that would change the pointer variable).\n- The memcpy call copies the objects pointed to by sg_in into the objects pointed to by sg_out; modifying the objects pointed to by a pointer parameter is allowed by Rule 17.8 (only changing the pointer parameter itself is disallowed).\n- The loop writes to sg_out[i].virt and sg_out[i].len and calls cache functions on those addresses; these modify the objects referenced by the pointer parameter (permitted), not the pointer parameter itself.\n- The (void)bus and (void)device lines merely mark parameters as unused and do not modify them.\n- The dir parameter is only compared (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) and not assigned to.\n\nTherefore, there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in the provided function."
