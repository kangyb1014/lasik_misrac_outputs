  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_dma_map(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t     uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t     int nents_in,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_out)\n{\n\tint i;\n\t(void)bus;\n\t(void)device;\n\n\tif (sg_out != sg_in)\n\t\tmemcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg)));\n\tfor (i = 0; i < nents_in; i++) {\n\t\tif (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) {\n\t\t\tmetal_cache_flush(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetal_cache_invalidate(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t}\n\n\treturn nents_in;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\n#define METAL_DMA_DEV_W 2\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (sg_out != sg_in)\n\t\tmemcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg)));\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The memcpy is executed only when sg_out != sg_in; it copies the scatter-gather entries so the subsequent cache flush/invalidate operate on the correct entries. If memcpy were removed and sg_out did not already contain the same entries as sg_in, the behavior would change (cache operations would act on stale or uninitialised data). Therefore this operation is not dead code."
