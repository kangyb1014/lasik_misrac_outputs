  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments are not reported because they perform essential control or observable behaviour and therefore are unlikely to be dead code: the function signature and parameter list are required; the local variable declaration (int i;) is used by the loop; the loop header (for (i = 0; i < nents_in; i++)) drives per-entry processing; the memcpy (when not skipped) copies data between provided buffers \u2014 an observable side effect; and the final return nents_in returns a value used by callers. The conditional check (sg_out != sg_in) is a necessary guard to avoid undefined behavior when copying overlapping/identical buffers. These operations have clear potential effects on program behaviour and so are not considered dead code for Rule 2.2 without further context."
