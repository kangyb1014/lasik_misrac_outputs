  "explanation": "I examined the function for compiler-specific language extensions documented as extensions (e.g. gcc/clang __attribute__ or __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ }), nested functions, labels-as-values, __builtin_* intrinsics used as language extensions, __extension__ keyword, inline asm, nonstandard storage-class or function qualifiers, or compiler-specific keywords). None of these appear in the provided code. The code uses only standard C constructs: function definition, standard integer type uint32_t, pointer and struct types, (void) casts to silence unused-parameter warnings, memcpy and calls to other functions, a standard for loop and standard arithmetic. No GNU/C or other compiler extensions are present in the snippet, so there are no fragments that need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
