  "explanation": "I only flagged expressions that involve pointers to data that appear to be read-only (string name and the bus object address) and therefore should be checked to see whether the pointee could be const-qualified. Other parts of the function do not present the same concern: the numeric check comparing device->num_regions to METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS and the return of -EINVAL are not pointer-qualification issues; the call that inserts the device node into the generic_device_list is an operation that modifies the list/node state (so its pointer parameters are expected to be non-const); and the function takes a non-const struct metal_device* because the function logically updates the device state. These remaining fragments therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. "
