  "explanation": "I found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code. The only string-related operation is strlen(device->name) used to check for an empty name; this does not compare null-terminated strings with memcmp. Other operations are pointer checks, integer comparisons, assignments, and a list insertion, none of which involve memcmp or violate Rule 21.14. Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that need investigation for Rule 21.14."
