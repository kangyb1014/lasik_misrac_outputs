  "explanation": "- strlen: The target calls strlen(device->name). Inspecting strlen implementation (or its wrapper in this codebase) is necessary to confirm it does not internally use memcmp to process/verify the NUL-terminated string (which would be a direct MISRA violation if it compared NUL-terminated strings with memcmp).\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule is about use of memcmp for null-terminated strings. The analysis must locate any use of memcmp reachable from the target (directly or in called functions). Providing memcmp allows the next agent to check its implementation and usages.\n- metal_list_add_tail: This is the only function called by the target. Its implementation must be checked to ensure it (or functions it calls) does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings (for example, comparing device->name or other NUL-terminated strings).\n- struct metal_device (definition): The target accesses device->name. The struct definition is required to confirm the type of name (e.g., char * or array) and whether it is intended/guaranteed to be a NUL-terminated string; this determines whether any memcmp usage involving that field would be comparing null-terminated strings and thus violate the rule."
