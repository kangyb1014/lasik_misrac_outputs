  "explanation": "No code fragments that modify the function parameter pointer itself were found. In metal_register_generic_device the identifier \"device\" is never assigned to or incremented; it is only dereferenced to access or modify the object it points to (e.g. device->bus = &metal_generic_bus and reading device->name, device->num_regions, device->node). Dereferencing and modifying the pointed-to object is allowed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. Passing &device->node to metal_list_add_tail takes the address of a member and does not reassign the parameter pointer. The condition checks (using device->name, strlen, device->num_regions) only read fields and do not alter the pointer itself. The related definitions (struct metal_device, metal_generic_bus, METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS) are declarations/initializers and do not change the parameter variable. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation for this rule."
