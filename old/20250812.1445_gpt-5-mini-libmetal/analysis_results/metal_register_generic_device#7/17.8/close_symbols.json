  "explanation": "- struct metal_device: Needed to see the exact fields (name, num_regions, bus, node) and confirm that assignments (device->bus) and accesses (device->name, device->num_regions, device->node) modify the pointed-to object, not the pointer parameter itself.\\n- struct metal_bus (or the type of device->bus): Needed to confirm the type of device->bus and that assigning &metal_generic_bus is an assignment to a member of *device rather than reassigning the parameter variable.\\n- struct metal_list (type of device->node): Needed to determine what metal_list_add_tail does to the node member (it will show that it modifies members of the object pointed to, not the pointer parameter).\\n- metal_list_add_tail (declaration/implementation): Required to verify the function signature and body to ensure it does not attempt to modify the caller's local pointer variable 'device' (it should only modify the node structure passed by address).\\n- metal_generic_bus: Needed so the analyser can inspect this object (and its type) to confirm &metal_generic_bus is a pointer to an object assigned into a member, not a reassignment of the parameter.\\n- METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS: Needed to confirm this is a compile-time constant/macro used only in the comparison and that it does not involve any side-effect that could mutate the parameter.\\n- strlen (declaration): Required to confirm that calling strlen(device->name) only reads through the pointed-to string and does not modify the pointer parameter.\\n- EINVAL (macro): Included to confirm the error return value has no side effects on the parameter; ensures the return path does not modify the parameter."
