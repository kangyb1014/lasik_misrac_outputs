  "explanation": "For checking language-extension usage you must inspect the declarations/definitions referenced by the function (not just its body). Each symbol below is required because its declaration or definition can hide compiler-specific extensions (attributes, nonstandard builtins, macros, or non\u2011standard types) that would violate the MISRA rule:\n\n- struct linux_bus: need the struct definition to ensure it does not use compiler extensions (bit\u2011fields with implementation-defined widths, unnamed/anonymous members, flexible-array/zero-length arrays used as extension, or __attribute__ on members).\n\n- struct linux_driver: the function accesses ldrv->sdrv, ldrv->drv_name and ldrv->mod_name; the struct definition must be checked for nonstandard constructs (anonymous unions/structs, GCC extensions, attribute annotations) and to confirm the member types are standard (e.g., char * vs some compiler-specific type).\n\n- sysfs_open_driver: this project function is called three times; its prototype/definition must be inspected for compiler extensions (attribute((...)), inline asm, nonportable calling conventions, macros replacing it with compiler builtins).\n\n- snprintf: standard C library function, but some platforms provide nonstandard variants or macros; check its declaration/compat wrapper for extensions or nonstandard prototypes.\n\n- system: same as snprintf \u2014 inspect the declaration/wrapper for any nonstandard implementation or extension macros.\n\n- metal_log: project logging function; its declaration may use compiler-specific extensions (variadic macros, GCC attributes, builtin functions) or macros that expand to extensions \u2014 must be checked.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: macro or enum used as a log level; inspect its definition in case it is a macro that expands to compiler-specific constructs.\n\n- __func__: implementation-provided identifier; although standard in C99, older compilers or platform headers may provide it as an extension or via macro shimming \u2014 check how it is defined/handled in the build environment.\n\n- EOVERFLOW and ENODEV: errno macros from system headers; examine their definitions/headers in the project/environment to ensure they are standard macros and that any wrapper headers do not introduce compiler-specific extensions.\n\nBy providing the above symbols (their prototypes/definitions and the headers or wrappers that declare them), the next analyser can detect any use of compiler-documented language extensions (attributes, inline assembly, nonstandard keywords/macros, or other extension constructs) that would violate the MISRA rule."
