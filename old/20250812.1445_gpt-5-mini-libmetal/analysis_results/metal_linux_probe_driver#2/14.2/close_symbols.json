Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Summary: The target function contains no for statements, so at source level it cannot directly violate the MISRA rule. To be conservative and complete, the following symbols must be inspected because the MISRA for-loop rule treats the behaviour of a for-loop body as including any functions/macros called inside that loop and because macros/inline functions or side-effects on objects used as loop counters could change the analysis.\n\nWhy each symbol is required:\n- sysfs_open_driver: called three times in the function. If this symbol is a macro or an inline function that contains a for loop or modifies objects that could serve as a loop counter, that could affect a for-loop analysis (if a for were present). Also it may have side effects on driver state used elsewhere.\n- snprintf: a library function that could be implemented as a macro on some platforms; if it expands to code containing a for loop or modifies objects with persistent side-effects, that would be relevant when checking for-loop body behaviour.\n- system: called to run shell commands; inspect its declaration/implementation (or macro wrapper) to ensure it does not expand to code with a for loop or side-effects that would matter.\n- metal_log: logging call that might be a macro wrapping code; a macro could expand to a loop or modify global/state used as loop counters; must be checked.\n- struct linux_bus: type of lbus; need its definition to confirm whether passing lbus->bus_name might alias or be an object that could be modified by called functions (relevant if a for loop used that object as a counter/flag).\n- struct linux_driver: type of ldrv; need its definition to see the types of sdrv/mod_name/drv_name (e.g. whether any are volatile or macros) and whether any are manipulated by called functions (relevant to loop-counter/side-effect rules).\n- ldrv->sdrv: the field being read/updated; if this field were also used as a loop counter elsewhere or modified by called functions, it could affect for-loop well-formedness analysis.\n- ldrv->mod_name: string passed to snprintf/system; if this is computed via macros or accessors that have side effects, that matters when reasoning about expressions in for clauses.\n- ldrv->drv_name: likewise for driver name used in sysfs_open_driver.\n- lbus->bus_name: parameter passed to sysfs_open_driver; inspect for aliasing/side-effects.\n- EOVERFLOW: error macro used in return; include to fully understand control-flow/returns (not directly about for loops but needed for complete control-flow reasoning).\n- ENODEV: error macro used in return; same reason as above.\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: logging level macro; included because metal_log may be a macro using it and might expand to code with loops or side-effects.\n- __func__: function-name identifier used in logging; inspect any macro wrappers that use it.\n\nPractical note: In this specific function there are no for loops in the source, so at face value MISRA rule \"A for loop shall be well-formed\" is not violated. The listed symbols are provided only so a follow-up agent can verify there are no hidden/inline/macro expansions in called symbols that would introduce a for loop or side-effects relevant to for-loop well-formedness."
