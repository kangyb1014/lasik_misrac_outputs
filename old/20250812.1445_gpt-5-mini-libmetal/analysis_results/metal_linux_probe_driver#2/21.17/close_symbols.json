  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed to determine potential out\u2011of\u2011bounds string accesses:\n\n- struct linux_driver (definition)\n  - Needed to know the types and storage of ldrv->mod_name and ldrv->drv_name (e.g. char * vs char[N], and any documented maximum lengths). Whether these members are guaranteed to be NUL\u2011terminated directly determines whether snprintf(\"%s\") can read beyond the object bounds.\n\n- struct linux_bus (definition)\n  - Needed to know the type and storage of lbus->bus_name (passed to sysfs_open_driver) and whether it is a NUL\u2011terminated string or a fixed buffer; this helps assess any string reads performed by sysfs_open_driver or related functions.\n\n- sysfs_open_driver (prototype/implementation)\n  - Although not a standard string function, sysfs_open_driver may internally read drv_name/bus_name. Its implementation or contract can show whether it requires NUL\u2011terminated strings or could cause reads past provided buffers, and whether it modifies/validates those strings.\n\n- snprintf (C library semantics/prototype)\n  - The code uses snprintf to compose command and then checks the return value against sizeof(command). Precise semantics (return value meaning on truncation and negative error returns) are required to judge whether the truncation check is correct and thus whether an out\u2011of\u2011bounds write into command is possible.\n\n- system (C library prototype)\n  - system reads the composed command string. While it does not affect bounds directly, confirming its prototype and behavior is useful to ensure command is used only as a C string after snprintf and that no other operations could cause buffer overruns.\n\n- metal_log (prototype) and METAL_LOG_WARNING macro\n  - metal_log is called with command (and __func__). If metal_log formats or copies those strings in a nonstandard way, it could introduce additional string reads or writes; knowing its prototype/behavior ensures no hidden string operations cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n\n- Initializers/assignment sites for linux_driver.mod_name, linux_driver.drv_name, linux_bus.bus_name\n  - Knowing where and how those members are populated (constructors, registration functions, static initializers, strncpy/strcpy usage elsewhere) is essential to determine whether they are valid NUL\u2011terminated strings and whether their source code already uses safe string functions. If those sources guarantee NUL termination or maximum lengths, snprintf(\"%s\") is safe; otherwise it may read past the object bounds.\n\nNotes:\n- The MISRA rule cited specifically targets functions from <string.h>. This function does not call those directly, but uses snprintf with %s which reads external strings; the safety question reduces to whether those input strings are NUL\u2011terminated and sized appropriately. The symbols above provide the necessary information to decide that.\n- Other symbols in the file (EOVERFLOW, ENODEV, __func__) are not required to assess string bounds safety and are therefore omitted."
