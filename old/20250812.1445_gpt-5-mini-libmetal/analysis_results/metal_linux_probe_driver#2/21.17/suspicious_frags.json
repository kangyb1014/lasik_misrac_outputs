  "explanation": "No calls to the Standard Library string handling functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) appear in the provided code. The only string formatting/writing operation is snprintf(command, sizeof(command), ...). That use checks the snprintf return value against sizeof(command) and returns -EOVERFLOW if the required buffer size is >= sizeof(command), which prevents writes beyond the bounds of command. Other functions (system, sysfs_open_driver, metal_log) are not part of <string.h> and do not perform the string operations covered by Rule 21.17 in this fragment. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 21.17 in this code."
