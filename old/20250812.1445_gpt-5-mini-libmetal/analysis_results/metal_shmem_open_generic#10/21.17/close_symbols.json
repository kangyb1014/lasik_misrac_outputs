  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each required symbol\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem\n  - Needed to know the type and storage of the member shmem->name (is it a pointer, fixed-size array, where the buffer lives, and whether it is guaranteed NUL-terminated). This determines whether passing shmem->name to strcmp can read beyond the object bounds.\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - Included because metal_generic_shmem contains a member io of this type. Knowing its layout isn\u2019t directly required for strcmp bounds, but the code uses metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io) to gate returning the region; understanding struct lifetime and allocation helps ensure shmem instances (and thus shmem->name) remain valid while iterating.\n\n- metal_io_region_size\n  - The function is called in the loop; its behavior and whether it can modify or validate the shmem object or have side-effects that affect validity of shmem->name may be relevant to overall correctness and lifetime assumptions.\n\n- struct metal_list\n  - The list node type stored in the generic_shmem_list and embedded in metal_generic_shmem. Knowing its layout and maintenance (e.g. list head/tail pointers) is necessary to ensure list traversal yields valid shmem pointers (so strcmp is invoked on live objects).\n\n- _metal.common.generic_shmem_list (the global list head)\n  - To inspect how the list is initialized and maintained (empty list sentinel, invariants). This affects whether the iteration can produce invalid nodes or transient entries whose name pointers are invalid.\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro)\n  - The exact iteration semantics determine what 'node' points to and when it is valid. If the macro uses raw pointer arithmetic or transient locking, it could affect whether shmem->name is safe to read.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro)\n  - To be sure the container_of computation is correct for deriving struct metal_generic_shmem * from the list node and does not introduce undefined pointer arithmetic that could yield an invalid name pointer.\n\n- strcmp (from <string.h>)\n  - The rule being checked applies to standard string functions. Knowing which strcmp implementation/contract is used (expects NUL-terminated strings and will read until NUL) makes it clear that both operands must point to valid NUL-terminated buffers whose accessible memory bounds must not be exceeded.\n\n- All functions/routines that allocate or initialize struct metal_generic_shmem instances (shmem registration/creation)\n  - You must inspect where shmem objects are created and how their name fields are set (copied, pointed-to, allocated length, NUL-termination guarantees). This is essential to determine if strcmp(shmem->name, name) can over-read shmem->name.\n\n- Callers that pass the 'name' argument to metal_shmem_open_generic (e.g. metal_shmem_open)\n  - strcmp reads both operands. To ensure no out-of-bounds access you must know how the caller constructs the 'name' argument (pointer validity, lifetime, and NUL-termination). Inspecting caller code (metal_shmem_open and its callers) verifies whether the provided name is safe for strcmp.\n\nTogether, these symbols let an analyst determine (1) whether shmem->name and the incoming name are valid, NUL-terminated character sequences, (2) whether iteration and container-of produce valid pointers to these buffers at the time of strcmp, and thus (3) whether strcmp can cause out-of-bounds accesses in violation of the MISRA rule."
