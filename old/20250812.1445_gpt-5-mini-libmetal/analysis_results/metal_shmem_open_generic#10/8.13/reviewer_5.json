  "explanation": "Not correct. Although the local variable 'node' is only read during traversal, qualifying it as 'const struct metal_list *' is not generically possible here without changing surrounding APIs or casting away const. The code uses metal_container_of(node, struct metal_generic_shmem, node) to obtain a non-const struct metal_generic_shmem * (assigned to 'shmem') and later returns &shmem->io as a non-const metal_io_region *. If 'node' were made a pointer-to-const, that constness would propagate to the containing object (or require casting away qualifiers), or force 'shmem' and the returned io pointer to become const \u2014 which would break types or require discarding const. MISRA\u2019s Rule 8.13 requires const qualification only \u201cwhenever possible\u201d; in this context it is not possible without changing the container/iteration macros or the API surface. Therefore the reported violation is not correct."
