  "explanation": "To decide whether pointers in metal_shmem_open_generic should be more const-qualified under MISRA (\"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\"), the analyzer must know: \n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem (definition): shows types of the fields used here (shmem->name and shmem->io). Needed to determine whether shmem->name is const-qualified and whether shmem->io is a mutable or conceptually read-only object (i.e., whether the function returns a pointer to data that should be const).\n\n- struct metal_io_region (definition): needed to determine whether the io object can/should be exposed via a const pointer (i.e., whether its API is read-only or allows modification). This decides if result should be 'const struct metal_io_region *' (or pointer-to-const) instead of non-const.\n\n- metal_io_region_size (prototype/signature): its parameter const-qualification indicates whether API authors treat metal_io_region as const (e.g., takes const struct metal_io_region *). That is relevant evidence that returned regions can be const.\n\n- metal_shmem_open (definition and call sites): metal_shmem_open is the direct caller of metal_shmem_open_generic (per the static graph). The analyzer must inspect how callers use the returned *result (do they modify the region through the pointer?). If callers modify the region, making the pointed-to type const would be incorrect.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map (definition/prototype) and metal_open (definition/prototype): metal_shmem_open calls these functions (per the static graph). They may accept or modify struct metal_io_region pointers; their signatures and bodies indicate whether the region returned by metal_shmem_open_generic must be mutable. Include their prototypes/definitions to check const requirements.\n\n- _metal.common.generic_shmem_list (declaration/element type): to confirm the ownership/lifetime and whether elements on the list are intended to be immutable or mutable, which affects whether the returned pointer should be const.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro/definition) and metal_list_for_each (macro/definition): these macros show how the node is cast to struct metal_generic_shmem *. They are needed to confirm there is no const-qualification lost or enforced during iteration/casting that would affect pointer constness.\n\nCollecting these symbols (type definitions, prototypes, and the caller/usage sites) lets the next agent determine whether the returned metal_io_region pointer can/should be const according to MISRA, by checking all uses and API conventions for mutability."
