  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 requires pointer types to be const-qualified when the pointed-to object is not modified. In metal_shmem_open_generic the member shmem->name is only read (used in strcmp and logging), so it is an ideal candidate to be declared const char * in the struct.\n\nTherefore the agent A's report is correct in essence: if struct metal_generic_shmem defines name as a non-const pointer (e.g. char *name) then that declaration would violate Rule 8.13 (because the object is only accessed read-only and should be declared const-qualified). If the member is already declared const char * there is no violation here.\n\nCaveat: confirming a real MISRA violation requires whole-program analysis \u2014 if other code legitimately modifies the string through that member then it must remain non-const. Also note that passing a char * to strcmp (which expects const char *) is allowed by C and will not produce a compiler error; the rule concerns the declaration, not the call semantics. The test logging supplied does not change this conclusion."
