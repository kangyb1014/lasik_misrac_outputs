  "explanation": "No use of memcmp appears in the provided code. The only string comparison is: if (strcmp(shmem->name, name) != 0) which uses strcmp (appropriate for null-terminated strings) rather than memcmp. The other fragments (struct definition, metal_container_of, metal_list_for_each, and the loop/body logic) do not call memcmp or perform raw memory comparisons of null-terminated strings, so they are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 and do not require investigation for this rule."
