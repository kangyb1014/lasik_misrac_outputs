  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. The function and struct use only standard C constructs and standard library identifiers (strlen, NULL) and common errno macros (EINVAL, EEXIST). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __asm__, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, extended inline assembly, or other documented compiler-specific keywords or built-ins. The metal_list_* and metal_log identifiers appear to be library/application functions or macros but are not compiler extensions themselves (their implementations were not provided). Therefore there are no code fragments here that require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
