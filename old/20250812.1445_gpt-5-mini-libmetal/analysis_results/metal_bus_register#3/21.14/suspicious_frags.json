  "explanation": "I inspected the target function metal_bus_register and the related function metal_bus_find. There are no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp in the provided code. The code uses strlen to check for an empty name and strcmp to compare null-terminated strings; those are appropriate for NUL-terminated C strings and do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically forbids memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings). No other fragments in the provided code use memcmp or perform byte-wise comparisons of NUL-terminated strings, so there are no suspicious fragments to report for this rule."
