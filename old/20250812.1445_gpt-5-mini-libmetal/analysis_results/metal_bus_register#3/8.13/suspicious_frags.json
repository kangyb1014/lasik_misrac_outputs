  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers could be const-qualified. The only pointer usages here that should be investigated are the uses of bus->name passed to functions that take (or logically should take) const-qualified char pointers (strlen, metal_bus_find, and formatted logging). These occurrences may indicate that the member bus->name could be declared as const char * and should be checked.\n\nOther fragments do not need investigation under Rule 8.13: the function parameter struct metal_bus *bus and subsequent calls that modify bus contents (metal_list_init(&bus->devices); metal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.bus_list, &bus->node);) necessarily require a mutable bus pointer and mutable members, so const qualification would be inappropriate. The null check on bus (!bus) is a runtime validation, not a const-related issue. The string literal \"registered %s bus\\n\" is a literal used as a format string and not a candidate for changing pointer constness in this context."
