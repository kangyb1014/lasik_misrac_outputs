Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "You must examine the implementations and data types used by the three callees because MISRA rule about well-formed for loops requires checking any for loops that occur in those functions and whether their loop clauses or bodies violate the rule. Specifically:\n\n- metal_bus_find (function implementation): Needed to locate any for loops inside this function, to check the three clauses (initialization, condition, iteration) and whether the loop counter or loop-controlled objects are modified in the body or by any functions the loop body calls.\n\n- metal_list_init (function implementation): Although often simple, it may contain loops (or call helpers that do). The function body must be inspected for for-loops and whether they obey the rule (no side effects in condition, only one loop counter, counters not modified in body, etc.).\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (function implementation): Likely to traverse or update linked lists (common place for for loops). Its implementation must be inspected for any for-loops and for interactions with objects passed from metal_bus_register (bus->node, _metal.common.bus_list) that could violate the rule.\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition \u2014 fields: name, devices, node): Required to understand types of bus->devices and bus->node and whether the called list functions operate on objects that could be used in loop clauses or modified in loop bodies (e.g. if a for loop uses or modifies these fields).\n\n- struct/list types used by metal_list_* (e.g. struct metal_list, list node struct) \u2014 definitions: The internal representation of lists (and any counters/indices) is required to see how metal_list_init/add_tail manipulate list fields and whether any for-loops inside them use or modify objects that would violate the MISRA constraints.\n\n- _metal (global) and its type (definition of .common.bus_list): metal_list_add_tail is called with &_metal.common.bus_list; you must inspect the global list object layout and any for-loops that traverse or modify this global to determine if loop counters or other objects used in loop clauses are modified improperly.\n\n(Only these symbols are required because the static call graph shows no further callees; if any of these functions call other functions you discover during inspection, those additional functions and the types they touch would also need to be included.)"
