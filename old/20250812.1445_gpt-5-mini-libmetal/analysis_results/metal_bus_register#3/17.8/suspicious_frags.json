  "explanation": "Rule 17.8 forbids modifying the function parameter variable itself (reassigning the pointer). In this function there is no assignment to the parameter 'bus' (no statements like 'bus = ...'), so the pointer itself is not modified. The usages in the body are either read-only checks (if (!bus || !bus->name || !strlen(bus->name))) or pass the addresses of members (&bus->devices, &bus->node) to helper functions. Modifying the object pointed-to by a pointer parameter is permitted by the rule, so calls that initialize or link members of *bus (metal_list_init, metal_list_add_tail) do not violate Rule 17.8. Similarly, passing bus->name to strlen or to metal_bus_find is a read access (and passing NULL for the second parameter does not reassign the bus parameter). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that warrant investigation for Rule 17.8."
