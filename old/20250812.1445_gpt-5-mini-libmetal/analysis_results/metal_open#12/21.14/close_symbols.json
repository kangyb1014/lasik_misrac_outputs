  "explanation": "strlen \u2014 The target uses strlen(path); include its declaration/definition to confirm it is not a macro or wrapper that expands to memcmp (which would trigger the MISRA violation). memcmp \u2014 The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp on null-terminated strings; include this symbol so the analyzer can detect any direct or macro-expanded use inside the target function. open \u2014 The target may call open(path,...); include to check whether open is a plain library call or a macro/wrapper that might use memcmp on path. shm_open \u2014 Same reason as open: target calls shm_open when shm flag set; include to detect any hidden memcmp use in a macro/wrapper. errno \u2014 The return value is computed from errno on error; include to ensure errno is the standard variable and not a macro that could hide memcmp use. EINVAL \u2014 Used as a returned error code in the target; include to confirm it is a constant macro and not an expression that could expand to memcmp. O_RDWR, O_CREAT, O_CLOEXEC, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR \u2014 File-mode/flag macros used in calls; include them to check they are simple constants and not macros that expand to function calls (e.g., to memcmp). metal_uio_dev_open, metal_shmem_open \u2014 Callers of metal_open (from the provided call graph). Include the caller symbols so an interprocedural check can confirm that no caller passes data or invokes helper macros/functions that cause memcmp to be invoked indirectly as part of metal_open's execution (e.g., via wrapper macros or inlined helpers)."
