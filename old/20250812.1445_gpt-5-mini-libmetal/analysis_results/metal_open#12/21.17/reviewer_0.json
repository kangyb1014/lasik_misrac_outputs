  "explanation": "The report is correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 requires that uses of the <string.h> functions must not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. In metal_open the code calls strlen(path) after only a NULL check. If a caller passes a non-NULL pointer that does not point to a valid NUL-terminated string (or whose allocation does not contain a terminating '\\0' within its bounds), strlen may scan past the object boundary and thus induce an out-of-bounds access \u2014 exactly the situation Rule 21.17 forbids.\n\nWhether this is a practical fault depends on the API contract (open/shm_open expect NUL-terminated path strings), but MISRA requires that such uses be proven safe or guarded. Since metal_open does not ensure or prove that path is NUL-terminated within its allocation, the use of strlen here is a potential violation. Remediations include documenting and enforcing a precondition that path is a valid NUL-terminated string and ensuring callers can meet it, or using a bounded alternative (e.g. strnlen with a known maximum buffer size or checking termination with a provided length) so that no read can go beyond the object's bounds."
