  "explanation": "No code fragment modifies any function parameter. The parameters are: 'const char *path' and 'int shm'. The code only reads these parameters: it checks 'path' for NULL and emptiness via strlen(path) and uses 'path' as an argument to strlen(), shm_open(), or open() \u2014 all of which take a const char * and do not mutate the pointer or the pointed-to object here. The 'shm' integer parameter is only read in the conditional expression (shm ? ... : ...), not assigned or altered. There is no pointer arithmetic or assignment to 'path' (no path = ..., no ++path/--path), and no passing of the address of the parameters for modification. Therefore no fragments need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8."
