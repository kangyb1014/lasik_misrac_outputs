  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code. Specific reasoning:\n\n- The function metal_generic_dev_open uses only standard C constructs: function call, pointer operations, strcmp, return values. The (void)bus cast to silence an unused parameter is standard C.\n- The metal_list_for_each macro expands to a simple for loop (for ((node)=(list)->next; (node)!=(list); (node)=(node)->next)) \u2014 this is plain preprocessor usage and standard C control flow.\n- The metal_container_of macro shown ((void*)((uintptr_t)(ptr)-metal_offset_of(structure,member))) uses uintptr_t and pointer arithmetic. uintptr_t is a standard unsigned integer type from <stdint.h>. Casting via void* and subtracting an offset is standard C pointer/integer interplay (assuming metal_offset_of uses a standard offsetof or equivalent). Assigning the resulting void* to a struct pointer (as in dev = metal_container_of(...)) is allowed in C without an explicit cast.\n- The struct and extern declarations use only standard C syntax (aside from minor transcription omissions like a missing semicolon in the pasted snippet, which appears to be a copy error rather than a compiler extension).\n\nNotes for investigators (not flagged as suspicious here):\n- Verify the implementation of metal_offset_of (not provided). If metal_offset_of uses a compiler-specific extension (for example, a typeof-based or __builtin_offsetof implementation, or other compiler intrinsics), that would be the only place that could violate Rule 1.2. The current code as shown does not include such an extension.\n\nBecause none of the shown code employs compiler-specific keywords or constructs such as __attribute__, __extension__, typeof (GCC), statement expressions ({ ... }), inline assembler, nested functions, or other documented compiler extensions, there are no code fragments in the provided snippets that need to be reported for potential Rule 1.2 violations."
