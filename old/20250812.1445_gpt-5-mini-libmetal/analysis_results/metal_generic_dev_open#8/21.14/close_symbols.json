  "explanation": "- strcmp: The function uses strcmp to compare dev->name with dev_name. To prove this function does not violate the MISRA rule you must inspect strcmp's declaration/implementation in this codebase (or the libc wrapper used) to ensure strcmp itself is not implemented by calling memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n- implementation/alias of strcmp (macros/inlines): Some projects map string functions to faster implementations (e.g., strcmp -> memcmp). Any macro, inline, or alias that replaces strcmp must be checked because it could call memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings, which would violate the rule.\n- metal_generic_dev_sys_open: It is called by the target function. Although the MISRA rule focuses on use of memcmp to compare NUL\u2011terminated strings, the callee may perform such a forbidden comparison on the same strings; include its implementation to check for memcmp usage there as well.\n- struct metal_device (full definition): You must confirm the type and semantics of dev->name (e.g., char * vs fixed char array and whether it is guaranteed to be NUL\u2011terminated). If name is not a proper NUL\u2011terminated C string, use of strcmp (or memcmp) may be inappropriate or ambiguous for the MISRA check.\n- contract/prototype for dev_name: Verify that callers are expected to pass a NUL\u2011terminated C string for dev_name. The rule concerns comparisons of NUL\u2011terminated strings \u2014 you need the parameter contract to determine whether the comparison here is between NUL\u2011terminated strings (and thus whether use of memcmp would have been forbidden)."
