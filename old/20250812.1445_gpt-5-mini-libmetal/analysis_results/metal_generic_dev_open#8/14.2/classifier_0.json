  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_open:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_open(struct metal_bus *bus, const char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t   struct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_device *dev;\n\n\t(void)bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_device_list, node) {\n\t\tdev = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_device, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) == 0) {\n\t\t\t*device = dev;\n\t\t\treturn metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENODEV;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_device_list, node) {\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Assuming the usual definition of metal_list_for_each (for (node = (list)->next; node != (list); node = node->next)), the loop is well\u2011formed: the first clause initializes the single loop counter (node), the second clause tests the loop counter and has no persistent side effects, and the third clause updates only the loop counter. Therefore no violation. Note: compliance cannot be finally determined without the macro expansion \u2014 it would be a violation if the macro\u2019s second clause had persistent side effects, used objects that are modified in the loop body, used additional loop counters, or if the third clause modified objects other than the loop counter."
