  "explanation": "I did not include the following code fragments because they are already const-qualified, are not pointer types, or are unlikely candidates for conversion to const without additional context: the device name declaration (const char *name) is already const-qualified; the function parameter const char *dev_name is already const; the strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) use involves const-qualified strings and is appropriate; the metal_container_of macro invocation and metal_list_for_each iteration are macro usages that do not themselves declare non-const pointers to data \u2014 any pointer types they produce are included above where appropriate; the regions array and other non-pointer fields in struct metal_device are not relevant to Rule 8.13. The listed fragments are those pointer declarations that should be investigated to determine whether they could or should point to const-qualified types."
