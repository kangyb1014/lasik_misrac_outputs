  "explanation": "- struct metal_device: needed to know the exact types of its members (particularly the type of dev->name and the node member). If dev->name is declared as char * vs const char * affects whether a const qualification is required by MISRA. The node member type affects how container_of/iteration relate to constness.\n- struct metal_list: needed to know the element pointer type used by the list and whether list nodes are const-qualified; this affects whether iterated node pointers should be const.\n- metal_list_for_each (macro): the macro implementation determines the type and constness of the loop variable assignment. It may accept a const list head or produce a const pointer \u2014 its definition is required to see if the code is discarding or missing const qualifiers.\n- metal_container_of (macro): container_of can cast pointers and may remove/add const qualifiers. Its definition is required to determine whether converting from struct metal_list * to struct metal_device * is dropping const-qualification.\n- _metal (global) / type of _metal.common.generic_device_list: the declaration of the global list (and its type) is needed to see whether the list head is const-qualified (e.g. const struct metal_list) and thus whether iterating over it should yield const pointers.\n- metal_generic_dev_sys_open (prototype): to determine whether this callee requires a mutable struct metal_device * or could accept a const struct metal_device *. If the callee needs a non-const pointer then dev cannot be const; if it accepts a const pointer then dev (and possibly device) could be const-qualified according to MISRA.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyzer determine whether any pointer (dev, dev->name, node, or the output device pointer) ought to be const-qualified or whether the code is legally forced to use non-const pointers (e.g. by callee prototypes or macro behavior)."
