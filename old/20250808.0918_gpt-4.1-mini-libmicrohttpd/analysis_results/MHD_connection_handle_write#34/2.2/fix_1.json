  "explanation": "1. Removed the invalid global initializer `FILE *f = fopen(...)` which is not allowed outside functions.\n2. Replaced the macro-like `CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR` function definition with a properly named `connection_close_error` static function to prevent name collision and redefinition errors.\n3. Ensured the function `connection_close_error` matches the prior declaration (no static/non-static mismatch).\n4. Kept the existing function names `MHD_update_last_activity_`, `check_write_done`, and `try_ready_normal_body` as static with empty or default bodies, respecting original linkage and consistent with prior declarations.\n5. Used the actual function call `connection_close_error` in place of the macro `CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR` in `MHD_connection_handle_write` to avoid macro redefinition conflict.\n\nThese changes fix multiple compile errors related to invalid initializations, macro redefinitions, and linkage mismatches, while preserving the original logic and structure of the provided code."
