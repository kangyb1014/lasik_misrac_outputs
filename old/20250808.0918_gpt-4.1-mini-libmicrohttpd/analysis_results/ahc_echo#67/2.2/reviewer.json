  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The static variable 'aptr' in the provided code is used solely as a unique pointer value to distinguish request state through '*req_cls'. The code compares the address of 'aptr' to '*req_cls' and assigns '*req_cls = &aptr' to mark certain connection states. The actual value stored in 'aptr' is never read or modified; only its address is used. Importantly, the removal of 'aptr' and the pointer comparisons/assignments involving it would alter the program behavior, as it affects the state management for handling requests (e.g., triggering the BUSYPAGE response for POST requests). Hence, 'aptr' is not dead code, because it influences control flow via its address value, which impacts the timing and nature of responses. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2, dead code is code that is executed but whose removal does not affect behavior. Since removing 'aptr' would change behavior, it is not dead code. Therefore, the agent A report of a violation for Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
