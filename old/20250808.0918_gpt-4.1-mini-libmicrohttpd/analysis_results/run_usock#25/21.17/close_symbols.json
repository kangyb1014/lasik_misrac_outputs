  "explanation": "The function run_usock uses ws_receive_frame to parse the incoming buffer and ws_send_frame/send_all for sending data. These functions likely handle string or memory buffers and their internal usage of string handling functions (e.g., memcpy, strcpy) may influence if there is any out-of-bounds access. Analyzing these functions is essential to verify that they handle buffer sizes correctly and do not cause overruns. make_blocking is also called in run_usock and send_all, and while it may be less related to string handling, it is part of the call chain and may provide context about socket behavior, but its impact on string handling is likely minimal. However, it should still be included for completeness. No direct use of string.h functions is visible in run_usock, so only the callees that process buffers and strings are relevant for the MISRA C rule analysis."
