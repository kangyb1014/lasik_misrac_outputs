  "explanation": "The functions make_blocking, ws_receive_frame, ws_send_frame, send_all, and MHD_upgrade_action are needed to understand how pointers passed to or returned from these functions are used or modified, which is critical to check for const-correctness compliance with MISRA C. The MUTEX, CLIENT_SOCKS, and MHD_INVALID_SOCKET symbols are necessary to analyze pointer usage in synchronization and client socket management. The structs MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle and WsData are required to comprehend the types of pointers involved and how they might be changed or pointed to by the pointers in run_usock. Together, these provide the context to verify if pointers could or should be declared with const qualification or if their usage violates the MISRA rule about pointer constness."
