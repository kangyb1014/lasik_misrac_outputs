  "explanation": "The provided code carefully checks and adjusts the size of data copied by memcpy to prevent out-of-bounds access. In particular, when memcpy copies data from response->data[data_write_offset] to connection->write_buffer[max_chunk_hdr_len], the number of bytes copied is ret, which is derived and then truncated if it exceeds size_to_fill. Additionally, ret is constrained by response->data_size - data_write_offset and size_to_fill, ensuring that the copy does not read beyond the source buffer or write beyond the destination buffer. These bounds are enforced through explicit conditions and assertions. Therefore, the memcpy calls do not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters, and hence do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The agent A's scenario is speculative and not demonstrated by concrete evidence; the test code fails to compile, and no actual unsafe access is confirmed."
