  "explanation": "The symbol 'process_multipart_headers' is required because it is the caller of 'try_get_value', as shown in the static call graph. To determine if 'try_get_value' is dead code or not, it is essential to analyze whether 'process_multipart_headers' invokes 'try_get_value' and how often it does so; this directly impacts whether 'try_get_value' is ever executed. Examining this caller and the context of the calls made to 'try_get_value' can confirm if 'try_get_value' is reachable and functional, thus not constituting dead code under the MISRA rule. No other functions are needed because 'try_get_value' makes no further calls (no callees)."
