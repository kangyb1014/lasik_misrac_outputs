  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified try_get_value code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/459.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of try_get_value as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of try_get_value:\n```c\nstatic void\ntry_get_value (const char *buf,\n               const char *key,\n               char **destination)\n{\n  const char *spos;\n  const char *bpos;\n  const char *endv;\n  size_t klen;\n  size_t vlen;\n\n  if (NULL != *destination)\n    return;\n  bpos = buf;\n  klen = strlen (key);\n  while (NULL != (spos = strstr (bpos, key)))\n  {\n    if ( (spos[klen] != '=') ||\n         ( (spos != buf) &&\n           (spos[-1] != ' ') ) )\n    {\n      /* no match */\n      bpos = spos + 1;\n      continue;\n    }\n    if (spos[klen + 1] != '\"')\n      return;                   /* not quoted */\n    if (NULL == (endv = strchr (&spos[klen + 2],\n                                '\\\"')))\n      return;                   /* no end-quote */\n    vlen = (size_t) (endv - spos) - klen - 1;\n    *destination = malloc (vlen);\n    if (NULL == *destination)\n      return;                   /* out of memory */\n    (*destination)[vlen - 1] = '\\0';\n    memcpy (*destination,\n            &spos[klen + 2],\n            vlen - 1);\n    return;                     /* success */\n  }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above try_get_value code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer 'destination' is declared as 'char **destination', which is a pointer to a pointer to char (non-const). The function try_get_value modifies the object pointed to by '*destination' by allocating memory and copying data into it. Since the function modifies the object pointed to by '*destination', it is correct that the pointer does not point to a const-qualified type. Therefore, there is no violation of Rule 8.13 in this scenario.",
