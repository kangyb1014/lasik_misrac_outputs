The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of iterate_post as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of iterate_post:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\niterate_post (void *coninfo_cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key,\n              const char *filename, const char *content_type,\n              const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, uint64_t off,\n              size_t size)\n{\n  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls;\n  (void) kind;               /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function iterate_post contains unreachable code when the condition (0 == strcmp(key, \"name\")) is true and the inner condition (size > 0 && size <= MAXNAMESIZE) is false. In that case, the else branch sets con_info->answerstring = NULL, and then the function returns MHD_NO immediately after the if-else construct. This means that any code after the if-else construct within the if block is unreachable because the return statement prevents further execution. However, this pattern is intentional and valid within the function's logic. No code after the return statement inside this block exists, so no truly unreachable code exists. Therefore, there is no violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 as there is no unreachable code in the function.",
