  "explanation": "To analyze whether this function violates the MISRA C rule against using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, we need to check how string comparison is done. The function uses strcmp, so understanding or verifying the implementation or definition of strcmp is crucial. The function also uses malloc and snprintf for managing the dynamic string, their correct functioning affects string handling but are not related to memcmp usage. The constants MAXNAMESIZE, MAXANSWERSIZE, and GREETINGPAGE are relevant to buffer sizes and content formatting, important for the correctness of string operations. MHD_NO and MHD_YES are used as return values and must be known to interpret the function's behavior. The struct connection_info_struct contains the answerstring member; understanding this structure helps analyze side effects, but it is not related to memcmp usage. Overall, the key symbol to investigate for MISRA compliance regarding memcmp is strcmp."
