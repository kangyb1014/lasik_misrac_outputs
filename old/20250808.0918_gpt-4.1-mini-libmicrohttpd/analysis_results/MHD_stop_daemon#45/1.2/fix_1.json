  "explanation": "The original code references the type \"struct MHD_Daemon\" and uses the macro _MHD_EXTERN, but neither the struct definition nor the macro are provided, causing compilation failure. I fixed the code by explicitly defining the struct MHD_Daemon with the members used in the function (shutdown, was_quiesced, master) and removed the _MHD_EXTERN macro from the function definition. Additionally, I added necessary includes for FILE and bool types to ensure successful compilation. The original logic of MHD_stop_daemon is preserved exactly as in the original source."
