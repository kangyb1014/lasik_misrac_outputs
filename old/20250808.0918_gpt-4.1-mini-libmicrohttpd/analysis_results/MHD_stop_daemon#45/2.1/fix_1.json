  "explanation": "The errors arose because the code compared a struct instance directly to NULL, which is invalid in C. To fix this, I changed the member 'itc' of struct MHD_Daemon to be a pointer to struct MHD_itc_ (i.e., 'struct MHD_itc_ *itc') instead of an instance. This allows comparison with NULL legitimately. Also, there was a mismatched '#else' without a corresponding '#ifdef' or closing brace, so I adjusted the preprocessor directives and braces accordingly to fix the 'expected } before else' error. These changes preserve the original logic while making the code compile successfully."
