The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of compress_buf as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of compress_buf:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\ncompress_buf (z_stream *strm, const void *src, size_t src_size, size_t *offset,\n              void **dest, size_t *dest_size,\n              void *tmp)\n{\n  unsigned int have;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  int flush;\n  void *tmp_dest;\n  *dest = NULL;\n  *dest_size = 0;\n  do\n  {\n    if (src_size > CHUNK)\n    {\n      strm->avail_in = CHUNK;\n      src_size -= CHUNK;\n      flush = Z_NO_FLUSH;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      strm->avail_in = (uInt) src_size;\n      flush = Z_SYNC_FLUSH;\n    }\n    *offset += strm->avail_in;\n    strm->next_in = (const Bytef *) src;\n    do\n    {\n      strm->avail_out = CHUNK;\n      strm->next_out = tmp;\n      ret = (Z_OK == deflate (strm, flush)) ?

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "A violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 occurs if there exists unreachable code in the compress_buf function. Analysis of the provided compress_buf function shows that every part of the code is reachable through the defined control flow: the loops and conditional branches are fully exercised based on the input parameters. There is no dead code after returns or unconditional branches that make code unreachable. Therefore, the compress_buf function does not contain unreachable code and does not violate Rule 2.1.",
