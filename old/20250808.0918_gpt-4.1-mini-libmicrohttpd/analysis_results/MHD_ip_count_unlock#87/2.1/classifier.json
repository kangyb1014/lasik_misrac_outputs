The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_ip_count_unlock as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_ip_count_unlock:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_count_unlock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n#else\n  (void) daemon;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_ip_count_unlock:\n#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)\n...\n#define MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(pmutex) do{if(!MHD_mutex_unlock_(pmutex))MHD_PANIC(_(\"Failed to unlock mutex.\\n\"));\\\n}while(0)\n...\n#define MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS 1\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_ip_count_unlock code violates the rule 2.1 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The code contains conditional compilation with two branches: when MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS or MHD_USE_W32_THREADS is defined, the mutex unlock function is called; otherwise, a cast-to-void statement is executed on daemon. Since MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS is defined, only the first branch is compiled and the else branch is not reachable in this configuration. However, the else branch is part of the source code to support other configurations and its presence does not imply unreachable code in the compiled project because conditional compilation excludes it as appropriate. Therefore, no unreachable code exists in the compiled project.",
