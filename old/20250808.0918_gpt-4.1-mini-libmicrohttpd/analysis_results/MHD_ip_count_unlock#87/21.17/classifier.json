The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_ip_count_unlock as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_ip_count_unlock:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_count_unlock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n#else\n  (void) daemon;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_ip_count_unlock:\n#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)\n...\n#define MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(pmutex) do{if(!MHD_mutex_unlock_(pmutex))MHD_PANIC(_(\"Failed to unlock mutex.\\n\"));\\\n}while(0)\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_ip_count_unlock code violates the rule 21.17 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "If MHD_mutex_unlock_ internally uses string handling functions from <string.h> with pointer parameters and attempts to access beyond their bounds, this would violate Rule 21.17. However, based on the provided MHD_ip_count_unlock function and macros, there is no direct or obvious usage of string.h functions with pointer parameters that could cause out-of-bounds access. Therefore, no violation is detected in the provided code.",
