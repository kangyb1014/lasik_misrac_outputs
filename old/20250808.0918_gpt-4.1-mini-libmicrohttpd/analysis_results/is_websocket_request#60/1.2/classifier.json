  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified is_websocket_request code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/480.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of is_websocket_request as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_websocket_request:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nis_websocket_request (struct MHD_Connection *con, const char *upg_header,\n                      const char *con_header)\n{\n\n  (void) con;  /* Unused. Silent compiler warning. */\n\n  return ((upg_header != NULL) && (con_header != NULL)\n          && (0 == strcmp (upg_header, WS_UPGRADE_VALUE))\n          && (NULL != strstr (con_header, \"Upgrade\")))\n         ? MHD_YES\n         : MHD_NO;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function is_websocket_request:\nenum MHD_Result\n{\n  /**\n   * MHD result code for \"NO\".\n   */\n  MHD_NO = 0,\n\n  /**\n   * MHD result code for \"YES\".\n   */\n  MHD_YES = 1\n\n}\n...\n#define WS_UPGRADE_VALUE \"websocket\"\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above is_websocket_request code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
