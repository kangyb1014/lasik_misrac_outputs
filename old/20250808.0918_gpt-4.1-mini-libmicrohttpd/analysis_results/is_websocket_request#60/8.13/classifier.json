  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified is_websocket_request code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/483.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of is_websocket_request as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_websocket_request:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nis_websocket_request (struct MHD_Connection *con, const char *upg_header,\n                      const char *con_header)\n{\n\n  (void) con;  /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function is_websocket_request uses pointer parameters upg_header and con_header, both declared as pointing to const-qualified char types. The function does not modify the data pointed to by these pointers; it only reads and compares the strings. Therefore, the pointers correctly point to const-qualified types, adhering to Rule 8.13.",
