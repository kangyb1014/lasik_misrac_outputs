A pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "struct Request and struct Session are needed to understand the definitions and const qualifications of their members like session, sid, value_1, and value_2, and whether these are pointers and if they are const-qualified. MHD_Result and MHD_YES are required to understand the return type and values of the function, helping to confirm functional correctness but mainly for context. strcmp, fprintf, and memcpy are standard library functions used here; knowing their signatures ensures understanding of pointer constness in parameters, particularly for memcpy which modifies memory through a pointer. sizeof is a compile-time operator; its usage indicates sizes of objects, relevant for buffer boundaries and pointer targets. Overall, these symbols are essential to analyze how pointers are used and whether they modify const-qualified data, directly relating to the MISRA rule about pointer const-correctness and modification."
