  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified post_iterator code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/386.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of post_iterator as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of post_iterator:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\npost_iterator (void *cls,\n               enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n               const char *key,\n               const char *filename,\n               const char *content_type,\n               const char *transfer_encoding,\n               const char *data, uint64_t off, size_t size)\n{\n  struct Request *request = cls;\n  struct Session *session = request->session;\n  (void) kind;              /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The code contains (void) casts for 'kind', 'filename', 'content_type', and 'transfer_encoding' variables to silence compiler warnings because they are not used anywhere else in the function. These casts do not constitute dead code as they have no executable impact or side effects, merely suppress warnings. There is no code in the function that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behavior. All other code parts contribute to the intended behavior of processing form data or logging unsupported keys.",
