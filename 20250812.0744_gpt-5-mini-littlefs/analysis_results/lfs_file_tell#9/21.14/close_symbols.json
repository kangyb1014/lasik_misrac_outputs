  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_tell (or its callees) violate the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, we must inspect the code that actually could call memcmp on string data:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: This function is directly called from lfs_file_tell (via LFS_ASSERT). It is a likely place to compare names/IDs in the open-list; we must check its body for any memcmp uses comparing null-terminated fields.\n\n- lfs_file_tell_: This is the other direct callee; although it should only compute a file offset, its implementation must be inspected for any memcmp use on string data.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition): Fields of this struct (for example name or path members) determine whether comparisons inside lfs_mlist_isopen are operating on null-terminated strings. Knowing field types is necessary to decide if memcmp is being (mis)used.\n\n- struct lfs_file_t / typedef lfs_file_t (definition): The file object may be cast to struct lfs_mlist in the call; its layout and string-typed members are needed to determine whether memcmp comparisons operate on null-terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp (declaration/uses): We must find any occurrences/usages of memcmp in the target callees (or their local helpers) to evaluate whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings (the exact call sites, arguments, and length arguments are required).\n\n- strlen (declaration/uses): If code computes lengths with strlen (or similar) and then passes that length to memcmp, that is a red flag for comparing null-terminated strings with memcmp; detecting such patterns requires inspecting strlen usage alongside memcmp.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the two callee implementations, the involved structure/type definitions, and any standard string function usages) provides the necessary context to decide whether the MISRA C rule is violated."
