  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_size (or anything it directly invokes) uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings we must inspect the code (or macro expansions) of all callees and any macros invoked in the function. Explanation for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called directly from lfs_file_size. This function likely examines file metadata (e.g. names/IDs) and is a plausible place to use memcmp on string/byte buffers. Must be inspected for memcmp usage and for whether any memcmp operands are NUL\u2011terminated C strings.\n\n- lfs_file_size_: The core size computation is performed here. It may call other helpers or perform comparisons that use memcmp; its body must be checked for memcmp on strings.\n\n- lfs_max: Called by lfs_file_size_. Although it likely compares numeric values, it is a direct callee of lfs_file_size_ and should be inspected in case of unexpected use of memcmp in utility helpers.\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: Macros invoked in lfs_file_size for synchronization. These macros expand into code or calls (lock implementations, cfg accessors, or debug checks) that could contain memcmp or string comparisons in some builds; their expansions must be checked.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro used in this function. Trace/logging expansions may call formatting or helper routines that perform comparisons (or call into utility code that uses memcmp). Inspect its expansion to ensure no memcmp is used to compare NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro used here. Its expansion may perform diagnostics or equality checks that could use memcmp; inspect it to rule out memcmp on NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\nNote: The listed symbols cover all direct callees and macros expanded inside lfs_file_size plus the immediate callee chain (lfs_file_size_ -> lfs_max). Inspecting the source/expansions of these symbols is sufficient to confirm whether the target function (or code it directly invokes) violates the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
