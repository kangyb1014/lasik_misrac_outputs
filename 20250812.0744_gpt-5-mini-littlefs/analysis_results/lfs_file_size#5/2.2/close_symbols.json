  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for a dead-code (MISRA) analysis of lfs_file_size:\n\n- LFS_LOCK\n  Needed to determine whether the lock call has observable side-effects (synchronization, blocking, error returns). If LFS_LOCK performs effects that other code relies on (or affects timing), it is not removable; if it compiles to a no-op, it may be dead.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK\n  Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK: unlocking has synchronization side-effects and timing implications. Must know its semantics to decide if removal would change behaviour.\n\n- LFS_TRACE\n  Logging/tracing calls often have I/O or timing effects. Need the definition to know if LFS_TRACE produces observable behaviour (I/O, buffer flush, side-effects) or is a no-op; this determines whether the trace call in lfs_file_size is dead.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT\n  The call to lfs_mlist_isopen is wrapped in LFS_ASSERT. If LFS_ASSERT compiles to a no-op in normal builds (or to code that aborts on failure), that changes whether lfs_mlist_isopen is executed and whether it is dead. The ASSERT definition controls reachability/observability of that call.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen\n  The function is called inside the assert. To decide if that call is dead you must know whether it has side-effects (it might update internal state, perform checks with side-effects, or be purely query). Also its implementation and whether it is actually invoked depends on LFS_ASSERT expansion.\n\n- lfs_file_size_\n  Core work of lfs_file_size is delegated to lfs_file_size_. To decide whether the call is necessary (i.e., not dead) you must inspect lfs_file_size_ for side-effects, return semantics, and whether its result is used meaningfully by callers.\n\n- lfs_max\n  lfs_file_size_ (per the call graph) calls lfs_max. To fully determine whether lfs_file_size_ (and thus the call from lfs_file_size) has side-effects or is removable, you may need to inspect lfs_max to see if it alters state or only computes a value.\n\n- lfs_t (definition)\n  The structure of lfs_t (members cfg and mlist at least) is needed to understand what LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK and the assertion operate on, and whether accessing lfs->cfg or lfs->mlist has side-effects (e.g., volatile members) that would make those accesses non-dead.\n\n- lfs_file_t (definition)\n  The file object type is passed through; its definition is required to see whether passing it to lfs_file_size_ or lfs_mlist_isopen could have side-effects (e.g., if it contains volatile members or triggers special behaviour) and to determine observable effects of removing calls that use it.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (definition)\n  The asserted function takes a struct lfs_mlist pointer; its contents may affect whether the isopen check reads volatile state or interacts with other subsystems \u2014 relevant to deciding if that call is removable.\n\n- lfs_soff_t (typedef)\n  The return type: needed to check compatibility with err return path and whether returning err (an int) changes behaviour (e.g., sign/width conversions, special sentinel values) \u2014 relevant if the early return is redundant or harmful.\n\n- PRIu32 (format macro)\n  Used in the trace-format call; while formatting macros rarely affect semantics, the trace invocation could do formatting work with side-effects or cause different code paths. Knowing the macro/formatting behavior helps decide if the trace line is dead.\n\n- build/config macros that control LFS_ASSERT/LFS_TRACE/locking (e.g. NDEBUG or project-specific LFS_DEBUG/LFS_NO_TRACE)\n  Many tracing/assert/locking macros are controlled by compile-time flags. To decide whether the calls are actually emitted (and thus potentially dead), you must know the relevant build-time configuration macros and how they change the expansion of LFS_ASSERT/LFS_TRACE/LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK.\n\nIn summary: to determine whether any executed operation in lfs_file_size can be removed without changing program behaviour you must inspect the concrete definitions and build-time expansions of the lock/unlock, trace, assert, and the two callee functions (and types) they operate on; the symbols above are the minimal set required for that analysis."
