  "explanation": "To decide whether any statement in lfs_file_size is unreachable you must know the exact control-flow behavior and conditional compilation of the macros and called helper functions used in the function body:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: determine whether this macro/function can fail (causing the early return), block forever, or never return (e.g. abort/longjmp). Its return semantics decide whether the code after the if (err) is reachable.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: verify that unlocking does not alter control flow (e.g. abort/longjmp) so that the final return is reachable; if it can non-locally transfer control then code after the call could be unreachable.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: typically a macro that may be compiled out or expand to an abort/exit on failure. You must inspect its definition to know whether the expression inside it (and subsequent statements) can be executed or could be removed/turn into a non-returning call, which directly affects reachability of the lfs_mlist_isopen call and later code.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: trace/log macros sometimes expand to nothing or to functions that may alter control flow in some builds. Confirm its expansion so you can rule out trace calls as sources of unreachable code.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: this function is the expression passed to LFS_ASSERT. You need its prototype/definition to know whether it has side effects or non-local control transfers and whether that call is reachable when asserts are enabled (and irrelevant when asserts are compiled out).\n\n- lfs_file_size_: the core worker called by lfs_file_size. If lfs_file_size_ can never return normally (e.g. aborts, longjmps) or has preconditions that make its call unreachable, that affects whether the subsequent LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK and the final return in the wrapper are reachable.\n\nCollecting these symbols (and their build-time/configuration-controlled expansions) lets you determine whether any statements in lfs_file_size can never be executed and thus would violate the MISRA rule forbidding unreachable code."
