  "explanation": "- lfs_t (type/struct definition): required to see the types and const-qualification of its members (mlist, cfg, etc.) and to determine whether accessing lfs or its members here could be done through a pointer-to-const or whether the implementation requires a modifiable lfs_t.\n- lfs_file_t (type/struct definition): required to know whether the file object is mutable or contains const-qualified members and whether the function could accept a pointer-to-const lfs_file_t.\n- struct lfs_mlist (type/struct definition): the code casts file to (struct lfs_mlist*); the definition tells whether treating file as an lfs_mlist could require mutation and whether const qualification would be appropriate.\n- type of lfs->cfg (cfg field/type in lfs_t): LFS_LOCK is invoked with lfs->cfg. We need the cfg type to check whether locking expects/causes modification through that pointer (which would prevent making lfs or cfg const).\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration/definition): the target calls this with (struct lfs_mlist*)file. We must inspect its parameter types and body to determine whether it mutates the object pointed to (thus forbidding const qualification of the passed pointer) or whether it could accept a const pointer.\n- lfs_file_size_ (declaration/definition): the target returns the result of this function and forwards file and lfs to it. Its prototype and body determine whether it modifies lfs or file (so whether those pointers must be non-const) or whether it could accept const-qualified pointers.\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/inline): the macro implementation may write through the cfg pointer or otherwise require a non-const argument; we must inspect it to know if lfs->cfg (and thus lfs) must be non-const.\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro/inline): same reasoning as LFS_LOCK; it may modify underlying state through cfg and thus affect whether lfs/cfg can be const.\n\nCollectively, these symbols let us determine whether any of the pointers passed or used in lfs_file_size are (or are required to be) modified by callees or macros; that is exactly what is needed to decide whether the parameters could/should be const under the MISRA rule."
