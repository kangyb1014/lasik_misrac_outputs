  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_removeattr code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/244.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_removeattr as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_removeattr:\n```c\nint lfs_removeattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path, uint8_t type) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_removeattr(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %\"PRIu8\")\", (void*)lfs, path, type);\n\n    err = lfs_removeattr_(lfs, path, type);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_removeattr -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_removeattr:\nstatic int lfs_removeattr_(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path, uint8_t type) {\n    return lfs_commitattr(lfs, path, type, NULL, 0x3ff);\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_commitattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    lfs_mdir_t cwd;\n    lfs_stag_t tag = lfs_dir_find(lfs, &cwd, &path, NULL);\n    if (tag < 0) {\n        return tag;\n    }\n\n    uint16_t id = lfs_tag_id(tag);\n    if (id == 0x3ff) {\n        // special case for root\n        id = 0;\n        int err = lfs_dir_fetch(lfs, &cwd, lfs->root);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return lfs_dir_commit(lfs, &cwd, LFS_MKATTRS(\n            {LFS_MKTAG(LFS_TYPE_USERATTR + type, id, size), buffer}));\n}\n...\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_removeattr code violates the rule 14.2 or not.",
