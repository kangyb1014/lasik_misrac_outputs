  "explanation": "lfs_rename_: The target function immediately delegates to lfs_rename_. Although modifications made inside lfs_rename_ do not count as modifying lfs_rename's own parameters, lfs_rename_ could be implemented as an inline/function-like macro or may be exposed in a way that affects how parameters are passed/used; examine its signature/definition to be sure no rewrite/assignment of the parameter variables occurs at call site.\n\nLFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: These are used in the body and are macros or functions. If they are macros that expand into code that assigns to the local parameter variables (for example via token pasting or unusual expansion), that would violate the MISRA rule. Their definitions are required to confirm they only operate on the pointed-to objects (e.g., lfs->cfg) and do not reassign the parameter variable lfs itself.\n\nLFS_TRACE: This logging macro is passed the parameters (lfs, oldpath, newpath). A macro could conceivably modify its arguments (for example via side-effecting expressions or by taking non-const references in a function-like expansion). Inspecting LFS_TRACE's definition ensures it does not perform assignments to the parameter variables.\n\nlfs_t: The type definition for the lfs parameter is needed to understand whether any of the macro expansions (LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE) could legally perform assignments to lfs or its fields, and to confirm whether operations in macros/functions act on the object pointed to (allowed) versus reassigning the parameter variable itself (disallowed)."
