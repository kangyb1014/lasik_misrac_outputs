  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: the call to LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) controls the early return (if (err) return err;). You must inspect its definition/implementation to determine whether it can always return a non\u2011zero value, or perform non\u2011local control flow (exit/abort/longjmp) or be a no\u2011op; any of those change whether the subsequent lines are reachable.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: located after the LFS_TRACE and before the final return. If LFS_UNLOCK can perform non\u2011local control flow (or never returns), then the final return (and any following code) could be unreachable. Its definition is required to determine reachability.\n- LFS_TRACE: these macros expand into code executed in the normal path; they may be no\u2011ops in some builds or may call routines that abort/longjmp/assert. You need the macro definition to know whether the trace statements affect reachability.\n- lfs_file_rewind_: the target delegates the main work to lfs_file_rewind_. If lfs_file_rewind_ never returns (e.g. aborts or longjmps) or always triggers a particular control flow, that will make the code after its call unreachable; its body is required for analysis.\n- lfs_file_seek_: present in the static callee graph of lfs_file_rewind_. Because lfs_file_rewind_ may call lfs_file_seek_ (or other callees), you must examine lfs_file_seek_ to detect any non\u2011returning or constant\u2011return behaviour that could, transitively, make code in lfs_file_rewind unreachable.\n\nIn short, to judge MISRA's \"no unreachable code\" rule you must inspect the definitions/implementations of the macros and the called functions (including downstream callees) to detect constant return values or non\u2011local control flow (exit/abort/longjmp) that would render parts of lfs_file_rewind unreachable."
