  "explanation": "- lfs_file_rewind_: The direct implementation called by the target \u2014 must be inspected for any memcmp usage or calls that eventually call memcmp.\\n- lfs_file_seek_: Called by lfs_file_rewind_ (per the static graph) \u2014 may itself call memcmp or call other helpers that do.\\n- (all transitive callees of lfs_file_rewind_ / lfs_file_seek_): memcmp might occur deeper in the call chain; the entire transitive closure of callees is required to be sure no prohibited memcmp usage exists.\\n- memcmp: The actual standard function whose misuse is being checked \u2014 needed to find call sites and examine how its pointer/length arguments are formed.\\n- strcmp, strncmp, strlen: Common string APIs and length helpers \u2014 needed because code may use them together with memcmp (e.g. memcmp(..., strlen(...)+1)) or use safer alternatives; their presence/context helps decide if the memcmp arguments are null-terminated strings.\\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition) and lfs_file_t (type/struct definition): To determine the semantic meaning of pointers passed into memcmp (e.g. file name buffers, data buffers) you must see the struct fields to know whether those buffers are NUL-terminated strings.\\n- definitions/prototypes of any functions that produce/return buffers or lengths passed into memcmp: If memcmp is called with values computed/returned by helper functions, those helpers must be inspected to determine whether the arguments represent null-terminated strings (or lengths derived from strlen)."
