  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C const-pointer rule you must know which pointers are actually modified and the exact const-qualification in called interfaces. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_file_read_: need the prototype/definition to see the parameter types (whether it takes void * or const void *, or const qualifiers on lfs/file parameters) and to determine whether it or its implementation write through any pointer parameters (particularly buffer and file). lfs_file_read delegates the actual read, so its signature/behavior is primary for const analysis.\n\n- lfs_file_flush: lfs_file_read_ calls this; need its prototype/definition to see whether it takes/returns pointers with const qualifiers or writes through any pointer arguments that originated from lfs_file_read (affects whether buffer/file should be const).\n\n- lfs_file_flushedread: similarly called by lfs_file_read_; need its prototype/definition and body to determine whether it writes into buffer (or modifies file), and whether its parameters are const-qualified.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called by lfs_file_read via LFS_ASSERT; need its prototype to check the parameter type (const or not) because file is cast to struct lfs_mlist*. This helps determine whether file should have been const-qualified at the call site.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: the structure definition is needed to confirm how lfs_file_t relates to lfs_mlist (the code casts file to struct lfs_mlist*). This affects whether the cast hides a const-qualification mismatch.\n\n- lfs_file_t: the typedef/definition of the file handle type is required to know its actual type and any const qualifiers applied in its declaration (affects validity of passing file to functions that may modify it).\n\n- lfs_t: definition of the filesystem context type (to inspect cfg member type and whether any pointers inside lfs are const-qualified). Although lfs_file_read does not mutate lfs explicitly here, callers/macros may take pointers to cfg; need to ensure no const-qualification conflicts.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: macro/function definitions are required to see their parameter types (what they accept/modify). They receive lfs->cfg \u2014 if cfg or its pointed-to type is const-qualified, that could reveal a const-mismatch when passed to mutating lock/unlock functions.\n\nIn summary: obtain the prototypes/definitions (including parameter const qualifications and bodies where necessary) for the listed symbols so you can determine whether any pointer parameters should be const-qualified or are illegally const-qualified while being modified."
