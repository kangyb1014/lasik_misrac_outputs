  "explanation": "1) lfs_fs_size_: The target wrapper delegates the real work to lfs_fs_size_. Any use of memcmp that could violate the MISRA rule will be in lfs_fs_size_ (or in functions it calls). You must inspect the full implementation of lfs_fs_size_ to find memcmp calls and determine whether memcmp is being used to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n\n2) lfs_fs_traverse_: The static call graph shows lfs_fs_size_ calls lfs_fs_traverse_. If lfs_fs_traverse_ (or other transitive callees) contains memcmp usage, that is relevant to whether the target function (which transits into these routines) causes a MISRA violation. Include the implementation of lfs_fs_traverse_ (and any functions it calls) to locate memcmp usages and to check the nature of the compared buffers.\n\n3) memcmp: The MISRA rule is specifically about use of the standard library function memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. Include the memcmp declaration/semantic reference so the auditor can recognize call sites and determine whether arguments passed are NUL-terminated C strings (vs. binary buffers with explicit lengths)."
