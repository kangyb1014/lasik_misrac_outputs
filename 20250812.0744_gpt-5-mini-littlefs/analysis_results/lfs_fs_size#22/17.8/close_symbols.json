  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro/function is invoked with lfs->cfg. Its expansion could contain statements that assign to identifiers visible in the caller scope (macros can expand to assignments). To prove the parameter lfs is not modified inside lfs_fs_size you must inspect the exact LFS_LOCK definition.\\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK; inspect its definition to ensure it does not expand to code that assigns to the local parameter variable lfs.\\n- LFS_TRACE: This logging macro/function is passed (void*)lfs and may be a macro that expands to multiple statements. The exact definition is needed to confirm it does not perform any assignment to the parameter lfs.\\n- lfs_fs_size_: Although a callee cannot reassign the caller's local parameter variable, include the callee definition/prototype to verify it is a normal call (not a macro that could expand inline and rebind lfs) and to check whether it is implemented as a macro/inline that could modify the caller scope.\\n- typedef/struct definition of lfs_t (including cfg member type): Knowing the structure lets you confirm that uses like lfs->cfg are valid rvalue/ lvalue expressions and to check whether any macros take the cfg argument by reference in a way that could lead to modification of the lfs parameter itself.\\nThese symbols are the only additional items needed to determine whether the function parameter 'lfs' (the pointer variable itself) is ever assigned/modified by code expanded or invoked within lfs_fs_size."
