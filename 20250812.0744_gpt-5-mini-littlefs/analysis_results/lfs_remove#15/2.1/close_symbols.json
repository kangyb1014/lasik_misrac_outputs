  "explanation": "- lfs_remove_: The function called by lfs_remove. If lfs_remove_ is declared/defined with the noreturn attribute or performs non-local control flow (exit, longjmp, abort), then the statements after the call (LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_remove -> %d\", err); LFS_UNLOCK(...); return err;) would be unreachable. You must inspect its declaration/definition to decide reachability.\n- LFS_LOCK: Used in the initialization int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);. LFS_LOCK may be a macro or function that expands to/contains non-local control flow (e.g., a return, goto out, infinite loop, or a noreturn function). Its definition is required to ensure the subsequent code path (the if (err) return err; and the main body) is syntactically/semantically reachable.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Placed just before the final return. If LFS_UNLOCK is a macro that contains a return, goto, longjmp, or is noreturn, it could make the trailing return err; unreachable. Inspecting its definition is necessary to determine whether unreachable code exists.\n- LFS_TRACE: Appears twice and is commonly a macro. It could expand to code that does non-local control flow (abort/exit/longjmp/return) or to nothing. Its definition is required to determine if any following statements become unreachable.\n\n(These symbols cover the only external calls/macros in lfs_remove that can alter control flow and therefore are necessary to decide whether any statements in lfs_remove are unreachable under the MISRA rule.)"
