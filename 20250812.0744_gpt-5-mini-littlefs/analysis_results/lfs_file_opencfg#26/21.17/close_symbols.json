  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required (concise):\n- lfs_file_opencfg_: The target directly delegates to this function to open files; it will process the 'path' and cfg pointers and is the most likely place where string.h functions (strlen, memcpy, memcmp, strncpy, etc.) could be used \u2014 need its body to check for out-of-bounds uses.\n- lfs_path_namelen: Computes name length from a path; likely uses strlen/memchr or similar operations and is directly relevant to bounds checks on 'path' substrings.\n- lfs_path_islast: Tests whether a path component is the last; usually scans strings for separators \u2014 could use string functions that must not read past buffer ends.\n- lfs_path_isdir: Checks directory/terminal separator in path; similar string scanning concerns as above.\n- lfs_dir_find: Searches directory entries comparing names \u2014 likely uses memcmp/strncmp/strcmp or copies buffers; needed to verify safe length/size usage when comparing or copying names.\n- lfs_dir_get: Retrieves directory entry data into buffers \u2014 may use memcpy/memmove/memset; need to check sizes used in those calls.\n- lfs_dir_commit: Writes/updates directory entries (may copy buffers or build strings) \u2014 included to verify any memory/string ops used when committing changes.\n- lfs_tag_type3 / lfs_tag_size: Tag parsing helpers can perform byte-wise copies/compares and size calculations that may use memcpy/memcmp or compute lengths \u2014 include to ensure tag-related buffer ops are bounded.\n- lfs_cache_zero: Very likely uses memset to zero caches/buffers \u2014 need to inspect length argument to ensure it does not write beyond objects.\n- lfs_malloc: Allocation size and returned buffer size affect whether subsequent string/memory calls are bounded \u2014 include to check that allocated sizes match uses.\n- lfs_file_close_: Closing logic may move or write data (memmove/memcpy) related to file buffering; include to see if earlier open logic relies on patterns that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called by the target in an assert; while not directly string-related, it references the file/list objects and may inform lifetime/validity of pointers passed to string functions \u2014 include to ensure pointer provenance.\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro uses \"%s\" and may call functions that access the path or cfg pointers; include to verify it does not perform unsafe string ops (e.g., internal formatting that uses strlen or copies).\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro could reference lfs_mlist_isopen or other helpers; include to confirm it does not hide any string handling.\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: Lock macros may be no-ops, but could expand to functions/macros that manipulate strings or buffers for diagnostics \u2014 include to be certain they do not use string.h ops on the function arguments.\n- struct lfs_file_config: Definition is required to know the types and sizes of cfg->buffer, cfg->attrs and cfg->attr_count so any use of string/memory functions on those fields can be checked for bounds.\n- lfs_t / lfs_file_t: Type definitions are needed to inspect fields (e.g., lfs->cfg, mlist, file internals) to determine pointer provenance and buffer sizes used by callees.\n\nNotes: The above set is focused on symbols that either are directly called by lfs_file_opencfg or are likely to perform string/memory operations on 'path', cfg->buffer/attrs, or directory/name buffers. Inspecting these implementations and the struct/type definitions will allow a precise check for any use of functions from <string.h> that might access beyond referenced object bounds."
