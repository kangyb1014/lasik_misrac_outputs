  "explanation": "To decide whether lfs_file_opencfg violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings, the analyzer must inspect not only the target function but any callees that could perform string/name comparisons or manipulate path/name buffers. The listed symbols are required for that inspection for these reasons:\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: directly called by lfs_file_opencfg; may compare file/list entry names or identifiers \u2014 must check for memcmp use and whether those operands are C strings.\n- lfs_file_opencfg_: primary worker called by lfs_file_opencfg; its implementation can contain memcmp usage or string comparisons and is central to the rule check.\n- lfs_dir_find: likely locates directory entries by name; common place to compare names \u2014 must inspect how comparisons are done (memcmp vs string functions) and whether names are null\u2011terminated.\n- lfs_path_islast: operates on path components; may perform comparisons on path segments or tests that could use memcmp/strcmp.\n- lfs_mlist_append: manipulates metadata/list entries; may compare or copy name buffers \u2014 inspect for memcmp use on strings.\n- lfs_path_isdir: tests whether a path component is a directory name \u2014 could contain comparisons of names or terminators.\n- lfs_path_namelen: returns lengths of path/name elements; critical to determine whether names are handled as length\u2011prefixed buffers (memcmp may be appropriate) or as null\u2011terminated strings (memcmp would violate the rule).\n- lfs_dir_commit: directory write/commit code could compare or copy entry names during updates \u2014 inspect for memcmp usage.\n- lfs_tag_type3 / lfs_tag_size: directory/tag parsing helpers referenced from file_opencfg_; while not string helpers, they appear in the call chain and should be checked for any memcmp usage in name/tag handling.\n- lfs_dir_get: reads directory entries (including names); must check how it returns/compares names (null\u2011terminated vs length) and whether memcmp is used.\n- lfs_ctz_fromle32: low\u2011level data decoding called in the chain; included to ensure no hidden memcmp usage in data parsing routines reachable from file open.\n- lfs_malloc / lfs_cache_zero: memory helpers used by the call chain; included to see how buffers are allocated/initialized (e.g., whether strings are nul\u2011terminated after allocation), which affects whether subsequent memcmp calls are comparing C strings.\n- lfs_tag_size / lfs_min: helpers that appear in the call graph; included to ensure no accidental memcmp usage in utility code reachable from file opening.\n- lfs_file_close_: called by file_opencfg_ on error paths; include to check for memcmp usage in cleanup/close code reachable from the open path.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency: filesystem consistency routine called by file_opencfg_; included because it is in the call chain and could conceivably do string comparisons during recovery.\n- memcmp: the library function the MISRA rule targets \u2014 search for uses and analyze operand types to determine if any call compares null\u2011terminated strings.\n- strcmp / strncmp / strlen: include these standard string functions to detect correct/alternative string comparison usage and to understand whether code uses proper string functions instead of memcmp; also useful to determine whether operands are used as C strings (null\u2011terminated).\n\nIn short: inspect these symbols (the direct callees and all reachable helpers in the provided static call graph, plus memcmp and related string APIs) to determine whether any reachable code uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings or whether comparisons are length\u2011based buffer comparisons (which would not violate the MISRA rule)."
