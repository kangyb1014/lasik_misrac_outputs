  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: the direct callee of the target; must be inspected for any use of memcmp or for passing string/buffer arguments into deeper calls.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit: all functions called (directly or indirectly) by lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ per the static call graph. Any of these may contain memcmp calls or pass buffers/strings to memcmp; they must be examined to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- memcmp: the Standard Library function whose usage is restricted by the MISRA rule. You must locate all memcmp call sites (and their argument types/values) to decide if the compared objects are null-terminated strings.\n- lfs_t: the filesystem context type passed through these calls. Its definition (and the definitions of any sub-structures it references in the above functions, e.g. directory/state structures) is required to determine the types of buffers/fields that may be compared with memcmp and whether they are null-terminated strings.\n\nNote: after retrieving the source for the listed functions and the lfs_t/related struct/type definitions, also inspect any additional types or helper functions referenced therein (e.g., dir entry or gstate structures) because they may define the buffers involved in memcmp calls."
