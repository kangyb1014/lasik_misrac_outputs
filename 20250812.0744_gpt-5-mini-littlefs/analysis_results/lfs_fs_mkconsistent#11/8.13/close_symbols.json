  "explanation": "To determine whether the pointer parameter lfs should be const (or must be non-const) under the MISRA rule, the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (prototype/definition): The target function immediately forwards lfs to this function. If this function (by its signature or implementation) modifies the object pointed to by lfs, then lfs cannot be const. Conversely, if it does not modify lfs and accepts a const pointer, lfs could be const.\n\n- lfs_t (typedef/struct definition): The concrete type of the pointer is required to know which members are accessed/modified (for example cfg) and whether any member access in this function would violate const qualification.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (e.g. struct lfs_config) / its definition: The code calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). You must know the type and whether locking operates on mutable state of the config or its fields to decide if lfs (or its cfg member) must be non-const.\n\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definitions/prototypes): These are invoked with lfs->cfg. If the lock/unlock operations modify the pointed object or require a non-const pointer, lfs cannot be const. Their signatures also show whether they accept const-qualified pointers.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/function): The function performs LFS_TRACE(\"...\", (void*)lfs) \u2014 note the explicit cast to (void*) which discards const. To judge MISRA compliance you need the trace macro/func definition and whether the cast or trace call discards const or otherwise violates const-correctness.\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit (prototypes/definitions): These are direct callees of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (the function called by the target). To decide whether lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (and therefore the original lfs pointer) must be non-const you need to know whether these functions (by signature or body) modify lfs or objects reachable from lfs (e.g. update metadata, write to state fields). Their signatures may also indicate const-correctness expectations for the pointers they receive.\n\nIn short: to determine whether the pointer parameter to lfs_fs_mkconsistent should be const-qualified or must remain non-const, you must inspect the type of lfs and cfg, the lock/trace macros (because of possible const discarding), the signature/implementation of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_, and the implementations/signatures of its downstream callees that may mutate lfs-related state."
