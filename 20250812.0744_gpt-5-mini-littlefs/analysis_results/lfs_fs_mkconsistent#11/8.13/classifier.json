  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_fs_mkconsistent code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/91.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_fs_mkconsistent as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_fs_mkconsistent:\n```c\nint lfs_fs_mkconsistent(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_mkconsistent(%p)\", (void*)lfs);\n\n    err = lfs_fs_mkconsistent_(lfs);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_mkconsistent -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_fs_mkconsistent code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The lfs parameter is used to perform state changes: LFS_LOCK(LFS_CFG) uses lfs->cfg to take a lock and LFS_UNLOCK releases it, and the function calls lfs_fs_mkconsistent_(lfs) which (by name and intended behavior) will modify the filesystem state via the lfs object. Because the pointed-to object is modified through this pointer, it must not be const-qualified. Making the parameter 'const lfs_t *lfs' would prevent those modifications, so Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
