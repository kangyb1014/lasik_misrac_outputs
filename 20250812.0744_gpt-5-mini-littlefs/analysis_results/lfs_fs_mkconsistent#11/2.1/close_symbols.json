  "explanation": "To determine whether any code in lfs_fs_mkconsistent is unreachable you must know whether the calls or macros used there can change control flow (returning vs never returning, longjmp/exit, or contain early returns). Explaination for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The call LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) is used to set err and to decide an early return. You must inspect the LFS_LOCK macro/function/definition to know whether it can itself be non\u2011returning (calls exit/longjmp) or has side effects that make the subsequent code unreachable, and to confirm its return semantics.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: The function/macro used to unlock may be implemented in a way that does not return or alters control flow (rare but possible). Its definition is needed to verify the unlock call in the normal path does not make following code unreachable.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macros sometimes expand to complex code (including conditionally compiled return/abort in error builds). You must inspect its definition/expansion to ensure it does not contain statements that would prevent later statements from being reached.\n\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_: The callee invoked (err = lfs_fs_mkconsistent_(lfs)) could itself be annotated as non\u2011returning or implemented to loop/abort. You need its prototype/definition (including attributes such as noreturn) to know whether code after that call (the second TRACE, the UNLOCK and the final return) is reachable.\n\n- lfs_t (definition, including type of member 'cfg'): To correctly interpret LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) you need the type of lfs->cfg (and the lfs_t definition) because LFS_LOCK may be a macro whose behavior depends on the cfg type (e.g., selecting different implementations or expanding differently), which can affect control flow.\n\n- Any function/attribute macros that annotate functions as non\u2011returning: Some projects use project macros (e.g. LFS_NORETURN) or compiler attributes that mark functions as noreturn. Knowing these definitions is necessary to detect that calls (LFS_LOCK, lfs_fs_mkconsistent_, etc.) are guaranteed not to return, which directly creates unreachable code after them.\n\nCollecting these symbols (their prototypes/definitions/macros) lets the analyzer decide deterministically whether any statements in lfs_fs_mkconsistent are impossible to reach, which is required to check the MISRA rule against unreachable code."
