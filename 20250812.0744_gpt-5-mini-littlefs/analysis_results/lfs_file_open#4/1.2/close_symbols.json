  "explanation": "For checking use of compiler language extensions you must inspect any macros, types or called functions whose definitions could hide extensions. Explainations:\n- LFS_LOCK: Could be a macro or inline function that uses compiler extensions (GCC attributes, asm, typeof, statement expressions, inline assembly, or non\u2011standard calling conventions). Need its definition to determine if it uses extensions.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its implementation may use compiler-specific constructs.\n- LFS_TRACE: Likely a logging macro; may use variadic macros, __VA_ARGS__, GNU statement expressions, or compiler builtins (e.g. __builtin_printf) \u2014 inspect its definition for extensions.\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macro may expand to compiler-specific intrinsics or statement expressions; check definition for extensions.\n- lfs_t (type/struct definition): The type of lfs is needed to see the cfg member type and any attributes on the struct or members (packed, aligned, or compiler-specific annotations).\n- lfs_file_t (type/struct definition): Needed to ensure the cast to (struct lfs_mlist*) and any non\u2011standard type usages are not using extensions.\n- struct lfs_mlist (type/struct definition): Required to validate the cast used in the assert and to inspect any annotations or extension usage inside the struct definition.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration/definition): Although called only, its declaration could be a macro or use non\u2011standard function attributes (format, alias, noreturn, etc.). Inspect to rule out extensions.\n- lfs_file_open_ (declaration/definition): Its prototype/definition may use inline, nested functions, attributes, or other extensions \u2014 needed to determine presence of extensions.\n- headers/config where LFS_* macros are defined: The header(s) that define the LFS_* macros and related configuration may contain conditional macros that use compiler extensions or rely on compiler\u2011specific features; include them for complete analysis.\n\nProvide these definitions to the next analyzer so it can detect any use of compiler-specific language extensions (variadic macro usage beyond standard, GCC attributes, statement expressions, typeof, inline asm, nested functions, nonstandard pragmas/annotations, etc.)."
