  "explanation": "Purpose of each symbol for the MISRA memcmp check:\n\n- lfs_fs_traverse_: This is the direct callee from the target. Any use of memcmp on NUL-terminated strings reachable from the target will appear here, so its body must be inspected first.\n\n- lfs_pair_isnull: A callee of lfs_fs_traverse_. It may compare pair fields or byte buffers; its implementation must be inspected for memcmp calls that operate on strings.\n\n- lfs_tortoise_detectcycles: A callee that may perform comparisons while detecting cycles; could use memcmp on buffers or names\u2014needs checking.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Directory fetch routines commonly compare directory-entry names; this is a likely place where memcmp could be used to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- lfs_dir_get: Directory lookup/reading code that may compare entry names or keys; must be examined for memcmp usage on strings.\n\n- lfs_ctz_fromle32: Low-level parsing routine; although less likely, it may call comparison helpers \u2014 include to be certain no memcmp-on-string usage is hidden there.\n\n- lfs_tag_type3: Tag/field parsing helper called by the traverse path; include to ensure no memcmp is used on NUL-terminated strings inside parsing logic.\n\n- lfs_ctz_traverse: Traversal of compact tree/CTZ structures may compare keys or names; inspect for memcmp usage.\n\n- memcmp: The standard library function itself must be examined (or its uses located) to determine whether any calls found in the above symbols are comparing NUL-terminated strings (the MISRA concern).\n\nNote: The above list follows the static callees reported for lfs_fs_traverse_. Any additional callees discovered while inspecting these functions should also be included to fully determine compliance."
