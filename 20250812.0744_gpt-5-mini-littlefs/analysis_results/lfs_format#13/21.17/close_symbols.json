  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking MISRA <string.h> bound-safety\n\n- lfs_format_: The target directly calls lfs_format_. Any uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/strcmp/strlen/etc. that could cause OOB accesses may be inside this implementation; you must inspect it.\n- lfs_init, lfs_min, lfs_alloc_ckpoint, lfs_dir_alloc, lfs_fs_disk_version, lfs_superblock_tole32, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_deinit: These are the callees of lfs_format_ (from the static call graph). They may contain string.h calls (memcpy, memcmp, memset, etc.) or manipulate buffers passed from the config/lfs state. To determine whether any string function could access beyond object bounds you must inspect each of these implementations.\n- struct lfs_config: lfs_format logs and passes fields from this structure (context, read/prog/erase/sync callbacks, read_size, prog_size, block_size, block_count, cache_size, lookahead_size, read_buffer, prog_buffer, lookahead_buffer, name_max, file_max, attr_max). Correct analysis of any string function that operates on these buffers/sizes requires the exact field types, sizes and semantics from this struct definition.\n- lfs_t: The filesystem state object passed into lfs_format and on into lfs_format_ and its callees. Many buffer accesses and in-memory layouts that string functions might operate on depend on lfs_t internals.\n- callback types (cfg->read, cfg->prog, cfg->erase, cfg->sync) and their prototypes: Callees may invoke these callbacks to read/write blocks or to copy data; their prototypes (signatures and expected buffer sizes) are necessary to judge whether buffers passed to string.h functions are appropriately sized and used.\n- cfg buffers: read_buffer, prog_buffer, lookahead_buffer: These are buffer pointers provided by the caller. Any memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp usage in lfs_format_ or deeper must be checked against these buffers' declared sizes and intended use; therefore the exact buffer types and how their sizes relate to read_size/prog_size/lookahead_size are needed.\n- LFS_TRACE: The tracing macro/function may format data into internal buffers or call snprintf/etc. To be thorough, inspect its implementation to see if it uses any string.h functions unsafely or copies into fixed-size buffers without bounds checks.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: Although these are synchronization macros, their implementations (especially if they wrap logging or checks) should be checked to ensure they do not hide any string.h usage that could be OOB.\n\nIn short: include the implementation of lfs_format_ and all its direct callees plus the definitions of lfs_t and struct lfs_config (including callback prototypes and buffer fields) and the macros LFS_TRACE/LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK. These symbols collectively let the next analyst trace any use of string.h functions to confirm whether buffer lengths and pointer parameters are used without risking out-of-bounds accesses."
