  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_dir_read code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/259.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_dir_read as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_read:\n```c\nint lfs_dir_read(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir, struct lfs_info *info) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_read(%p, %p, %p)\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)dir, (void*)info);\n\n    err = lfs_dir_read_(lfs, dir, info);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_read -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_dir_read code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The parameters lfs_dir_read(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir, struct lfs_info *info) are not const-qualified because the function (and the internal helper lfs_dir_read_) uses them to modify state: 'dir' is an iterator that is advanced/modified, 'info' is an output structure filled by the call, and the lfs object is subject to locking and internal state changes. Therefore none of these pointers should be const-qualified and Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
