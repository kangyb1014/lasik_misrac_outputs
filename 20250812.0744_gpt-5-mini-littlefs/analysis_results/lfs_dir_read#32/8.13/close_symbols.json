  "explanation": "For determining whether any pointer parameter in lfs_dir_read should be const-qualified (or must remain non-const because it is modified), the analyzer needs the following symbols:\n\n- lfs_dir_read_ (prototype/definition): lfs_dir_read simply forwards to lfs_dir_read_. You must inspect lfs_dir_read_ to see whether it modifies the objects pointed to by its pointer parameters (lfs, dir, info) or accepts them as const. This is the primary callee that determines mutability.\n\n- lfs_dir_fetch (prototype/definition): lfs_dir_read_ calls lfs_dir_fetch. If lfs_dir_fetch writes through any pointer passed from lfs_dir_read, that prevents making those pointers const. You need its signature and behavior.\n\n- lfs_dir_getinfo (prototype/definition): similarly, lfs_dir_getinfo is called by lfs_dir_read_. If it writes into the struct lfs_info *info or other pointers, info cannot be const.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition): to know whether lfs_dir_read or its callees modify the object pointed to by lfs (fields that are written), you need the structure definition (fields, mutability). Also to see the type of the cfg field.\n\n- lfs_dir_t (type definition): to determine whether dir should be const, you must know the contents and whether callees modify dir's fields.\n\n- struct lfs_info (type definition): to decide if info could be const, you must know whether its members are written by lfs_dir_read_ / lfs_dir_getinfo.\n\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/function and its prototype): lfs_dir_read calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). The lock operation may mutate state reachable from lfs (or cfg). You need the lock API signature and whether it requires a non-const cfg pointer to conclude whether lfs must be non-const.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro/function and its prototype): same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 unlocking may modify the cfg or other lfs state.\n\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/function and its prototype): although typically non-mutating, the trace macro's prototype influences whether arguments must be const or non-const (e.g., if it takes non-const pointers or casts them). It can force removal of const if its API requires non-const parameters.\n\n- lfs->cfg (type of the cfg field / its API): the concrete cfg type and its API (what LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK expect) are needed to determine if passing lfs as non-const is necessary because cfg operations mutate the configuration or require non-const pointers.\n\nCollecting these symbols (signatures/definitions and any information about whether functions write through their pointer parameters) is sufficient to determine whether any of the pointer parameters of lfs_dir_read should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
