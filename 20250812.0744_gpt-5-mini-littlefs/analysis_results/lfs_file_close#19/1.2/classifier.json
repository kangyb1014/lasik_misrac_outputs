  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_close code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/152.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_close as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_close:\n```c\nint lfs_file_close(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_close(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)file);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    err = lfs_file_close_(lfs, file);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_close -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_close code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
