  "explanation": "You must inspect the definitions/prototypes listed above because the target function itself only invokes macros and calls into other symbols. Any compiler language extension usage that should be reported (GCC/Clang statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, nested functions, asm(), __attribute__ annotations, __builtin_*, nonstandard variadic constructs, or other documented vendor extensions) will normally appear in those definitions rather than in the small wrapper shown. Concretely:\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: these are macros (or inline helpers) invoked by the function; they may be implemented with statement-expressions, typeof, inline asm, or attributes. Check their definitions.\n- LFS_TRACE: usually a macro/wrapper for logging; its definition may use variadic macro extensions, __attribute__((format)), or other compiler-specific features.\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro may use extensions (statement-expr, __FILE__/__LINE__ are standard but some implementations use extensions).\n- lfs_file_close_: the called function\u2019s prototype or inline definition may contain compiler attributes or use nonstandard function declarations; inspect both prototype and implementation.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called in an assertion; it may be defined as an inline/static function or macro that uses extensions (e.g., inline with GCC-specific keywords, statement-expr, typeof).\n- lfs_t, lfs_file_t, struct lfs_mlist: type definitions can hide extensions (compiler-specific attributes on types, bit-field widths using implementation-defined extensions, anonymous structs/unions that may be extension in some compilers).\n- type of lfs->cfg (the configuration object passed into LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK): the cfg type or its members might be declared with attributes or use compiler extensions that affect how the macros operate.\n\nProvide these symbol definitions to the next analyzer so it can detect any use of language compiler extensions in the things the target function depends on."
