  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol:\n\n- lfs_setattr_ (declaration + definition): lfs_setattr simply forwards the same pointer arguments to lfs_setattr_. To determine whether the const-qualified pointers in lfs_setattr are appropriate (or are cast away/modified), you must inspect lfs_setattr_ signature and body to see if it accepts const pointers or modifies the objects pointed-to.\n\n- lfs_commitattr (declaration + definition): the static call graph shows lfs_setattr_ calls lfs_commitattr. If lfs_commitattr (or parameters it receives) writes to the buffer, path, or modifies lfs, that affects whether the pointers should be const-qualified. You need its signature and body.\n\n- struct lfs_t (type definition): the first parameter is lfs_t *lfs. To check whether lfs should be a pointer-to-const (i.e., lfs_t const *), you need the structure definition and to know which members are modified by this call or its callees.\n\n- type of lfs->cfg (e.g., struct lfs_config): LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK are invoked on lfs->cfg. If those macros require a non-const pointer to cfg (they likely mutate lock state), lfs cannot be const. You must know the cfg type to judge const-correctness requirement.\n\n- LFS_LOCK macro (definition) and LFS_UNLOCK macro (definition): these macros may mutate the cfg object (or call functions that do). If they modify cfg, that forces non-const on lfs (or at least on cfg). Inspecting their definitions shows whether they take/require non-const pointers or produce side-effects on pointed objects.\n\n- LFS_TRACE macro (definition): although usually a logging macro, it receives path and buffer pointers. Confirming that LFS_TRACE does not modify the pointed-to data is necessary to ensure const qualifiers are not violated by logging usage.\n\n- Transitive callees of lfs_setattr_ / lfs_commitattr that accept or modify the same pointers (e.g., low-level block read/write APIs): lfs_setattr_ and lfs_commitattr may forward the pointers to lower-level routines that actually modify the data (or accept non-const pointers). To conclude const-correctness you must inspect any transitive callees that operate on the same pointer arguments.\n\nProvide these symbol definitions/signatures to the next analyzer so it can determine whether any pointer parameter is passed to a function that modifies the pointed object or whether any non-const pointer could safely be made const under MISRA guidance."
