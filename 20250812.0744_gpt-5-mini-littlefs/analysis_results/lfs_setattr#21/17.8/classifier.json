  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_setattr code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/173.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_setattr as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_setattr:\n```c\nint lfs_setattr(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_setattr(%p, \\\"%s\\\", %\"PRIu8\", %p, %\"PRIu32\")\",\n            (void*)lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    err = lfs_setattr_(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_setattr -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_setattr:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic int lfs_setattr_(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path,\n        uint8_t type, const void *buffer, lfs_size_t size) {\n    if (size > lfs->attr_max) {\n        return LFS_ERR_NOSPC;\n    }\n\n    return lfs_commitattr(lfs, path, type, buffer, size);\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_setattr code violates the rule 17.8 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The function does not assign to any of its parameters. The pointer parameter 'lfs' is dereferenced (lfs->cfg) and passed to macros, but the pointer itself is not modified or reassigned. The other parameters (path, type, buffer, size) are only read and forwarded to lfs_setattr_ and lfs_commitattr; any modification of the objects they point to would occur via the pointed-to objects (allowed).",
