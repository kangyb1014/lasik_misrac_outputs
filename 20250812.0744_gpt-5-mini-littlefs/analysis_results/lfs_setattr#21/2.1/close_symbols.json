  "explanation": "- lfs_setattr_: The direct callee. You must inspect its body to determine whether it always returns normally, or whether it can diverge (infinite loop), longjmp/exit/abort, or otherwise prevent execution of subsequent statements (which would make code after the call unreachable).\n- lfs_commitattr: Appears in the static call graph as a callee of lfs_setattr_. If lfs_setattr_ delegates control to lfs_commitattr (which might not return or might transfer control), that can affect reachability of code after the lfs_setattr_ call; include it to determine reachability transitively.\n- LFS_LOCK: Macro or function invoked at the top of lfs_setattr. You must inspect its implementation/signature to see whether it can fail (non-zero) and return (which enables the early return in lfs_setattr), or whether it can never return / longjmp / abort or otherwise alter control flow (which could make later code unreachable).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Macro or function called before returning. Its behavior matters for reachability analysis (for example, if LFS_UNLOCK contains a non-returning call or conditional infinite loop), and to ensure there is no unreachable cleanup.\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macro/function used in the function. Macros can expand to control-flow constructs (e.g., do/while, goto, return) or to nothing; its expansion must be checked to confirm it does not affect reachability of surrounding statements.\n- lfs_t: Definition of the filesystem context type (structure) is required to know the type and semantics of the cfg field and to understand any inline behaviours or members that macros/functions (LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK) depend on.\n- (type of) lfs->cfg: The concrete cfg type (the member stored in lfs_t->cfg). LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK take this object; you need its definition to inspect how the lock/unlock implementations use it and whether they can alter control flow (e.g., by calling non-returning functions).\n\nIncluding these symbols (and their implementations/definitions) lets the next analyst determine whether any statements in lfs_setattr are provably unreachable (per MISRA) because of non-returning calls, infinite loops, longjmps, macros that expand to control-flow-altering code, or other constructs that affect reachability."
