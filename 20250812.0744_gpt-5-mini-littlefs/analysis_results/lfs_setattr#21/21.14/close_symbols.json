  "explanation": "lfs_setattr_: direct callee of the target function \u2014 its body must be inspected for any use of memcmp (or wrapper helpers) comparing strings.\n\nlfs_commitattr: indirect callee (called by lfs_setattr_) \u2014 must be inspected because it may perform attribute/name comparisons and could call memcmp on NUL-terminated strings.\n\nmemcmp: the Standard Library function named in the MISRA rule \u2014 include its usage sites to determine whether it is being used to compare NUL-terminated strings.\n\nstrcmp, strncmp: common string comparison functions; include them because the callees may use these instead of memcmp, or may wrap/forward string comparisons that could be relevant to the rule.\n\nLFS_TRACE: tracing macro used in the target \u2014 its expansion could contain string handling or calls that use memcmp/strcmp; include to be sure no prohibited comparisons occur in logging.\n\nLFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: locking macros used in the target \u2014 include their definitions to ensure no hidden comparisons (unlikely but necessary for a complete analysis) and to understand control flow that might affect which code paths are taken.\n\nlfs_t: the filesystem context type \u2014 include its definition to follow any inline helpers or macro expansions that reference members (e.g., cfg) which could lead to comparison code.\n\nNote: to fully determine compliance, the next agent should obtain the full implementations of lfs_setattr_, lfs_commitattr and any other functions they call (and macro expansions) so all uses of memcmp/strcmp/strncmp on potentially NUL-terminated strings can be examined."
