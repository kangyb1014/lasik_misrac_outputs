  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: Could be a macro or function. Need its definition/expansion to ensure it does not perform assignments to the parameter variable `lfs` (e.g. via macro side-effects) \u2014 MISRA forbids modifying the pointer parameter itself.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reason as LFS_LOCK; its expansion could contain side-effects that assign to `lfs` or its members and must be checked.\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro/function is invoked with (void*)lfs and (void*)dir. Although tracing normally reads values, a macro expansion could mistakenly assign or rebind parameters; inspect its definition to ensure it does not modify the pointer parameters.\n- lfs_dir_close_: The callee must be inspected to confirm it is a normal function (no macro trickery or inlined macro that could reassign `lfs` or `dir` in the caller). If lfs_dir_close_ is a macro or inlineable construct, it might contain code that modifies the caller\u2019s parameter variables.\n- struct lfs_t (definition): Required to see the layout and type of the member accessed (lfs->cfg). Also to confirm whether `lfs` is a pointer to a non-standard typedef that could interact with macros in an unexpected way.\n- struct lfs_dir_t (definition): To confirm whether any use of `dir` (or casts to void*) could trigger macros/operations that rebind or assign the `dir` parameter variable.\n- type/definition of lfs->cfg: LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are called with lfs->cfg; need the cfg type and its related macros/functions to confirm those calls do not expand to code that assigns to `lfs` (the pointer parameter) or otherwise modify the parameter variable itself.\n\n(Only these symbols are needed to determine whether the target function itself modifies its parameter variables via direct code or macro expansions. Callee-side modification of the objects pointed-to is allowed by the MISRA rule and is not a violation; we still request lfs_dir_close_ to rule out macro/expansion cases.)"
