  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_stat_: The target delegates the work to this function; any use of memcmp on null\u2011terminated strings inside the implementation would make the target violate the rule.\\n- lfs_gstate_needssuperblock: Listed as a callee of lfs_fs_stat_; its implementation may call memcmp on string data (e.g. labels/IDs).\\n- lfs_fs_disk_version: Callee of lfs_fs_stat_; may perform comparisons of version/identifier buffers using memcmp.\\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Callee of lfs_fs_stat_; directory handling code often compares names/strings and could misuse memcmp.\\n- lfs_dir_get: Callee of lfs_fs_stat_; likewise may compare directory entry names or string-like fields.\\n- lfs_superblock_fromle32: Callee of lfs_fs_stat_; converts/reads superblock fields \u2014 could compare textual identifiers with memcmp.\\n- memcmp: The standard function itself \u2014 the analyzer needs to identify calls to memcmp and inspect their arguments to determine whether they are used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\\n- lfs_t: Type of the first argument to lfs_fs_stat; its fields may be passed down to callees and could be pointers to null\u2011terminated strings compared via memcmp.\\n- struct lfs_fsinfo: Type of the second argument; its contents may be compared using memcmp in callees.\\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: Macros used by the target \u2014 include definitions to ensure they do not wrap or call any string comparisons (they usually handle locking).\\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macro/function used in the target \u2014 include its definition to ensure tracing does not call memcmp or perform string comparisons.\\n\\nInclude the full source/definitions for each listed symbol (function bodies, macros, and relevant type/struct definitions). The key goal is to locate all memcmp call sites reachable from lfs_fs_stat and inspect the arguments to determine whether any memcmp is comparing null\u2011terminated C strings (which would violate the MISRA rule)."
