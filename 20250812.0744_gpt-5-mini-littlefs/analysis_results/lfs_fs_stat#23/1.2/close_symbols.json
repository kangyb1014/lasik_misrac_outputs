  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This macro is invoked directly in the target function. Compiler-specific language extensions (e.g. statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __attribute__, __builtin_* or inline asm) are commonly hidden inside lock macros; you must inspect its definition to see if any extension tokens are used.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock macro may expand to compiler-specific constructs, so its definition must be checked.\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing is typically implemented as a macro that may use variadic macros, __attribute__, __builtin_expect, or other compiler extensions. Inspect its definition to detect any non\u2011standard language features.\n- lfs_fs_stat_: Although called rather than expanded here, knowing its declaration/definition is necessary because the target function simply forwards to it; the called function\u2019s prototype/definition may introduce extension usage that affects the target (e.g. parameter attributes, inline asm, or non\u2011standard linkage specifications).\n- lfs_t: The target dereferences lfs and accesses lfs->cfg. The type definition may contain non\u2011standard keywords, attributes, bit\u2011fields with implementation specifics, or compiler extensions on members; inspect lfs_t to locate such uses.\n- struct lfs_fsinfo: The second parameter\u2019s type must be examined for any non\u2011standard constructs (attributes, anonymous structures/unions if considered extensions by the compiler, flexible-array/extension usage) that would cause the target function to rely on language extensions."
