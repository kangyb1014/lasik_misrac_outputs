  "explanation": "lfs_file_truncate_: direct callee of the target \u2014 its body must be inspected for any use of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings.\nlfs_mlist_isopen: direct callee (asserted in the target) \u2014 inspect for memcmp usage (could compare names/strings).\nlfs_file_size_, lfs_file_seek_, lfs_cache_drop, lfs_file_flushedread, lfs_file_flush, lfs_ctz_find, lfs_file_write_: transitive callees of lfs_file_truncate_ (given in the call graph). Any of these may call memcmp or call other helpers that do; their implementations must be checked for memcmp misuse on NUL-terminated strings.\nmemcmp: the Standard Library symbol that the MISRA rule forbids for comparing null-terminated strings \u2014 needed to identify direct calls and review call-sites/parameters to determine whether the compared buffers are NUL-terminated strings.\nLFS_ASSERT, LFS_TRACE, LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: macros used in the target which may expand to code (or call helpers) that could use memcmp or string comparisons; their expansions should be checked to rule out indirect memcmp use.\n\nReasoning: to determine whether the target (or anything it invokes) violates the MISRA rule, the next agent must examine the implementations of all direct and transitive callees and any macro expansions referenced by the target to find uses of memcmp and verify whether those uses compare NUL-terminated strings rather than raw byte buffers."
