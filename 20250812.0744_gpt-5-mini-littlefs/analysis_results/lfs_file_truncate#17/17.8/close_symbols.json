  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: macro/function called with lfs->cfg. Must inspect its expansion/definition to ensure it does not assign to the parameter variable `lfs` (e.g. via macro side-effects or evaluating and reassigning an identifier).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK for the unlock macro/function \u2014 its expansion must not modify the parameter variables of the enclosing function.\n- LFS_TRACE: tracing macro is used with the parameters; macros can expand to code that assigns to their arguments or introduce temporary names that shadow/modify parameters. Verify its expansion does not perform any assignment to `lfs`, `file`, or `size`.\n- LFS_ASSERT: assertion macro is passed an expression involving `file`; its expansion could contain code that modifies parameters (or uses them in assignments). Inspect to ensure it does not modify the function parameters.\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: called with lfs->mlist and a cast of `file`. Although a normal function cannot rebind caller parameters, this symbol must be checked to ensure it is not a macro or inline expansion that could assign to `file` or `lfs` (or to verify there are no unexpected side-effects from a macro). Also check the prototype for any macros used.\n- lfs_file_truncate_: this is the primary callee. Confirm it is an actual function (not a macro) and that its definition does not expand in-place in this translation unit in a way that could reassign `lfs`, `file`, or `size` in the caller. (Modifying the pointees inside the callee is allowed, but the caller's parameter variables must not be modified.)\n- struct lfs_t / definition of lfs_t: needed to see members accessed (cfg, mlist). Knowing exact member names and types allows verifying how macros/functions use those members and whether any macro could rebind the `lfs` parameter symbol.\n- typedef/definition of lfs_file_t: required to understand how `file` is used and cast (to struct lfs_mlist*), and to check whether any macro/function interacts with `file` in a way that could modify the parameter itself.\n- struct lfs_mlist / definition of lfs_mlist: required because `file` is cast to (struct lfs_mlist*) for lfs_mlist_isopen; the definition may show macros or inline helpers that could be involved and potentially modify the parameter symbol if implemented as macros.\n\nThese symbols are sufficient to determine whether any macro expansions or in-place code invoked from this function can assign to or rebind the function parameters (lfs, file, size), which would violate the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified."
