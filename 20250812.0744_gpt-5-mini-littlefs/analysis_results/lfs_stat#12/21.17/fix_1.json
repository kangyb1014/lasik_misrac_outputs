  "explanation": "The compile error was caused by a mismatched function signature: the header (lfs.h) declares lfs_stat with concrete types (lfs_t * and struct lfs_info *), but the implementation used void pointers. I changed the lfs_stat definition to match the header: int lfs_stat(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path, struct lfs_info *info). No other logic was altered \u2014 only the parameter types were fixed so lfs->cfg and the locking/unlocking calls are valid and the build no longer reports conflicting types."
