  "explanation": "- lfs_stat_: The target function simply forwards to lfs_stat_. To determine whether any code in lfs_stat is unreachable you must inspect lfs_stat_ for non-local control flow (early returns, infinite loops, longjmp/exit/abort) that could make code after the call unreachable or that would imply unreachable code paths in lfs_stat itself.\\n- lfs_dir_find, lfs_tag_type3, lfs_dir_getinfo, lfs_tag_id: These are the static callees of lfs_stat_. Their implementations may contain non-local control flow (returns, loops, longjmp/exit) or unreachable code that affect reachability analysis of lfs_stat_ and therefore of lfs_stat.\\n- LFS_LOCK (macro/func): Expands/calls at the start of lfs_stat and can change control flow (may return an error, longjmp, assert/abort, etc.). You must see its definition to know whether later statements are always reachable.\\n- LFS_UNLOCK (macro/func): Called at the end of lfs_stat. Its behavior (especially if it can longjmp/abort) affects whether the function tail is reachable and whether any cleanup is skipped.\\n- LFS_TRACE (macro): Although usually harmless, trace macros can be implemented to include control-flow-affecting statements (e.g., assertion failures, return wrappers). Include its definition to be sure trace calls do not introduce unreachable code.\\n- struct lfs_t (including the type of lfs->cfg): Needed because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK take lfs->cfg; understanding their expanded code may require knowing the cfg type and any inline functions or macros operating on it.\\nThese symbols are the minimal set needed to analyse control flow and detect unreachable code related to the target function and its direct callees."
