  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA C const-pointer rule you must know whether any pointer parameters passed into or through lfs_stat are ever modified. Reasoning for each symbol:\n- lfs_stat_: The direct callee: its prototype and implementation show how the arguments (path, info) are used (read-only or modified). If lfs_stat_ takes non-const pointers or writes through them, lfs_stat\u2019s parameter qualifiers may be affected.\n- lfs_dir_find: Called by lfs_stat_. Its prototype/implementation reveal whether it modifies strings/buffers (e.g. path) or writes into structures passed by pointer.\n- lfs_dir_getinfo: Likely populates struct lfs_info; its signature/implementation are needed to confirm that info is modified (and therefore must be non-const) and how it is passed.\n- lfs_tag_type3 and lfs_tag_id: Callees of lfs_stat_ \u2014 their prototypes/implementations show whether they take any pointer arguments and whether they modify pointed-to objects or accept const pointers.\n- definition of lfs_t: You must know the exact type of the lfs parameter and its members (particularly cfg) to determine whether pointers held in it are const-qualified or passed to functions that modify data.\n- definition of struct lfs_info: To determine whether info should be const or non-const (i.e. whether callers/callees write into it) you need its layout and intended use.\n- definition/type of lfs->cfg (the cfg structure): lfs->cfg is passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; you must know its type to inspect LOCK/UNLOCK prototypes and whether those operations cast away const or modify the object.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definitions): They appear in lfs_stat and take lfs->cfg; you need to know if they require non-const pointers or perform casts/writes that affect const-correctness of cfg or lfs.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro or function definition): Used with path; the trace macro can cast or take non-const char* (e.g. performing writes or removing const), so its definition is necessary to ensure passing path (const char*) to it doesn't violate the rule.\n\nCollecting these symbols (declarations and implementations where relevant) lets the next analyst determine whether any pointer parameter should be const-qualified or must be non-const because the code writes through it or casts away const."
