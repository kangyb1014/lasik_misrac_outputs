  "explanation": "For MISRA rule checking of language extensions we must inspect any macros, typedefs or callees used by lfs_file_write because those definitions may themselves use compiler extensions (GCC/Clang builtins, statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, nested functions, __attribute__, inline asm, non\u2011standard variadic macro tricks, etc.). Explanations: \n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK: these are macros or inline helpers that operate on lfs->cfg; they commonly hide implementation idioms (statement-expressions, typeof, __builtin_*, attributes). Inspect to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are used. \n- LFS_TRACE: typically a macro wrapping a printf-like trace call; may be a variadic macro, use ##__VA_ARGS__ (GNU extension in some older compilers), or attach format attributes or use non\u2011standard builtins; must be checked. \n- LFS_ASSERT: assert-style macro may use compiler extensions (do/while wrappers are fine, but it could use static assertions, typeof, or compiler intrinsics). \n- struct lfs_config (lfs->cfg): the cfg structure definition may contain attributes, bit-field widths, or platform-specific types that are compiler extensions; LFS_LOCK/UNLOCK may reference internal fields. \n- lfs_ssize_t, lfs_size_t, lfs_t, lfs_file_t: the typedefs/type definitions must be inspected for use of implementation\u2011specific types or extensions (e.g. __int128, attributes, packed/aligned attributes). \n- PRIu32 / PRId32 and <inttypes.h>: the format macros expansion should be checked (they are standard, but the project may redefine them or use non\u2011standard macros). Include the header that defines them to ensure no extension is used. \n- lfs_mlist_isopen (declaration/definition): called inside an assertion; its prototype/definition must be checked for any language extensions (inline, attributes, statement-expr, nested function, etc.). \n- lfs_file_write_ (declaration/definition): the core work is delegated here; its prototype/definition must be inspected for extensions (inlines, attributes, GCC builtins, asm, statement-expr) because lfs_file_write itself is merely a wrapper.\n\nProvide these symbols/definitions to the next analyst so each macro, typedef and callee implementation can be examined for compiler-specific language extensions that would violate the MISRA requirement."
