  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_file_write violates the MISRA rule about const-qualified pointers we must know whether any pointer parameters that are declared const (or non-const) are actually modified by callees or whether they could have been declared const. The following symbols are required and why:\n\n- lfs_file_write_: This is the direct callee that receives the buffer and file arguments. We need its prototype and implementation to see whether it accepts the buffer as a const-qualified pointer or a non-const pointer, and to verify whether it (or its callees) ever modifies the object pointed to by buffer or modifies file via that pointer. If lfs_file_write_ takes a non-const pointer and writes into it, that would indicate a violation (caller passed const void*).\n\n- lfs_file_flushedwrite: One of lfs_file_write_\u2019s callees (per the static graph). We must inspect its prototype/implementation to confirm whether it modifies the buffer or any object reachable via the buffer pointer (e.g. by casting away const). Any modification in this chain is relevant to the const-correctness check.\n\n- lfs_file_flush: Another callee in the write path. While it may not take the buffer directly, it could operate on file state or on buffers passed through, so we must confirm it does not modify memory that was passed in as const.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called from lfs_file_write (via LFS_ASSERT). We need its prototype to confirm how file is passed (const or non-const) and whether it modifies the object pointed to by file. This is necessary to assess if the file parameter\u2019s non-const qualification is justified or if it could have been const.\n\n- lfs_file_t, lfs_t, struct lfs_mlist: The typedefs/struct definitions are needed to determine the exact pointer types involved (e.g. whether any of these are already typedefs to const-qualified pointers or contain const members) and to validate the cast (struct lfs_mlist*)file used in the ASSERT. Knowing these definitions helps determine whether any const is being stripped or ignored.\n\n- lfs_size_t, lfs_ssize_t: The size/return types are required to fully understand the prototypes of the functions above (signatures) so we can unambiguously determine parameter const-qualification and whether any implicit casts could affect constness.\n\nCollectively, these symbols provide the function prototypes and implementations needed to trace whether any pointer declared const in lfs_file_write (notably buffer) is modified by lfs_file_write_ or its callees, or whether any non-const pointer could safely be const. Without these, we cannot determine if const is respected or improperly stripped/modified, which is exactly what the MISRA check requires."
