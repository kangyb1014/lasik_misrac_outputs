  "explanation": "To determine whether any statements in lfs_file_write are statically unreachable you must inspect any called macros/functions that can alter control flow (return, abort, longjmp, infinite loop) or that have deterministic return values that would make subsequent statements never executed. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- LFS_LOCK: The function immediately tests the int result of LFS_LOCK and returns on non-zero. If LFS_LOCK is defined such that it always returns 0 (or always non-zero), or if it contains non-local control flow (return/abort/longjmp), parts of lfs_file_write may be unreachable. Must inspect its definition/semantics.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Called just before the final return. If LFS_UNLOCK contains non-local control flow (e.g., does not return, calls longjmp/abort/returns itself), the subsequent return res could be unreachable. Inspect to ensure it is a simple unlock.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: A macro used for logging; macros can expand to arbitrary code. If LFS_TRACE contains non-local control flow or is conditionally compiled out in a way that affects reachability reasoning, this must be checked.\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertions often expand to code that can abort or return in failure builds. If LFS_ASSERT can terminate or otherwise prevent subsequent statements from executing, it can make following code unreachable. Also check whether it compiles away and therefore has no control-flow effect.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen: Called inside the LFS_ASSERT expression. Its return value (and any side effects) matters for whether the assert triggers termination. If it has side-effects or a deterministic value that makes the assert always true/false, that affects reachability.\n\n- lfs_file_write_: The main work is delegated here. If lfs_file_write_ never returns (e.g., calls abort/longjmp/infinite loop) then the trace after the call and LFS_UNLOCK/return become unreachable. You must inspect its implementation to determine if it always returns normally.\n\n- lfs_file_flush and lfs_file_flushedwrite: These are callees of lfs_file_write_. To decide whether lfs_file_write_ can fail to return (or can always return a particular value), you must inspect its callees as well for non-local control flow or deterministic behavior that would affect reachability in the caller.\n\nInclude these definitions/implementations in the next-agent prompt so that it can determine whether any statements in lfs_file_write are unconditionally unreachable under the project build/configuration."
