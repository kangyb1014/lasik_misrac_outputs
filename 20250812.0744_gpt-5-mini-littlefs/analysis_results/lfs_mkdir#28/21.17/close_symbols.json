  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to check for out-of-bounds use of <string.h> functions:\n\n- lfs_mkdir_: The target wrapper calls this function \u2014 any string handling that could violate the rule will be inside lfs_mkdir_. You must inspect its body.\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_dir_find, lfs_path_islast, lfs_path_namelen, lfs_alloc_ckpoint, lfs_dir_alloc, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_pair_tole32, lfs_dir_commit, lfs_pair_fromle32, lfs_fs_preporphans: These are the direct callees of lfs_mkdir_ (from the static call graph). Any of these may perform buffer copies, length calculations, or other string/byte operations (path parsing, directory entry manipulation, pair/LE conversions, checkpoint allocation) that could use memcpy/strcpy/etc. You must examine their implementations to see whether they call string.h functions and whether their pointer/length usage can go out of bounds.\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: The wrapper uses these macros/functions to lock/unlock lfs->cfg. They may affect concurrency or provide access to buffered storage; include their definitions to rule out hidden string operations or to understand lifetime/ownership of buffers used by callees.\n- LFS_TRACE: The trace macro/function is called with the path string. It may perform formatting or internal string operations (e.g., snprintf/strlen) that could touch the path buffer; include its definition to ensure it does not access beyond the provided string.\n- lfs_t (type) and lfs->cfg (configuration type): The layout of lfs_t and its cfg member determine buffer ownership, sizes, and pointers passed into callees. You need these type definitions to understand what buffers (and their sizes) are available and whether pointer arithmetic in callees could overflow.\n- struct lfs_dir, lfs_pair_t / pair structures, checkpoint/ckpoint structures: Directory, pair and checkpoint data structures appear in the lfs_mkdir_ call tree; their sizes/fields are needed to check any memcpy/memmove or manual byte accesses inside the callees.\n- string.h functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn): Explicitly list the standard string functions covered by the MISRA rule so the analyser can search for their use in the above functions and check each call site for correct length/bound computation.\n\nIn short: include lfs_mkdir_ and the full set of its callees (and their dependent data-structures and locking/trace macros), plus the standard string.h functions \u2014 inspect all these to determine whether any use of string/byte-copying routines can access memory beyond the referenced objects."
