  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required:\n- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro (or inline helper) invoked at the top of the function. Macros implementing locks often use compiler extensions (GCC statement-expressions ({ ... }), typeof, builtin atomics, inline asm, or extension attributes). You must inspect its definition to determine if any compiler-specific extensions are used.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK; its expansion may use the same or other extensions. Inspecting its definition is necessary to decide if the target function uses language extensions via these macros.\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macros frequently expand to variadic constructs, format-attribute annotations, or platform-specific builtins/attributes. Although variadic macros are standard in C99, some trace macros use GCC extensions (e.g. ##__VA_ARGS__, statement-expressions, __builtin_ functions). Check its definition to rule out extensions.\n- lfs_mkdir_: The called function's declaration/definition may carry compiler-specific attributes (e.g. __attribute__((...))) or use calling-convention extensions. Inspecting its prototype/definition is necessary to see if the call site in lfs_mkdir relies on any extension-visible constructs.\n- lfs_t (type / struct definition): The function casts and dereferences an lfs_t pointer (lfs->cfg). The lfs_t definition may use language extensions (anonymous unions/structs, compiler-specific alignment or packed attributes, extensions in member declarations). You need the type to determine whether the target function's use of lfs_t involves any extensions.\n- type of lfs->cfg (configuration struct/typedef): The macros LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK take lfs->cfg; the cfg type may carry extension usage (function pointers with attributes, inline asm members, or macros that expand to extension-using code). Inspecting the cfg type/definition is needed to fully determine whether the target function (through its macros) uses language extensions.\n\nIn short: inspect the macro definitions used here and the types/declarations they reference (lfs_t, its cfg, and the called function lfs_mkdir_) because language extensions are most likely introduced via macro expansions, attributes on declarations, or non-standard type/struct constructs."
