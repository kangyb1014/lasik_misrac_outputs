  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_mkdir code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/227.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_mkdir as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_mkdir:\n```c\nint lfs_mkdir(lfs_t *lfs, const char *path) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_mkdir(%p, \\\"%s\\\")\", (void*)lfs, path);\n\n    err = lfs_mkdir_(lfs, path);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_mkdir -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_mkdir code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: 'path' is declared as const char * indicating the pointer points to a const-qualified type where appropriate. The 'lfs' parameter is a non-const lfs_t * which is correct because the function (and called helpers) use and modify the object (calls LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg) and lfs_mkdir_(lfs, path)). Therefore the code complies with MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.",
