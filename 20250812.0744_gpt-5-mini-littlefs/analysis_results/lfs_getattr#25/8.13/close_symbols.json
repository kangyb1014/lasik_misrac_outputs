  "explanation": "To decide whether any pointer parameter of lfs_getattr should be const-qualified (MISRA rule), the analyzer must know whether those pointers are ever used to modify the pointed objects. lfs_getattr simply forwards to lfs_getattr_, so the implementation and signature of lfs_getattr_ are primary. lfs_getattr_ calls lfs_dir_find, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get and the tag/utility functions (lfs_tag_id, lfs_tag_size, lfs_min) \u2014 any of these may read from or write to memory pointed to by 'path' or 'buffer'. Therefore their implementations and signatures are required to see whether they take const-qualified pointers or perform writes. The concrete type definitions (lfs_t, lfs_ssize_t, lfs_size_t) are required to understand pointer/return semantics and whether any embedded pointers inside lfs_t or related structs are const. The set of attribute type constants (the meanings of the 'type' parameter) is required because some attribute kinds may require buffer to be an output (written) while others are read-only; that determines whether buffer must be non-const. Finally, the prototypes and definitions of any directory/attribute data structures passed via 'buffer' are needed to see whether those structures are populated (written) by the call chain. With these symbols an auditor can trace whether 'path' or 'buffer' are written and thus whether const-qualification is required or must be omitted."
