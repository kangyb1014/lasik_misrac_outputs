  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The code you provided (lfs_getattr) contains no memcmp calls, and the agent\u2019s allegation references lfs_dir_find rather than the shown function, so there is a mismatch between the reported location and the supplied code. More importantly, MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 forbids using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated C strings (i.e. treating memcmp as a string comparison routine). The idiom memcmp(name, \".\", 1) or memcmp(name, \"..\", 2) compares fixed numbers of bytes and is typically used to compare a length-known name buffer (not a null\u2011terminated C string) against the corresponding bytes of a literal. That is a fixed\u2011length memory comparison, not a null\u2011terminated string comparison, and therefore does not per se violate Rule 21.14. (If the code were using memcmp with strlen or otherwise relying on NUL termination to determine the length, that would be a violation.) Also, your test probe produced no log entries so there is no evidence showing the stated memcmp calls are exercised. In summary: the claim that the shown code violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 is not supported and is false."
