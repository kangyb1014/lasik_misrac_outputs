  "explanation": "To determine whether lfs_getattr (via lfs_getattr_) violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings you must inspect the callee code that operates on path/names and any call sites of memory/string comparison routines. Reasons: \n- lfs_getattr_: the direct implementation called by lfs_getattr; it receives the path and is the primary place where string/name comparison could occur.\n- lfs_dir_find: likely searches directory entries by name; a prime candidate to compare a null\u2011terminated path/name against stored names.\n- lfs_dir_fetch / lfs_dir_get: directory access helpers that may retrieve name buffers or perform comparisons; needed to trace how name buffers are produced and compared.\n- lfs_tag_id / lfs_tag_size: called by lfs_getattr_; may manipulate/interpret entry metadata that affects how comparisons are done (lengths, IDs) and thus whether memcmp is being (mis)used.\n- lfs_min: utility used for length computations; needed to see if comparisons use computed lengths (which would be acceptable) or full memcmp over null\u2011terminated strings.\n- memcmp: the Standard C function in question; you must find all uses of memcmp in the code reachable from lfs_getattr_ to see if it is used on null\u2011terminated strings.\n- strncmp / strcmp / strlen: other standard string functions that may be used instead of memcmp or may appear in the same code paths; presence of these calls helps determine intent (bytewise vs null\u2011terminated comparison) and aids reasoning about any memcmp uses (e.g., if lengths from strlen are used with memcmp, that may still violate MISRA if comparing NUL\u2011terminated strings).\n\nInclude these symbols (their source files and definitions) so the next analyst can inspect call sites, argument origins and lengths to determine whether any memcmp calls compare null\u2011terminated strings (a MISRA violation)."
