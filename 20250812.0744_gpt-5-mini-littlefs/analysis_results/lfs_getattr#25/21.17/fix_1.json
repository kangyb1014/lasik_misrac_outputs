  "explanation": "The compilation error was caused by an unterminated string literal in the fprintf call that spanned a source-line break. I fixed it by splitting the diagnostic message into two adjacent string literals (which the C compiler concatenates) and escaping the embedded newlines (\\n). No other logic was changed."
