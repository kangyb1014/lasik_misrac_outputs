  "explanation": "lfs_getattr_: need the prototype and any function attributes (e.g. __noreturn) or documented behavior (can it longjmp/exit/loop forever). If lfs_getattr_ can be non-returning then the subsequent LFS_TRACE/LFS_UNLOCK/return in lfs_getattr would be unreachable. LFS_LOCK: need macro or function definition and return semantics. The early return (if (err) return err;) depends on LFS_LOCK expansion/behavior \u2014 if it is a compile-time constant, inline-returning macro, or never-fails, that affects reachability of the early-return branch. LFS_UNLOCK: need macro or function definition and side effects; if it is required to be called on all paths or is non-returning, that changes reachability of code after the lfs_getattr_ call. LFS_TRACE: need macro definition because it may expand to code that does not return (e.g. asserts, aborts) or may be compiled out; that affects whether trace calls are reachable. struct lfs (including cfg member): need the type of lfs->cfg because that is the argument to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK \u2014 their expansion may reference cfg fields or be conditionally compiled based on cfg, affecting whether the early return or unlock call is reachable. lfs_ssize_t and lfs_size_t typedefs: need the exact typedefs to ensure correct interpretation of return/value types (and whether return err; is type-compatible) and to detect any macros/attributes on those typedefs that could affect control flow analysis. These symbols are sufficient to determine whether any statements in lfs_getattr are provably unreachable (e.g. unreachable unlock/trace/return) given the actual definitions/attributes of the called macros/functions."
