  "explanation": "To decide whether any statements in lfs_dir_seek are unreachable you must know all macros/functions that can alter control flow or never return, and the callee behavior. Explanations: - LFS_LOCK: macro/function invoked at the start \u2014 it may return error codes, longjmp/exit, or otherwise not return; its semantics determine reachability of everything after the call and of the if (err) return branch. - LFS_UNLOCK: executed near the end; if it can fail or not return (or perform a non-local jump) the final return or subsequent code would be unreachable. - LFS_TRACE: logging macro/function \u2014 may expand to nothing or to calls that could affect control flow in unusual builds; need its definition to rule out hidden non-return behavior. - lfs_dir_seek_: the direct callee \u2014 if it does not return (calls exit/longjmp/etc.) then the trace/unlock/return lines after the call become unreachable; its implementation is required. - lfs_dir_rewind_, lfs_min, lfs_pair_cmp, lfs_dir_fetch: transitive callees of lfs_dir_seek_ shown in the static call graph \u2014 they must be examined to find any non-local exits or unconditional infinite loops that make code after the call unreachable. - lfs_t (type/definition) and lfs_dir_t (type/definition): needed to resolve lfs->cfg and any macros that depend on structure layout or inline functions that could affect control flow. - cfg type (the type of lfs->cfg): LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK likely operate on this; its definition may reveal function pointers or callbacks that perform non-local exits. - exit, abort, longjmp and any project-specific panic/assert (e.g. lfs_panic, LFS_ASSERT): commonly-used non-local-exit functions; if any of the above symbols or their callees call these, code following the call becomes unreachable. Examining these symbols allows a precise determination whether any statements in lfs_dir_seek are provably never reached and thus would violate the MISRA rule against unreachable code."
