  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: could be a macro (or inline function) that hides compiler extensions (e.g. statement-expressions, typeof, inline asm, __attribute__, GCC/Clang builtins). You must inspect its definition to decide if the call in lfs_dir_seek uses any language extensions.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2013 the unlock operation may be implemented as a macro or function using compiler-specific extensions.\n- LFS_TRACE: a logging macro is commonly implemented with variadic macros, statement-expressions, or compiler attributes/builtins (__attribute__, __builtin_*, etc.). Its definition must be checked for any non\u2011standard extensions.\n- PRIu32: the format macro comes from <inttypes.h>. Although standard, its expansion and use in concatenated string literals should be verified in the build environment to ensure no implementation\u2011specific extension is introduced.\n- lfs_t: the type of the first parameter; its struct definition may contain compiler extensions (anonymous/unnamed structs/unions, __attribute__(packed), bitfields with implementation\u2011specific widths, etc.) that affect whether the code uses language extensions.\n- lfs_dir_t: same as lfs_t \u2014 its typedef/struct definition may include extensions that are used when the parameter is referenced.\n- lfs_off_t: the integer typedef for off; its definition (e.g. as a compiler-specific fixed-width type or using attributes) must be inspected to ensure no extension is used.\n- lfs_dir_seek_: the called function\u2019s prototype/definition should be checked because it may be a macro or inline function with attributes (always_inline, nonstandard linkage attributes) or other extensions that affect the compiled code for lfs_dir_seek.\n\nThese symbols provide the macro/type/function definitions that determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are present in the target function\u2019s implementation. Inspecting them is necessary to conclude compliance with the MISRA rule about language extensions."
