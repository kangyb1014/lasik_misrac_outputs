  "explanation": "- lfs_dir_seek_: The target function delegates all directory-seeking work to this internal function. Any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings will occur (if at all) inside lfs_dir_seek_, so its body must be inspected.\\n- lfs_dir_rewind_: Called by lfs_dir_seek_. It may perform comparisons or fetch directory entries; inspect it to see if memcmp is used to compare names.\\n- lfs_min: A helper used by lfs_dir_seek_. While unlikely to call memcmp itself, its use could affect length arguments passed to comparisons (e.g., choosing lengths for memcmp/strncmp). Include it to understand how comparison lengths are derived.\\n- lfs_pair_cmp: Likely responsible for comparing directory entry keys/names. This is the highest-risk function for violating the rule (memcmp used to compare names). Its implementation and how it computes/obtains lengths is required.\\n- lfs_dir_fetch: Fetches directory entries (including name buffers and lengths) used by comparison routines. You must inspect how names are returned (null-terminated or length-prefixed) to determine whether memcmp is being used on null-terminated strings.\\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function the MISRA rule restricts. You must examine any uses of memcmp in the above functions to determine whether it is being applied to null-terminated strings (the rule violation).\\n- definitions of directory-entry / name storage (struct(s) and fields used by lfs_pair_cmp and lfs_dir_fetch): To decide whether a memcmp call compares null-terminated strings you need the exact layout and semantics of the name buffers (are they NUL-terminated C-strings, or length-prefixed raw buffers?) and any associated length fields. Include the struct(s) and field names/types used by lfs_pair_cmp and lfs_dir_fetch so the next analyser can determine whether memcmp is comparing null-terminated strings."
