  "explanation": "You must determine whether the function's formal parameters (the pointer variables lfs and dir, and the scalar off) are ever assigned to inside lfs_dir_seek (or by textual macro expansion). Include:\n\n- LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK: these are macros invoked in lfs_dir_seek. Macros are expanded into the caller's scope and could contain assignments to the parameter names (for example indirectly assigning to lfs or dir). To prove no parameter variable is modified you must inspect their macro definitions and expansions.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: variadic tracing macro is passed the parameter names (lfs, dir, off). As a macro it can also expand into code that assigns to those identifiers in the caller scope; include its definition to verify it does not modify the parameters.\n\n- lfs_dir_seek_: the target calls this symbol. If it is a function, it cannot reassign the caller's parameter variables, but if it is a macro (or inline textually expanded), it could. You need the declaration/definition to determine whether it is a real function or a macro/inline expansion that could modify the caller's parameters.\n\n- lfs_dir_rewind_, lfs_min, lfs_pair_cmp, lfs_dir_fetch: these are callees of lfs_dir_seek_. If lfs_dir_seek_ turns out to be a macro or inline body, its internal calls/expansion may reassign the parameter identifiers. Include their definitions to trace any assignments inside the expanded body.\n\n- lfs_t, lfs_dir_t, lfs_off_t: the type definitions are required to know whether any parameter is actually a pointer type alias (e.g. if lfs_off_t were a pointer typedef then off would be a pointer parameter and the rule applies differently). Also to inspect any field accesses (e.g. lfs->cfg) used as macro arguments and to determine whether an apparent modification is to the pointer variable itself or to the object it points to.\n\nCollecting these symbols (macro definitions and function bodies/type defs) lets the next analyst determine whether any of the formal parameter identifiers are ever assigned to (directly or via macro expansion) in lfs_dir_seek, which would violate the MISRA rule."
