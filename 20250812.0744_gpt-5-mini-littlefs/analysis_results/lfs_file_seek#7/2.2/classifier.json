  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_file_seek code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/58.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_file_seek as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_file_seek:\n```c\nlfs_soff_t lfs_file_seek(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        lfs_soff_t off, int whence) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_seek(%p, %p, %\"PRId32\", %d)\",\n            (void*)lfs, (void*)file, off, whence);\n    LFS_ASSERT(lfs_mlist_isopen(lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file));\n\n    lfs_soff_t res = lfs_file_seek_(lfs, file, off, whence);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_file_seek -> %\"PRId32, res);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return res;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_file_seek:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define LFS_ASSERT(test) assert(test)\n...\nstatic bool lfs_mlist_isopen(struct lfs_mlist *head,\n        struct lfs_mlist *node) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &head; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == (struct lfs_mlist*)node) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n...\nstatic lfs_soff_t lfs_file_seek_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file,\n        lfs_soff_t off, int whence) {\n    // find new pos\n    //\n    // fortunately for us, littlefs is limited to 31-bit file sizes, so we\n    // don't have to worry too much about integer overflow\n    lfs_off_t npos = file->pos;\n    if (whence == LFS_SEEK_SET) {\n        npos = off;\n    } else if (whence == LFS_SEEK_CUR) {\n        npos = file->pos + (lfs_off_t)off;\n    } else if (whence == LFS_SEEK_END) {\n        npos = (lfs_off_t)lfs_file_size_(lfs, file) + (lfs_off_t)off;\n    }\n\n    if (npos > lfs->file_max) {\n        // file position out of range\n        return LFS_ERR_INVAL;\n    }\n\n    if (file->pos == npos) {\n        // noop - position has not changed\n        return npos;\n    }\n\n    // if we're only reading and our new offset is still in the file's cache\n    // we can avoid flushing and needing to reread the data\n    if ((file->flags & LFS_F_READING)\n            && file->off != lfs->cfg->block_size) {\n        int oindex = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &(lfs_off_t){file->pos});\n        lfs_off_t noff = npos;\n        int nindex = lfs_ctz_index(lfs, &noff);\n        if (oindex == nindex\n                && noff >= file->cache.off\n                && noff < file->cache.off + file->cache.size) {\n            file->pos = npos;\n            file->off = noff;\n            return npos;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // write out everything beforehand, may be noop if rdonly\n    int err = lfs_file_flush(lfs, file);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    // update pos\n    file->pos = npos;\n    return npos;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_file_seek code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
