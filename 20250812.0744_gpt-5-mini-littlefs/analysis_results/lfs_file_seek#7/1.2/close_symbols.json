  "explanation": "Reasoning for each symbol (why its definition must be inspected to decide if the target uses language extensions):\n\n- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro (used as LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg)). Macros commonly use compiler extensions (statement-expression ({ ... }), typeof, inline asm, __attribute__, GCC/clang variadic-arg token pasting like ##__VA_ARGS__, builtin intrinsics, etc.). You must inspect its definition to ensure it does not introduce language extensions into the call site.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK: it is a macro used in the function epilogue and may hide compiler-specific constructs.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Logging macros frequently use variadic macros, token-pasting, statement-expressions, or attributes. The format string uses the PRId32 macro inside a string literal; the macro expansion of LFS_TRACE itself must be checked for extensions (e.g. use of GNU asm, __attribute__, statement-expression, or non-standard preprocessing hacks).\n\n- LFS_ASSERT: Assertion macros often use statement-expressions, __func__/__PRETTY_FUNCTION__, or call compiler builtins; inspect to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are used in the assertion expansion.\n\n- PRId32: This macro is expanded into text inside a format string (\"%\" PRId32). Although normally from <inttypes.h> (standard), some platforms/headers could implement it using non-standard constructs; inspect to confirm it is standard-conforming in this project.\n\n- lfs_soff_t: The return type used by the function. Its typedef/definition could be an implementation-specific integer type (e.g. using __int128 or other compiler-specific types) or use attributes; inspect to confirm no language extensions are used in the type definition.\n\n- lfs_t: The filesystem context type. Its definition may include compiler extensions (bitfields with implementation-defined widths, attributes, packed/aligned pragmas, anonymous structs/unions that are extensions in some compilers, or other non-standard constructs). Inspect its definition.\n\n- lfs_file_t: File object type (used as parameter). Its definition could contain compiler-specific constructs (anonymous structs/unions, attributes, extension types). Inspect it.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist: The function casts to (struct lfs_mlist*) and calls lfs_mlist_isopen with that cast; the struct definition may use anonymous/unnamed members or other compiler extensions. Inspect its declaration/definition.\n\n- lfs_file_seek_: Although a callee (function), its declaration/definition should be checked to ensure it is a normal function (not a macro or an inline with compiler-specific attributes) and that its prototype does not use language extensions that would affect the call site.\n\nInspecting these symbols (macro definitions and type declarations) is sufficient to determine whether this target function uses any compiler language extensions via macros, typedefs, attributes, or non-standard constructs."
