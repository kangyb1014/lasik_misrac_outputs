  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked with lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK is a macro (or inline) its expansion could reference or assign the identifier 'lfs' (or otherwise modify the local parameter). We must inspect its definition to ensure it does not modify the function parameter 'lfs'.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same reasoning as LFS_LOCK for the unlock call at function end; its expansion could modify the parameter if it is a macro.\n- LFS_TRACE: Often a macro that expands to code (e.g. logging) and could reference identifiers in the call site; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not assign to 'lfs'.\n- lfs_unmount_ (definition/implementation): Although a normal function cannot change the caller's parameter variable, lfs_unmount_ might be a macro/inline or have side effects that are implemented via macros. Inspecting its definition confirms whether any expansion can modify the 'lfs' parameter in this scope.\n- definition of type lfs_t (struct) including member 'cfg' and its type: Knowing the layout and type of lfs->cfg is necessary to understand how LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE are used and whether any of their implementations might treat the expression in a way that can modify 'lfs' (e.g. via unusual macros or overloaded operators in C-like constructs).\n- any macros / helper symbols expanded inside LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, or LFS_TRACE: If those macros expand further to helper macros or functions, those expansions must be inspected as well to ensure no assignment to the parameter 'lfs' occurs.\n\nThese symbols collectively let the next analyzer determine whether any code executed in the body of lfs_unmount (including macro expansions and the called lfs_unmount_ implementation) assigns to or otherwise modifies the parameter variable 'lfs', which would violate the MISRA rule."
