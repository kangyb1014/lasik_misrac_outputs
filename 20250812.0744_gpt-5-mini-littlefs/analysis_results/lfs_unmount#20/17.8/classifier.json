  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_unmount code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/165.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_unmount as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_unmount:\n```c\nint lfs_unmount(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_unmount(%p)\", (void*)lfs);\n\n    err = lfs_unmount_(lfs);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_unmount -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_unmount:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nuint8_t type\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_unmount code violates the rule 17.8 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the function parameter 'lfs' (a pointer) is not modified in lfs_unmount. The code reads lfs->cfg, passes lfs to lfs_unmount_, and uses lfs only in tracing; it does not assign to the parameter or change the pointer value. The macros shown (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE) do not modify the parameter itself. Therefore Rule 17.8 is not violated.",
