  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is a macro/function used directly in the target. Its definition must be inspected to see if it uses compiler extensions (statement-expressions ({...}), typeof, __builtin_*, __attribute__, inline-asm, __extension__, GCC variadic/format attributes, etc.).\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 its actual expansion/definition may contain compiler-specific extensions.\n- LFS_TRACE: This macro is used with a format string and a cast; trace/logging macros commonly use variadic macros, GCC/MSC extensions or attributes. You must see its definition to determine if it relies on non-standard language extensions.\n- lfs_unmount_ (definition): Although called rather than expanded in-place, the declaration or definition of lfs_unmount_ might carry compiler-specific function attributes or use extension-only constructs in an inline definition that affect the call site or require extension knowledge.\n- lfs_t (type/definition): The type of the parameter may be defined using compiler extensions (packed/aligned attributes, bit-fields with implementation-defined widths, anonymous structures/unions if considered an extension by some compilers). Inspecting the type ensures no extension use in the function signature or member access.\n- lfs->cfg (type/definition, e.g. struct lfs_config): The cfg member's type is passed to LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK; its definition (and any macros around it) may contain extensions that the lock/unlock macros rely on. Knowing this type is necessary to fully analyze whether the macros/uses introduce language extensions.\n\nThese symbols collectively cover all macro expansions, type definitions, and called-function declarations that can introduce compiler-specific language extensions affecting whether the target function violates the MISRA rule."
