  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2 is: Language extensions should not be used.\nYou should report only when the code uses any language compiler extensions that are explicitly stated as an extension in compiler documentations.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_unmount code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/160.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_unmount as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_unmount:\n```c\nint lfs_unmount(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_unmount(%p)\", (void*)lfs);\n\n    err = lfs_unmount_(lfs);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_unmount -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_unmount:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_unmount code violates the rule 1.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No language extensions are used. The code uses standard C constructs: function definition, pointer casting, the comma operator, and macros. The provided macros (LFS_LOCK, LFS_UNLOCK) use standard comma operator and (void) cast; LFS_TRACE uses a variadic macro (__VA_ARGS__), which is part of standard C99 and later, not a compiler-specific extension. No compiler-specific keywords or nonstandard attributes are present, so Rule 1.2 is not violated.",
