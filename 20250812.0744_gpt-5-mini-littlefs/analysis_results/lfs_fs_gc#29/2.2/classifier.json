  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified lfs_fs_gc code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/234.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_fs_gc as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_fs_gc:\n```c\nint lfs_fs_gc(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_gc(%p)\", (void*)lfs);\n\n    err = lfs_fs_gc_(lfs);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_fs_gc -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_fs_gc:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic int lfs_fs_forceconsistency(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    int err = lfs_fs_desuperblock(lfs);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    err = lfs_fs_demove(lfs);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    err = lfs_fs_deorphan(lfs, true);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n...\nstatic inline bool lfs_pair_isnull(const lfs_block_t pair[2]) {\n    return pair[0] == LFS_BLOCK_NULL || pair[1] == LFS_BLOCK_NULL;\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_dir_fetch(lfs_t *lfs,\n        lfs_mdir_t *dir, const lfs_block_t pair[2]) {\n    // note, mask=-1, tag=-1 can never match a tag since this\n    // pattern has the invalid bit set\n    return (int)lfs_dir_fetchmatch(lfs, dir, pair,\n            (lfs_tag_t)-1, (lfs_tag_t)-1, NULL, NULL, NULL);\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_dir_commit(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_mdir_t *dir,\n        const struct lfs_mattr *attrs, int attrcount) {\n    int orphans = lfs_dir_orphaningcommit(lfs, dir, attrs, attrcount);\n    if (orphans < 0) {\n        return orphans;\n    }\n\n    if (orphans) {\n        // make sure we've removed all orphans, this is a noop if there\n        // are none, but if we had nested blocks failures we may have\n        // created some\n        int err = lfs_fs_deorphan(lfs, false);\n        if (err) {\n            return err;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n...\nstatic int lfs_alloc_scan(lfs_t *lfs) {\n    // move lookahead buffer to the first unused block\n    //\n    // note we limit the lookahead buffer to at most the amount of blocks\n    // checkpointed, this prevents the math in lfs_alloc from underflowing\n    lfs->lookahead.start = (lfs->lookahead.start + lfs->lookahead.next) \n            % lfs->block_count;\n    lfs->lookahead.next = 0;\n    lfs->lookahead.size = lfs_min(\n            8*lfs->cfg->lookahead_size,\n            lfs->lookahead.ckpoint);\n\n    // find mask of free blocks from tree\n    memset(lfs->lookahead.buffer, 0, lfs->cfg->lookahead_size);\n    int err = lfs_fs_traverse_(lfs, lfs_alloc_lookahead, lfs, true);\n    if (err) {\n        lfs_alloc_drop(lfs);\n        return err;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above lfs_fs_gc code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The function does not contain executed operations that can be removed without changing program behaviour. LFS_LOCK is a macro that evaluates to 0 so the if (err) branch is effectively unreachable (and note 2 of the rule states unreachable code is not considered dead code). The LFS_TRACE macros are empty and removed at preprocessing (they are not executed), and LFS_UNLOCK and LFS_LOCK expand to harmless expressions with no side-effects in the provided definitions. The remaining calls (lfs_fs_gc_) and the final return are live and affect behaviour, so Rule 2.2 is not violated.",
