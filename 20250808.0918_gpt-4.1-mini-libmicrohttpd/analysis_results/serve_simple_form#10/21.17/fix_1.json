  "explanation": "The compilation issue stems from a missing cast when assigning the void pointer 'cls' to the 'const char *form' variable. In C, assigning a void pointer to a pointer of another type without a cast may cause a compilation error, especially in C++ or strict C compilers. Adding an explicit cast '(const char *)cls' fixes the issue and preserves the original logic. No other changes were necessary as the rest of the code is consistent and the build errors shown relate to missing external tool 'makeinfo', not the code itself."
