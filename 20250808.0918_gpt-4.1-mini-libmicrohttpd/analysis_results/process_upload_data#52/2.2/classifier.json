  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified process_upload_data code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/418.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of process_upload_data as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of process_upload_data:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nprocess_upload_data (void *cls,\n                     enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                     const char *key,\n                     const char *filename,\n                     const char *content_type,\n                     const char *transfer_encoding,\n                     const char *data,\n                     uint64_t off,\n                     size_t size)\n{\n  struct UploadContext *uc = cls;\n  size_t i;\n  int res;\n  (void) kind;              /* Unused.

  "scenario": "The variable 'res' is assigned the result of 'snprintf' to create a file path, and later the same variable 'res' is reused to hold the result of another 'snprintf' call (building the final filename path). The first assigned value in 'res' is never used apart from the immediate conditional check and overwritten before use. However, this reuse of 'res' does not constitute dead code by itself. There is no operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behavior. All code paths and operations contribute to the functional behavior of the upload processing logic.",
