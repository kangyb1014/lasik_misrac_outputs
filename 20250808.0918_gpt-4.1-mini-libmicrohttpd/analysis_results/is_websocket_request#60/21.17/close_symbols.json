  "explanation": "The target function calls strcmp and strstr from <string.h> which are string handling functions. To analyze compliance with the MISRA C rule regarding bounds access for these functions, their behaviors must be understood. WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is a string constant used as the second argument to strcmp, so its definition or value is required to ensure it is a valid string object with properly null-terminated bounds. Without knowing WS_UPGRADE_VALUE's value or definition, it is impossible to confirm if strcmp accesses beyond its bounds. The pointer parameters upg_header and con_header are inputs from elsewhere, but WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is internal and must be known. Similarly, strstr is called on con_header with a constant string \"Upgrade\"; the constant string is a known static string literal and safe, but the analyzed symbol WS_UPGRADE_VALUE's integrity as a null-terminated string needs confirmation. Hence, WS_UPGRADE_VALUE plus knowledge of strcmp and strstr semantics are necessary to fully analyze potential out-of-bounds access in the target function."
