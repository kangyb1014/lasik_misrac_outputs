The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To analyze whether the function is_websocket_request contains dead code, we need to understand all operations that affect its behavior. The function compares upg_header with WS_UPGRADE_VALUE using strcmp, and searches con_header for the string \"Upgrade\" using strstr. Hence, the symbol WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is required to determine the actual value compared and if that comparison ever causes the function to behave differently. The functions strcmp and strstr are standard library functions used in conditional checks; knowing their behavior is crucial to assess whether the conditions can be optimized away or if all operations are essential. Since the function has no internal unused operations and simply returns a conditional value, no other additional symbols are necessary to analyze potential dead code within it."
