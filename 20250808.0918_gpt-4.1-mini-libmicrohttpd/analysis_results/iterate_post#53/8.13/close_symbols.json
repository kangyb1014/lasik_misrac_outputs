  "explanation": "To analyze the target function for the MISRA C rule about const-correctness of pointers, the following symbols are needed: \n- MHD_ValueKind: To understand the type and possible const qualification of the 'kind' parameter, even though unused.\n- struct connection_info_struct: Because the function modifies the answerstring field of the struct via a pointer, understanding whether this pointer is to const or non-const data is important.\n- MAXNAMESIZE and MAXANSWERSIZE: These constants define buffer sizes used in memory allocation and checks, influencing the size of modified data.\n- GREETINGPAGE: This format string is used in snprintf modifying the allocated data; its type and usage affect const-correctness.\n- MHD_Result, MHD_NO, MHD_YES: These define the return values and may influence control flow relevant to the pointer usage.\n- strcmp, malloc, snprintf: The function calls these library functions; their behavior with regard to const pointers must be understood to verify compliance.\nThese symbols are essential to evaluate if pointers in the function properly respect const qualifications and whether any pointer is mistakenly pointing to const data that the function tries to modify."
