  "explanation": "To analyze if this function contains unreachable code (per MISRA C rule), we must understand the behavior of the called functions and constants/macros. strcmp is needed to evaluate the conditional that branches the flow. malloc and snprintf affect whether the function returns early or continues. MAXNAMESIZE, MAXANSWERSIZE, and GREETINGPAGE influence the branching and memory allocation logic. struct connection_info_struct is required because an assignment's side effects may affect reachability. The enum MHD_Result and constants MHD_NO, MHD_YES are needed to interpret the return values and verify all return paths are reachable and correctly implemented."
