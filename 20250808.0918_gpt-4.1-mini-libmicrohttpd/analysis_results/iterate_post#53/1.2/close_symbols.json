  "explanation": "To analyze whether the iterate_post function violates the MISRA C rule against language extensions, the following symbols are required: 1. MHD_Result, MHD_NO, MHD_YES: Understanding these enums and constants is necessary to verify if their definitions use any language extensions. 2. struct connection_info_struct: Its definition may involve compiler-specific extensions or attribute usages. 3. MAXNAMESIZE, MAXANSWERSIZE: These macros determine buffer sizes. Their definitions need to be inspected for possible extensions. 4. GREETINGPAGE: This macro or constant string is used in snprintf. Its definition may include extensions. 5. malloc, snprintf, strcmp: These standard library functions should be inspected to confirm they are standard and not replaced by extension-based versions or macros. Collectively, these symbols provide all relevant context\u2014types, constants, macros, functions\u2014to check for violations of language extensions within the target function."
