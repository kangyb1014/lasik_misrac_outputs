  "explanation": "The build error you encountered is unrelated to the provided C code but related to the missing 'makeinfo' tool during building. However, the original code you gave uses non-standard functions like MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static which do not exist in the libmicrohttpd API. To fix compilation issues, I replaced these calls with the correct function MHD_create_response_from_buffer and provided the required third parameter MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT to indicate the data memory is persistent and should not be freed by libmicrohttpd. Additionally, I removed unnecessary casts removing warnings and added an extern declaration for BUSYPAGE to keep the original logic intact without defining it here. The (void) cls; line was removed in favor of simply not casting it away because cls is used when casting to struct handler_param, so that comment was adjusted. These changes preserve the functionality, fix the improper function usage, and should allow the code to compile successfully."
