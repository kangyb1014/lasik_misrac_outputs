  "explanation": "To analyze if the target function 'run_usock' violates the MISRA C rule regarding the use of 'memcmp' for null-terminated strings, we need to understand all string or buffer handling that occurs inside 'run_usock'. The function calls 'ws_receive_frame' and 'ws_send_frame' which likely handle WebSocket frames and potentially involve comparisons or manipulations of strings; their code is necessary to check for forbidden 'memcmp' usage. The 'send_all' function is called indirectly via 'ws_send_frame' and may involve buffer transmission and possible string comparisons. 'make_blocking' influences socket mode but does not directly involve strings; however, including it ensures full context. 'MHD_upgrade_action' and its callee 'MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_' are involved in connection handling, and their implementation may include string comparisons, so they must be inspected. The mutex 'MUTEX', 'CLIENT_SOCKS', and 'MHD_INVALID_SOCKET' are used for managing client sockets and synchronization; while not directly related to string comparisons, their definitions help fully understand resource management and may clarify if string comparison happens implicitly in cleanup. Including these symbols ensures a comprehensive view of all functions and data that may perform or relate to forbidden 'memcmp' usage on strings within the execution path of 'run_usock'."
