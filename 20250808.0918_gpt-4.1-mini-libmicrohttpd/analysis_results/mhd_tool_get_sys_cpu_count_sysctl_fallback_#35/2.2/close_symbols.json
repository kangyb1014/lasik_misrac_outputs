  "explanation": "The symbol mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count is required because it is the caller of the target function mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_. Analyzing the caller's usage of the target function helps determine if the target function is actually invoked at runtime. This is crucial to identify if any code in the target function is truly dead (never affecting program behavior) or just seldom executed but still reachable, complying with the MISRA C dead code rule. Since the target function has no callees, and dead code relates to executable code that could be removed without impact, understanding calling paths is essential to verify if the target function (and its operations) are live or dead code."
