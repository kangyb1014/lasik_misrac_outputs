  "explanation": "The original error message relates to missing external tools during the build process, not to compilation errors in the code itself. However, to ensure the provided C function compiles correctly, I included necessary headers such as <stdio.h>, <stdbool.h>, <limits.h>, and <sys/types.h> for ssize_t and related types. Also, I explicitly cast SSIZE_MAX to size_t when comparing and assigning to buffer_size to avoid compiler warnings or errors related to signed/unsigned comparison. These changes preserve the original logic while making the code self-contained and compilable."
