  "explanation": "The function uses memcmp to compare parts of the buffer with boundary strings and \"\\r\\n--\" sequences, so analyzing memcmp is essential to understand if these uses violate the MISRA C rule regarding memcmp usage with null-terminated strings. The structure MHD_PostProcessor and its members (like buffer_pos, buffer_size, state, skip_rn, etc.) are necessary to comprehend the buffer contents and flow control. PP_State enumeration values (next_state, next_dash_state, PP_Error) are required to understand state transitions which affect function behavior. RN_Dash is assigned to skip_rn and helps interpret the function logic. Macros or constants MHD_NO and MHD_YES represent return values, important for control flow analysis. The function pointer pp->ikvi is called with buf and newline values\u2014 understanding this call is key to knowing if memcmp is operating on null-terminated strings or not. Thus, all these symbols are needed to verify if memcmp is correctly used on non-null-terminated data, ensuring the MISRA C rule is not violated."
