  "explanation": "To analyze the target function for violations of the MISRA C rule against language extensions, the definition of 'struct MHD_PostProcessor' and 'enum PP_State' is necessary to check whether their declarations use any compiler-specific extensions. The symbols 'RN_Dash' and 'PP_Error' are needed to verify if their definitions or usage involve extensions. The macros or constants 'MHD_NO' and 'MHD_YES' must be checked to ensure they are standard and not relying on extensions. The function pointer 'pp->ikvi' and 'MHD_POSTDATA_KIND' are used as parameters and identifiers, so their declarations must be reviewed to rule out language extensions. This comprehensive set enables verification of all non-standard language features possibly used in the function."
