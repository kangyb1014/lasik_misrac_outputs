According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, a pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the referenced object is modified.

  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 states that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, but if a function modifies the object pointed to, the pointer should not be const-qualified. In the provided original code, the parameter upload_data is declared as const char *. It is passed unmodified to MHD_post_process. However, per the scenario, MHD_post_process expects a char * and modifies the data, which violates the rule because a pointer to const is used to reference an object that is modified. The test code attempts to cast away const to call MHD_post_process, which is an unsafe operation and supports that the declaration of upload_data as const char * is inappropriate if the data is to be modified. The compile failure in the test code is due to casting away const, which is undefined behavior in strict aliasing and const-related rules. Therefore, the original code indeed violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because it retains const qualification on a pointer referring to modifiable data, which contradicts the rule. Hence, the agent A's report that there is a violation is correct."
