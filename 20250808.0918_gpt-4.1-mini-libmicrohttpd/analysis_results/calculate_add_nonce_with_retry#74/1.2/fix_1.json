  "explanation": "The compilation error was caused by the use of incomplete types: the structs MHD_Connection and DigestAlgorithm were used as pointers but not defined anywhere, which made the code fail to compile. I added minimal dummy definitions for both structs to ensure the code compiles while preserving its logic. This does not affect the function logic since these structs were not dereferenced or used internally in the function. No other changes were made, so the original logic of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry is preserved exactly as in the provided code."
