  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified send_bad_request code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/499.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of send_bad_request as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of send_bad_request:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nsend_bad_request (struct MHD_Connection *con)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *res;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  res =\n    MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (strlen (BAD_REQUEST_PAGE),\n                                            (const void *) BAD_REQUEST_PAGE);\n  ret = MHD_queue_response (con, MHD_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, res);\n  MHD_destroy_response (res);\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function send_bad_request:\n_MHD_EXTERN struct MHD_Response *\nMHD_create_response_from_buffer_static (size_t size,\n                                        const void *buffer)\n{\n  return MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback_cls (size,\n                                                                 buffer,\n                                                                 NULL,\n                                                                 NULL);\n}\n...\n#define BAD_REQUEST_PAGE \"<html>\\n\"\"<head>\\n\"\"<title>WebSocket chat</title>\\n\"\"</head>\\n\"\"<body>\\n\"\"Bad Request\\n\"\"</body>\\n\"\"</html>\\n\"\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above send_bad_request code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "In the send_bad_request function, the pointer passed to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static is a const void* pointing to BAD_REQUEST_PAGE, which is a const-qualified string literal. Since the function and underlying functions do not modify the pointed data, this usage complies with Rule 8.13. No pointer is used in a context that attempts to modify a const-qualified object.",
