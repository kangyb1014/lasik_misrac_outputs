The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To analyze whether the for loops in SHA1ProcessMessageBlock are well-formed according to the MISRA C rule, the behavior of the loop bodies must be examined, including any side effects from function calls. The function SHA1CircularShift is called within the loop bodies, so its definition is needed to verify it does not modify any loop counters or other variables improperly, ensuring no persistent side effects violate clause 2 or 3 of the rule. Additionally, the structure SHA1Context is accessed in the loops via context->message_block and context->intermediate_hash; knowledge of this structure is required to confirm that the loops do not modify objects that would affect loop control variables or flags, and to understand the data flow and side effects within the loops. These two symbols are essential to fully assess loop well-formedness in compliance with the MISRA C requirements."
