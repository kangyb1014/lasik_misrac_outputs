  "explanation": "Only the listed fragments can lead to potential out-of-bounds accesses of the host_name buffer or affect its validity for use with string.h functions: the function signature (parameter types), the parameter-check macros, the call that delegates to the low-level implementation, and the direct write to host_name[0]. Everything else in the function (local variable declaration, comments, the if/return control flow structure, and the final return statement) does not perform any buffer access or call any <string.h> functions and therefore does not need investigation for Rule 21.17. The provided additional macro and constant definitions not listed above are likewise not relevant to string handling here."
