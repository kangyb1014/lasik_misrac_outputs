  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The code only checks that the pointers are non-NULL before calling strcmp, but does not ensure the pointed-to objects are valid null-terminated character arrays or within known bounds. If Rvc->TypeName (or WantTypeName) points to a char buffer that is not NUL-terminated (e.g. char buf[3] = {'a','b','c'} or a pointer into a larger buffer where the terminator lies beyond the object bounds), strcmp will continue reading past the object and access memory beyond its bounds, violating Rule 21.17."
