  "explanation": "Only the strcmp usage (and its guarding null-pointer check) touches string handling and therefore can potentially read beyond the referenced objects if the pointed buffers are not properly null-terminated or sized. No other lines in the function call any <string.h> functions (no memcpy/memset/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn/etc.), perform pointer arithmetic, or manipulate raw memory, so they do not fall under Rule 21.17 and need not be investigated for this specific rule. The genre comparisons and boolean logic are simple value checks and are not relevant to bounds accesses of string objects."
