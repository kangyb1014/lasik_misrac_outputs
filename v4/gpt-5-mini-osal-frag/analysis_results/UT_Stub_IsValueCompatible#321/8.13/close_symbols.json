  "explanation": "To check whether this function violates the MISRA guidance that pointers should point to const when possible you must know the exact declaration of the data being pointed to. The UT_RetvalConfigEntry_t definition is required to determine the declared type of Rvc->TypeName (e.g. char * vs const char *), and the declared type of the Genre member. UT_ValueGenre_t and the UT_ValueGenre_OPAQUE constant are needed to confirm the Genre comparison semantics and whether Genre is an object that should be const-qualified. The strcmp prototype is needed to confirm its parameter types (it takes const char *), which is relevant to whether passing Rvc->TypeName is const-correct and whether TypeName ought to be declared const. With these symbols one can decide if pointers in the struct should be declared with const to satisfy the MISRA rule."
