  "explanation": "1) UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t (type/definition, especially the Text member): The MISRA rule inspects whether pointers should be const-qualified. The key pointer returned by UtSprintf is Buf[TextIndex].Text \u2014 to decide if the function should return char * or const char * you must know how Text is declared (e.g. char Text[N]; const char Text[]; char *Text; etc.). If Text is mutable (char array or non-const char*), returning char * is appropriate; if Text is const-qualified then returning char * would violate const-correctness. Also the member type determines whether passing it to vsnprintf is valid (const->non-const mismatch).\n\n2) UT_SNPRINTF_MAX_BUFS (macro/value): This macro sizes the static Buf array. While its numeric value does not directly change const qualification, you must confirm Buf has at least one element and that indexing/wrap logic is meaningful. Knowing the macro also helps locate the definition of UT_Snprintf_Buffer_t in the same header/unit (the type and its members are often defined together) and ensures the buffer storage is truly static mutable storage rather than an alias to some const region.\n\n3) vsnprintf (prototype and parameter const-qualifiers): The function call writes into Buf[TextIndex].Text; the prototype (int vsnprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, va_list ap)) shows that the destination parameter is a non-const char * (i.e. vsnprintf modifies the buffer). To determine whether the pointer returned by UtSprintf should be const-qualified you must confirm that vsnprintf expects a mutable buffer; if vsnprintf's prototype in the build is different (or overridden) it could affect whether Text must be mutable or const. Knowing the exact signature also highlights any const/ non-const mismatches when passing Text to vsnprintf.\n\n(va_list/size_t and standard headers are assumed standard; the three symbols above are the additional items required to determine whether UtSprintf violates the MISRA pointer-const rule.)"
