  "explanation": "Other parts of the function do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer types (e.g. control flow, size_t ReturnSize, numeric casts), or already use const-qualified pointers where relevant (e.g. the parameter 'const char *TypeName'), or are string literals/format strings which are inherently constant. The listed fragments include all occurrences where non-const pointers are declared, returned, or used to access data that could reasonably be const-qualified and thus should be inspected further."
