  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe code calls strcmp(TypeName, StubPtr->Data.Buff.ContentTypeStr) with no checks that either pointer is non-NULL or that both point to valid NUL-terminated strings. Since ContentTypeStr is assigned directly from the caller in UT_Stub_RegisterReturnType (no copy or termination check), a malicious/erroneous caller could pass NULL, a non-NUL-terminated buffer, or a pointer to storage that has gone out of scope/been freed. In that case strcmp can read past the object bounds (or dereference NULL), violating Rule 21.17.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1733.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr:\n```c\nvoid *UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr(UT_EntryKey_t FuncKey, size_t ReturnSize, const char *TypeName)\n{\n    UT_StubTableEntry_t *StubPtr;\n    void *               ReturnPtr;\n\n    ReturnPtr = NULL;\n    StubPtr   = UT_GetStubEntry(FuncKey, UT_ENTRYTYPE_RETURN_BUFFER);\n\n    if (StubPtr == NULL)\n    {\n        /* This shouldn't happen, it means the stub tried to use a\n         * return buffer that does not exist.\n         *\n         * It is most likely caused by a mismatch/incompatibility between\n         * stub and handler.

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of UT_Stub_GetReturnValuePtr as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
