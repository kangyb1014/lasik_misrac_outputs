  "explanation": "Reason for each symbol being required to assess unreachable code in UtAssertEx:\n\n- UtAssert_CaseType_t\n  - Definition (enum/typedef) gives the set/range of possible CaseType values. If the type or its values make certain comparisons or assignments constant, branches can become statically unreachable.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_PASS\n  - Value assigned when Expression is true. Knowing its numeric value is needed to determine whether the subsequent comparison (uint32)CaseType < UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX can ever be true or is always/never true after assignment.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_MAX\n  - Compared against CaseType to decide whether CaseCount[...] is incremented. If this macro/value makes the comparison always true or always false for all possible CaseType values, the increment (and its body) could be unreachable.\n\n- UT_SegmentCounters\n  - The global struct/object whose fields are modified (TotalTestCases and CaseCount). Its declaration (and in particular whether these fields exist and CaseCount is a valid array) is needed to confirm the increment statements are actual reachable statements and not compiled-out or undefined.\n\n- UT_SegmentCounters.TotalTestCases\n  - Used and incremented before/after locking. If this field doesn\u2019t exist or has special semantics (e.g., implemented as a macro that expands to a noreturn expression), it could affect reachability.\n\n- UT_SegmentCounters.CaseCount\n  - The CaseCount array and its declared size are required to determine whether indexing by (uint32)CaseType might be constrained (making the increment unreachable) or if the array size is zero/absent (which could render the increment impossible/unreachable).\n\n- UT_TotalCounters\n  - Its TestSegmentCount field is read to form TestSegmentCount; the definition is needed to determine if that expression yields a compile-time constant that could alter control-flow reachability.\n\n- UT_TotalCounters.TestSegmentCount\n  - Same reasoning: if this value is constant (or its access has side effects/noreturn), it can influence whether later code paths are reachable.\n\n- CurrentSegment\n  - Passed to UtAssert_DoReport. If CurrentSegment is implemented such that its access never returns (unlikely) or is a macro that affects control flow, it could make parts of the function unreachable; at minimum, the symbol is needed to fully model the call to UtAssert_DoReport.\n\n- UT_BSP_Lock\n  - The call appears before most of the function body. If UT_BSP_Lock is specified or implemented as a non-returning function (noreturn) or as a macro that aborts/longjmps, everything after the call would be unreachable. Its prototype/attributes/implementation are therefore required.\n\n- UT_BSP_Unlock\n  - Similar to UT_BSP_Lock: if it does not return (or its implementation affects control flow in a way that makes following code unreachable), it changes reachability. Also useful to check whether lock/unlock pairs are conditional or expanded to constructs that affect flow.\n\n- OS_BSP_Lock_Impl and OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl\n  - These are callees of UT_BSP_Lock/Unlock (per the call graph). If the low-level OS implementations are noreturn (e.g., panic/abort) or perform longjmp/exit, that renders subsequent code unreachable; therefore their behavior/attributes must be known.\n\n- UtAssert_DoReport\n  - Called near the end of the function. If UtAssert_DoReport is defined as non-returning (e.g., it calls exit/longjmp or is annotated noreturn), then the final \"return Expression;\" becomes unreachable. The function\u2019s declaration/definition/attributes are therefore required.\n\nNotes/assumptions: Standard library calls used in the function (va_start/va_end/vsnprintf) and built-in typedefs (bool, uint32, va_list) are normally returning/ordinary; they need not be listed unless in this project they are redefined with nonstandard behavior. The listed symbols are the ones that can alter control flow deterministically from the source-level view and therefore are necessary to determine whether any statements in UtAssertEx are provably unreachable under the project\u2019s definitions."
