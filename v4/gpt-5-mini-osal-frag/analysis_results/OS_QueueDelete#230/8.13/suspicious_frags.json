  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could/should be const-qualified. In this snippet there are no pointer declarations or pointer arithmetic other than taking the address of the local token object; therefore the only locations that could involve non-const pointer targets are the three calls that pass &token (listed above). Other fragments in the function do not involve pointers (e.g. the function signature and return type, the local variable declarations 'OS_object_token_t token;' and 'int32 return_code;', the if-statement condition, simple assignments, and the final 'return return_code;') and thus are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and need not be investigated."
