  "explanation": "I report only the assignment \"sizeCopied = -1;\" as suspicious because it is executed unconditionally immediately prior to code that always assigns sizeCopied from a mq_receive/mq_timedreceive call before any use. Removing this initialization would not change program behaviour (the variable is overwritten before being read), so it appears to be dead/redundant code and should be investigated.\n\nOther fragments were NOT reported because they do not meet the definition of dead code (an executed operation whose removal would not affect program behaviour):\n- The parameter checks (OS_CHECK_POINTER(data), OS_CHECK_POINTER(size_copied), OS_CHECK_SIZE(size)) are runtime validation macros that can alter control flow on failure and therefore are not dead code. Their removal would change behaviour for invalid inputs.\n- The call to OS_ObjectIdGetById and subsequent use of the token and OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET are necessary for object lookup/locking; these operations affect program behaviour (access to the correct queue) and are not redundant.\n- The queue size check (if (size < queue->max_size) ...) and the assignment *size_copied = 0; plus the error return are functional and affect caller-visible behaviour, so not dead.\n- The mq_receive/mq_timedreceive loops and their EINTR handling are required for correct POSIX behaviour; the loop conditions (including the timeout==OS_CHECK checks) govern retry behavior and are not dead even if some sub-expressions are invariant during a particular loop iteration.\n- The memset(&ts, 0, sizeof(ts)); and OS_Posix_CompAbsDelayTime(timeout, &ts); calls initialize ts for the timed receive paths; removing them would change behaviour for the OS_CHECK and timed paths.\n\nIf desired, I can produce a more exhaustive list of potentially redundant or questionable expressions (e.g. loop-condition sub-expressions that are invariant within the loop) but those are not clearly dead code per the MISRA definition and were therefore not flagged above."
