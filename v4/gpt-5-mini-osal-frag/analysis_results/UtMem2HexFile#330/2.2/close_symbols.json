  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide if UtMem2HexFile is dead code:\n\n- callers of UtMem2HexFile (all translation-unit / link-time references): The primary criterion for dead code is whether the function is ever called. You must know every call site (including across TUs/at link time) to determine if removal changes program behaviour.\n\n- UtAssert_True: The function calls UtAssert_True in the error branch. UtAssert_True may be a no-op in some build configurations (e.g. stripped assertions) or may have side effects (logging, longjmp, abort). Its definition determines whether the error branch has observable effects; if it is a no-op the branch may be dead.\n\n- UtAssert_GetContext: Present in the static call graph and may be used by UtAssert_True. Its behaviour/side effects (or lack thereof) can influence whether the assertion call produces observable behaviour.\n\n- fopen: Controls whether the main (file-output) branch can execute. If fopen can never succeed in the target environment, the whole main branch might be dead. Also its semantics (side effects, errno) are relevant.\n\n- fprintf: Used extensively in the main branch to produce file output. You need to know whether fprintf produces observable effects (file I/O) and whether it might be compiled out or stubbed in embedded builds.\n\n- fclose: Completes the file I/O side effects. If fclose or the file I/O library is unavailable/stubbed, behaviour may differ.\n\n- printf: Used in the error branch to report opening errors. Its presence/behaviour affects whether the error branch has observable effects.\n\n- strerror: Used to format the error message for printf; its behaviour can affect whether the printf call is observable or meaningful.\n\n- errno: errno is used to supply the error reason to strerror/printf. Its linkage/semantics (macro, thread-local, etc.) affect the error reporting side effect.\n\n- isprint: Used in the printable-character output loop. Although usually side-effect-free, its implementation (macro/function) determines whether that loop has any hidden side effects that would prevent its removal.\n\n- FILE (std FILE type): The presence/absence or replacement of the FILE type and stdio implementation (or stubbing) in the build can make the entire file-output branch non-functional/removed; its definition affects whether file I/O code is reachable/meaningful.\n\n- uint32 and uint8 (typedefs): The exact typedefs/sizes influence loop bounds, indexing and cast behaviour. While sizes alone rarely make code dead, different typedefs or conditional typedefs across builds could change compilation or make code unreachable; include them to confirm the memory indexing and loop iterations used by the function.\n\nCollecting the definitions/implementations of these symbols (and a complete cross-TU call-site list for UtMem2HexFile) is necessary to determine whether any branch or the whole function has no observable effect and therefore qualifies as dead code under MISRA."
