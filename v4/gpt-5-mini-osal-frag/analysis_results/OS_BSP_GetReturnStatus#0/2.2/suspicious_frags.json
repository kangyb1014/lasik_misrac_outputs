The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains elements that are not candidates for dead-code investigation: the local declaration 'int retcode;' is used and returned, so it is live; the 'switch (OS_BSP_Global.AppStatus)' construct is the control flow selecting behavior and is not dead; the 'break' statements are required control-flow elements in the switch and are not redundant; the final 'return retcode;' is the observable output of the function. Comments are non-executable and therefore not relevant to dead-code analysis. The only operations that could potentially be unnecessary (i.e. executed but removable without changing observable behavior) are the per-case assignments in the switch, so those case blocks are reported for further investigation."
