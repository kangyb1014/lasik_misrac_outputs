  "explanation": "To determine whether any use of the <string.h> functions in UtAssert_StringBufCompare can access beyond the bounds of the referenced objects you must know: \n\n- UTASSERT_STRINGBUF_NULL_TERM: The function branches on this sentinel to decide between strlen() and memchr(..., StringMax). The concrete value/meaning (and whether callers set StringMax to this value to indicate \"use NUL-termination\") affects whether strlen() is used (which may read until a NUL anywhere) or memchr() with an explicit length is used.\n\n- memchr (prototype/semantics): memchr reads up to the provided length from the source pointer. To decide if memchr(...) can read out of bounds you must know its exact semantics and how the provided length (StringMax or FormatLen) relates to the actual allocated buffer size.\n\n- strlen (prototype/semantics): strlen scans until a NUL; if the buffer is not NUL-terminated within its allocated size this is an out-of-bounds read. Knowing that strlen is invoked when StringMax == UTASSERT_STRINGBUF_NULL_TERM is essential to detect that risk.\n\n- memcmp (prototype/semantics): memcmp reads the specified number of bytes from both source pointers. The code calls memcmp(String1,String2, min(FormatLen1,FormatLen2) ). To check safety you need to know that both source buffers are at least that long.\n\n- memcpy (prototype/semantics): memcpy copies FormatLen bytes into ScrubbedString1/2 and then writes a terminating NUL at index FormatLen. To ensure no overflow you must ensure FormatLen <= destination capacity-1 (to leave room for the terminating NUL) and that the source has at least FormatLen bytes.\n\n- UtAssertEx (prototype/behaviour): The function returns the result of UtAssertEx and passes the scrubbed strings into a printf-style format. You need to know whether UtAssertEx further inspects/copies the strings (or enforces additional constraints) and whether its use could expose an overflow or rely on the strings being properly NUL-terminated.\n\n- UTASSERT_CASETYPE_FAILURE: value not needed for bounds checking of string.h calls, but include to fully understand the call to UtAssertEx (side-effect analysis is sometimes relevant when reasoning about postconditions).\n\n- API contract for String1Max/String2Max (allowed range/meaning/units): Crucial. The safety of memchr(..., StringMax), memcmp(..., FormatLen), and memcpy(..., FormatLen) depends on what callers are allowed/expected to pass as StringMax: is it the actual allocated buffer size, the maximum considered length, a byte count including or excluding the NUL, or can callers pass arbitrary large values? The analyzer must know the preconditions (caller responsibilities) to decide whether this function itself can cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- Allocated object sizes for String1 and String2 at call sites (or caller preconditions): Even with the API contract, concrete information about the size of the objects referenced by String1/String2 at their call sites (or a guarantee that StringMax <= object size) is required to prove memchr/memcmp/memcpy do not read past the objects.\n\n- Maximum size of ScrubbedString1/ScrubbedString2 (256) \u2014 confirmation: The code uses fixed local arrays of length 256 and writes FormatLen bytes then a terminating NUL at index FormatLen. To decide if memcpy(...) or the subsequent ScrubbedString[FormatLen] = 0 write is safe you must confirm that the destination capacity is 256 and know the maximum possible value of FormatLen (derived from StringMax or actual string length). If FormatLen can be >=256 this is an out-of-bounds write.\n\nIn short: the standard function semantics (memchr/strlen/memcmp/memcpy) combined with the concrete meanings/limits of String1Max/String2Max (and the actual sizes of the source objects at call sites) and the fixed scrub buffer size are the required symbols/assumptions to prove or disprove any MISRA violation for out-of-bounds accesses."
