  "explanation": "I selected fragments that could hide dead operations or contradictory/conditional checks and therefore warrant investigation for Rule 2.2 (dead code). The remaining code was not selected because it clearly performs required runtime actions or the effect is evident and cannot be removed without changing behaviour: - The call and return of OS_ObjectIdGetByName (return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetByName(...); return return_code;) are the primary functional operations of the function and are not dead. - The high-level control flow of OS_SocketGetIdByName simply delegates to OS_ObjectIdFindByName and returns its code; there are no unreachable branches in the provided snippet. - The OS_printf branch that actually formats and writes the buffer (va_start/vsnprintf/OS_ConsoleWrite) is obviously functional I/O and not dead. - Simple variable declarations and the assignment of return_code have obvious runtime effects. - Comments and documented behaviour (other than the one flagged) do not themselves constitute executable dead code. The fragments flagged should be inspected because macros (ARGCHECK, LENGTHCHECK, OS_CHECK_POINTER, BUGCHECK_VOID, OS_DEBUG) may be conditional/no-op in some builds or duplicated by other checks, and the comment about allowing NULL conflicts with the argument checks; these conditions can produce executed operations whose removal might not change program behaviour (i.e. dead code) and so must be examined. Likewise, the writes and truncation/null-termination logic around vsnprintf include branches that may be unreachable or redundant depending on platform guarantees and macro definitions, so they were included for review."
