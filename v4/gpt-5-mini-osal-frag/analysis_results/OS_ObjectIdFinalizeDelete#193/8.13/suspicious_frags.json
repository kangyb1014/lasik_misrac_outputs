  "explanation": "Other lines in the function do not introduce or pass pointer types that could be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13. The remaining statements are control flow (if/else), scalar assignments to the local variable final_id, use of the OS_OBJECT_ID_UNDEFINED constant, the return statement, and the NULL literal \u2014 none declare or pass pointer-to-object types. All pointer uses in this function are covered by the listed fragments, so no additional fragments require review for possible const qualification."
