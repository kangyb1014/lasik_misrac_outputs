  "explanation": "I flagged the macro checks and the calls that propagate the 'name' pointer into the object lookup/search machinery because those are the only places in the provided code that plausibly involve standard string.h operations (e.g. strlen/strcpy/strncmp/strspn/etc.) in downstream code or macros whose definitions are not present here. The remaining fragments do not need investigation for Rule 21.17: simple pointer checks, assignments (e.g. *object_id = token.obj_id;), object token release wrappers, and the return statements do not perform string handling. The OS_printf usage in the snippet relies on vsnprintf (from <stdio.h>), and its local buffer is explicitly size-limited and null-terminated in the shown code; vsnprintf is outside the list of <string.h> functions covered by Rule 21.17. Therefore only the listed fragments that pass or validate the 'name' pointer into unspecified macros/functions warrant further inspection."
