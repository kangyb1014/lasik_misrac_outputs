  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because the pointer const-qualification is already applied where appropriate (function parameter 'const void *Memory' and 'const uint8 *Byte_ptr' are const-qualified), and the remaining pointers/objects are intentionally modifiable (OutputLine is a local buffer that is written to, and OutPtr is used to write into that buffer). The use of &Byte_ptr[i] is included above because it involves taking an address and converting it for printing; other expressions (loop indices, integer variables, and array declarations) do not involve pointer-to-object constness issues relevant to Rule 8.13."
