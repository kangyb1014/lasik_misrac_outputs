  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not need investigation for unreachable-code under Rule 2.1: the function header and the local declaration (void OS_BSP_Unlock_Impl(void) and int status;) are declarations and entry points and cannot be unreachable. The assignment status = pthread_mutex_unlock(...) is an actual call whose result determines control flow and is therefore reachable. The else branch that calls pthread_setcancelstate(...) is reachable for at least one outcome of the call above (i.e. when the function returns the value that causes the else path) and thus is not obviously unreachable. The closing braces and other syntactic parts are not executable statements and therefore not subject to the unreachable-code rule."
