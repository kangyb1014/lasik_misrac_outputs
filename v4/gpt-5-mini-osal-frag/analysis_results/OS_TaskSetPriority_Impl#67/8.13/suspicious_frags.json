  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointers that could point to const-qualified types. The function parameter 'token' is already a pointer to const and does not need investigation. Other local variables and expressions (e.g. os_priority, ret, calls to OS_PriorityRemap, pthread_setschedprio, OS_ObjectIdFromToken/OS_ObjectIdToInteger, and string handling) do not introduce pointers that could/should be const-qualified in this context. The four fragments reported are the sites where a pointer to an object table element is obtained or declared: the local pointer declaration, its assignment via the OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET macro, the macro definition that yields a non-const pointer, and the underlying table definition. These are the relevant places to check whether the pointer's type could be const-qualified; other lines either already use const correctly or do not involve pointer-to-object types relevant to this rule."
