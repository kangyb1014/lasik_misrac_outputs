  "explanation": "No direct calls to standard <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in the visible code. The remaining lines (variable declarations, OS_CHECK_POINTER(sem_id), the call to OS_BinSemCreate_Impl, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeNew, and the final return) do not themselves perform string handling and thus do not need investigation for Rule 21.17. The three reported fragments are macro or function invocations that take the sem_name string as an argument (or save the name) and therefore could internally invoke string.h routines or perform copies that might access beyond object bounds; they should be inspected. No other fragments in the provided code reference string pointer parameters or are likely to involve standard string handling."
