  "explanation": "Only fragments that involve passing the 'name' pointer into other code or potentially removing its const qualification need investigation for Rule 8.13. The function parameter itself is already const-qualified, and the remaining statements do not pass or create pointers to the pathname (they operate on the token or return_code). Specifically, calls that only take the address of 'token' or use non-pointer local variables (return_code, token) do not affect const qualification and therefore do not need investigation for this rule."
