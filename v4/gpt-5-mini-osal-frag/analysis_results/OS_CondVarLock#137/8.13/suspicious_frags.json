  "explanation": "Other fragments in this function do not need investigation for MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointers that might require const qualification. Specifically:\n- The function prototype and parameter declaration (int32 OS_CondVarLock(osal_id_t var_id)) use value types, not pointer types.\n- The local variable declarations (OS_object_token_t token; int32 return_code;) declare objects by value rather than pointers, so const qualification of pointer targets is not applicable at the declaration site.\n- The comment and the simple return statement (return return_code;) do not introduce pointer handling concerns.\nOnly the call sites that take the address of an object (the two lines listed above) involve pointer-to-object usage and therefore should be inspected to determine whether the pointed-to type should be const-qualified."
