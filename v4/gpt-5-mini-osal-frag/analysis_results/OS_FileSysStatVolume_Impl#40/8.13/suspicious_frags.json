  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter 'token' is already a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *), so it complies. The 'result' parameter is an output argument and must be a modifiable pointer (OS_statvfs_t *), so it should not be const. The local variable 'stat_buf' is used to receive data from statvfs and therefore must be modifiable. The subsequent assignments to result->block_size, result->blocks_free, and result->total_blocks are intentional writes to the output object and do not indicate missing const-qualification. The macro-based conversions and OSAL_*_C casts are not relevant to pointer constness. The three reported fragments are where a non-const pointer is obtained/used while only read here (declaration of local, obtaining it via the table macro potentially dropping const, and passing a non-const path to statvfs), so they should be investigated for possible const-qualification improvements."
