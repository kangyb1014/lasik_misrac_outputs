  "explanation": "Other fragments in the provided code do not appear to be dead code and therefore do not require investigation under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2. Specifically:\n- The retrieval and use of the implementation record (impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(...)) is an active data access required to obtain the thread id and is used by the subsequent pthread_detach call.\n- The call to pthread_detach(impl->id) is an executed operation that affects thread detach semantics; its removal would change runtime behaviour, so it is not dead code.\n- The condition and error-path return (if (ret != 0) { ... return OS_ERROR; }) and the final return OS_SUCCESS are active control flow and affect function outcome.\n- The small inline helpers and macros used to access token fields (OS_ObjectIdFromToken, OS_ObjectIndexFromToken, OS_ObjectIdToInteger, OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET) are simple accessors used by executing code; they are not redundant operations.\n- The OS_TaskExit function calls to obtain the token and to finalize deletion (OS_ObjectIdGetById, OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete) are meaningful runtime operations and cannot be removed without changing behaviour.\n- Variable declarations and straightforward assignments (e.g. int ret; impl = ...) are used and not mere no-op code.\n\nThe three fragments listed in suspicious_frags should be investigated because they can result in code being omitted or having no effect at runtime (e.g. an empty OS_DEBUG macro removes the logging call and its arguments from the compiled program, and the explicit call to OS_TaskExit_Impl is documented as never returning), which can mask dead code or create situations where operations are effectively no-ops. Other parts of the code are active and necessary for correct behaviour and thus were not included as suspicious."
