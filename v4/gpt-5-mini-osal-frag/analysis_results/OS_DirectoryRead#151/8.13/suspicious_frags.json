  "explanation": "The rule targets pointer types that could be declared to point to const when they are only used for reading. The selected fragments are places where data obtained from readdir is only read and therefore the pointer could be const-qualified.\nOther code fragments were NOT selected because they do not meet the \u2018\u2018point-to-const whenever possible\u2019\u2019 criterion: the function parameter os_dirent_t *dirent in OS_DirectoryRead and OS_DirRead_Impl is an output buffer that is written to (so it must be non-const); OS_object_token_t *token parameters passed to OS_ObjectIdGetById and OS_ObjectIdRelease are used for object lookup/state changes (they are written to or consumed), so they cannot be const-qualified; the OS_CHECK_POINTER(dirent) macro simply validates the (output) pointer; and other uses (OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(..., *token)) involve object tokens that are either already const-qualified in the callee or are intentionally mutable for bookkeeping. Therefore these other fragments are not suspected for Rule 8.13 issues."
