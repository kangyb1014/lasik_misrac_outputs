  "scenario": "The local pointer conn_impl is declared as a non-const pointer (OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *conn_impl) but in this function it is only read (conn_impl->fd is accessed) and never modified. According to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible, e.g. const OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *conn_impl. Therefore this fragment violates Rule 8.13."
