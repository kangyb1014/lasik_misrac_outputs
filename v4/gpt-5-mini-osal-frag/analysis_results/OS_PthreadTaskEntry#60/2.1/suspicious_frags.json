  "explanation": "The only potential unreachable-code issues in the provided snippets are centered on the pthread entry and the task-exit path: OS_PthreadTaskEntry contains a trailing \"return NULL;\" after a call annotated \"/* Never returns */\", and the task-exit path calls OS_TaskExit_Impl() which is commented as never returning. These fragments (provided above) should be investigated to confirm whether the call-chain indeed does not return and thus whether the return statement (or any code after a non-returning call) is truly unreachable. Other parts of the code do not indicate unreachable code: the union definition and the assignment local_arg.opaque_arg = arg are legitimate (the union is intentionally accessed via a different member as noted by the cppcheck suppression), the conditional logic inside OS_TaskEntryPoint invokes OS_TaskExit() in all control paths (so there is no hidden unreachable branch inside that function), and there are no other statements shown after non-returning calls that would be reachability concerns. Therefore no other fragments need investigation based on the provided code."
