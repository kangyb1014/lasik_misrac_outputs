  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they do not introduce pointer-to-object types that could reasonably be const-qualified: simple scalar declarations (return_code), token handling (OS_object_token_t token and uses of &token), control-flow checks on return_code, calls that do not involve pointer-to-data types (OS_TaskExit(), OS_NotifyEvent(), OS_ObjectIdRelease(), OS_TaskRegister_Impl(), OS_TaskMatch_Impl(), OS_ObjectIdGetById()), and other non-pointer expressions are outside the scope of the rule. The selected fragments cover all occurrences where pointers or pointer-to-function types are declared, assigned, passed by address, or dereferenced in these excerpts and therefore are the relevant locations to check whether the pointed-to types could/should be const-qualified."
