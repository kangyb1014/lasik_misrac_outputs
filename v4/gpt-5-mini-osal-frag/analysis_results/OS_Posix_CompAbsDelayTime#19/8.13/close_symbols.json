  "explanation": "- struct timespec: Needed to know the exact member types (tv_sec, tv_nsec) and whether the members are modifiable. Determining whether the pointer parameter could be declared const requires knowing whether the function writes into the pointed object (it does: tm->tv_sec, tm->tv_nsec). The struct definition confirms those are ordinary writable members (not already const/volatile or opaque). \n- clock_gettime prototype: clock_gettime is called with tm; its prototype shows whether it accepts a struct timespec * (non-const) and therefore whether this function must supply a writable buffer. If clock_gettime takes a non-const pointer and writes into *tm, tm cannot be const-qualified. \n- CLOCK_REALTIME: The clockid argument type (macro/enum) and use do not change constness of tm, but including this symbol lets the analyzer confirm the correct overload/signature of clock_gettime is used. \n- time_t typedef: The code casts (msecs / 1000) to time_t and assigns to tm->tv_sec. Knowing time_t's definition (signedness/width) is useful to confirm the assignment is to a mutable member and to ensure the member type matches the struct definition when considering const qualification. \n- Prototypes of callers (OS_BinSemTimedWait_Impl, OS_CountSemTimedWait_Impl, OS_QueueGet_Impl): To determine whether making the parameter const would be compatible with call sites, the analyzer should see how callers obtain and pass the timespec object (e.g., address of a local non-const struct vs address of a const object). If callers rely on the function to modify the timespec, tm must remain non-const."
