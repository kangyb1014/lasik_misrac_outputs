  "scenario": "The call to OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl(&token) is executed in OS_unmount but the implementation of OS_FileSysUnmountVolume_Impl is a pure no-op that unconditionally returns OS_SUCCESS. Since the call has no side\u2011effects and its removal (or replacing it by setting return_code = OS_SUCCESS) would not change program behaviour, this constitutes dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (Note: if the call is intentionally retained for portability or to preserve timing semantics, that rationale must be documented; otherwise the code violates the rule.)"
