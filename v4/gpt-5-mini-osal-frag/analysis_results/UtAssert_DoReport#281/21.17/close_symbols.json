  "explanation": "strlen: The target uses strlen(File) to compute FileLen. To determine whether this call can read beyond the bounds of the object referenced by File you must know the exact contract/semantics of strlen (it scans until a '\\0') and, critically, whether the object pointed to by File is guaranteed to be a valid NUL-terminated array. The analysis must confirm that the call-site guarantees (non-NULL, NUL-terminated, sufficiently sized) hold.\\nsnprintf: The function uses snprintf(..., \"%s\", BasePtr, ...) which reads the string at BasePtr (a pointer into File). Although snprintf is in <stdio.h> (not <string.h>), its %s conversion reads characters until a NUL terminator; therefore safety of that read is tied to the same NUL-termination guarantee for File/BasePtr. Inspecting snprintf's behavior (it will not write past ReportBuffer because size is supplied) helps distinguish read vs write concerns, but the read-side still must be proven safe.\\nUtAssertEx: This is the only caller shown in the static graph that supplies the File argument to UtAssert_DoReport. To determine whether strlen(File) (and the subsequent backward scan and the snprintf %s read of BasePtr) are safe, the caller(s) must be examined to see what they pass as File (e.g., __FILE__, a literal, a buffer that is guaranteed NUL-terminated, or a potentially NULL/unterminated pointer). The full definition/implementation (and any wrappers/macros that call it) of UtAssertEx is required to establish the preconditions on the File parameter.\\nNote: The above three symbols are the minimal set required to decide whether the use of the string-handling read operations in UtAssert_DoReport can access beyond object bounds. If UtAssertEx in turn gets File from other functions or macros, those must also be inspected (e.g., callers of UtAssertEx or macros expanding to pass __FILE__) to complete the proof."
