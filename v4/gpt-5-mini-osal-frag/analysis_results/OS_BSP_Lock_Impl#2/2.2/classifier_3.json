The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_BSP_Lock_Impl:\n```c\nvoid OS_BSP_Lock_Impl(void)\n{\n    int status;\n\n    status = pthread_mutex_lock(&OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessMutex);\n    if (status < 0)\n    {\n        BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_lock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        /*\n         * Temporarily Disable/Defer thread cancellation.\n         * Note that OS_BSP_ConsoleOutput_Impl() calls write() which is a cancellation point.\n         * So if this calling task is canceled, it risks leaving the BSP locked.\n         */\n        pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal.AccessCancelState);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_BSP_Lock_Impl:\n#define BSP_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nOS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobalData_t OS_BSP_GenericLinuxGlobal\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nif (status < 0)\n{\n    BSP_DEBUG(\"pthread_mutex_lock: %s\\n\", strerror(status));\n}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "BSP_DEBUG is defined as an empty macro, so when status < 0 the if body performs no observable action. The conditional and its empty body are executed but removing them would not change program behaviour (aside from micro-timing), so this is dead code and violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Example: the branch compiles to no side-effects because the debug macro expands to nothing."
