  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2 is: Functions shall not call themselves, either directly or indirectly.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 17.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nOS_printf calls OS_DEBUG when OS_SharedGlobalVars.GlobalState is not initialized. If OS_DEBUG is implemented (or macro-expanded) to call OS_printf (a common logging implementation), this yields indirect recursion: OS_printf -> OS_DEBUG -> OS_printf, which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified OS_rmfs code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/2300.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_rmfs:\n```c\nint32 OS_rmfs(const char *devname)\n{\n    int32             return_code;\n    OS_object_token_t token;\n\n    /* Check parameters */\n    OS_CHECK_PATHNAME(devname);\n\n    return_code = OS_ObjectIdGetByName(OS_LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, LOCAL_OBJID_TYPE, devname, &token);\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /*\n         * NOTE: It is likely that if the file system is mounted,\n         * this call to stop the volume will fail.\n         *\n         * It would be prudent to first check the flags to ensure that\n         * the filesystem is unmounted first, but this would break\n         * compatibility with the existing unit tests.\n         */\n        return_code = OS_FileSysStopVolume_Impl(&token);\n\n        /* Free the entry in the master table  */\n        return_code = OS_ObjectIdFinalizeDelete(return_code, &token);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n\n<instruction>\n\nPlease provide the modified OS_rmfs code.\n\nThe information below explains how I\u2019ll use the function you provide. Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original OS_rmfs with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as OS_rmfs.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call OS_rmfs to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of OS_rmfs as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, OS_rmfs will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_rmfs as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
