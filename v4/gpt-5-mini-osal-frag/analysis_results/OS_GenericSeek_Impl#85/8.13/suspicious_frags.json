  "explanation": "The function parameter 'const OS_object_token_t *token' is already const-qualified and does not need further investigation. The inline helper OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already accepts a pointer to const, so it is const-correct. Use of lseek and the handling of its return value do not introduce pointer types that could be const-qualified within this function. The call to strerror() is a library function returning a char *; there is no pointer declaration in this code that could be made const for that result. The local scalar variables (where, os_result, retval) are not pointer types and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13. The listed fragments are the locations where a pointer to the file-table element is obtained/declared (the macro, its invocation, the local pointer variable, and the external table declaration) and therefore should be investigated for possible const-qualification (e.g., using a pointer to const for impl or adjusting the macro/extern to preserve const-correctness)."
