  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the provided snippets do not appear to be dead code and therefore do not require investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2: - The OS_FileSys_Initialize function contains parameter checks, object allocation/initialization, volume type determination, calls to start/format the volume, flag setting, and finalization. These operations produce observable side effects (state changes, possible I/O or formatting) so their removal would change program behaviour. - The calls to OS_FileSysStartVolume_Impl and OS_FileSysFormatVolume_Impl (and the surrounding logic) are actual operations that affect system state and are not no-ops. - The mkfs/initfs wrapper functions perform error-code translation for backward compatibility; returning different error codes would change observable behaviour. - The macros (OS_CHECK_STRING, OS_CHECK_PATHNAME, OS_OBJECT_INIT, etc.), the typedef and the OS_SUCCESS define are not executable operations that would be classified as dead code in this context. - Comments and parameter validations are either non-executable or clearly affect control flow/validation and are therefore not candidates for dead code. The only fragments that warrant inspection for possible dead code are the no-op implementation and its call sites listed above."
