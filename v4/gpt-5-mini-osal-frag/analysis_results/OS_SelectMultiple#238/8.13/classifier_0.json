  "scenario": "OS_SelectMultiple takes parameters as non-const (OS_FdSet *ReadSet, OS_FdSet *WriteSet) and forwards them unchanged to OS_SelectMultiple_Impl. If neither OS_SelectMultiple nor OS_SelectMultiple_Impl modify the fd sets (i.e. they only read them), then the pointers should be declared const (const OS_FdSet *). In that case the current code (passing non-const pointers and using non-const parameter types) violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If the implementations do modify the sets, then non-const is required and there is no violation.)"
