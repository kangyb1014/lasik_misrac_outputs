  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were not considered suspicious for Rule 8.13: the function parameter is already a pointer to const (const OS_object_token_t *token), so it complies; OS_ObjectIndexFromToken already takes a const OS_object_token_t *; the local 'status' variable and the return statements do not involve pointers to object data and are irrelevant to pointer-to-const qualification; the call to pthread_mutex_destroy requires a mutable pthread_mutex_t* by API contract, so the pointer passed there cannot be const-qualified. Therefore those parts need no further investigation for this rule."
