  "explanation": "The rule concerns pointers and const-qualification. In this function the only pointer expressions are the three occurrences of &token passed to other routines; these are the only places that could involve pointers that might need const qualification and therefore require investigation. Other fragments (local scalar declarations, the return statement, and the function parameter passed by value) do not involve pointer types that could be const-qualified and so do not need to be inspected for Rule 8.13 compliance."
