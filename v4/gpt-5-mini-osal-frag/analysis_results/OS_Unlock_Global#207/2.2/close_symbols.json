  "explanation": "For a correct dead\u2011code (MISRA) analysis of OS_Unlock_Global the next agent must know the precise semantics and side effects of the operations in the function body and whether they can be removed without changing program behaviour.\n\n- OS_Unlock_Global_Impl: the function is invoked at the end of the body. You must know its implementation and side effects to determine if calling it is necessary (removing it might change behaviour).\n- OS_objtype_state: the global array whose element is read/written (objtype = &OS_objtype_state[token->obj_type]; objtype->owner_key = ...). You must know other code that observes this array to see if the assignments are effective or redundant.\n- OS_objtype_state_t: the type definition (structure) is required to know the presence, types and sizes of members (owner_key, etc.) and whether assignments have side effects (e.g., volatile members, padding, or custom assignment operators in embedded contexts).\n- OS_object_token_t: the token type is needed to know obj_type and lock_mode field types and ranges and whether modifications to token->lock_key affect observable state elsewhere.\n- owner_key.key_value: the exact type/representation of this subfield is required because the code performs bitwise tests and equality comparisons; its semantics determine whether the test can ever be true/false and whether assigning OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID changes observable behaviour.\n- lock_key.key_value: same reason as owner_key.key_value for the token->lock_key comparisons/assignments.\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_FIXED_VALUE: the constant/macro value used in the mask test. Its definition is needed to determine whether the conditional that triggers the debug message can ever occur; that affects whether the debug path is live or effectively dead.\n- OS_LOCK_KEY_INVALID: the value assigned to owner_key and token->lock_key. Need to know if it is identical to a previous default or has side effects (e.g., special values) to judge whether the assignments are redundant.\n- OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER: the constant used in the obj_type range test (token->obj_type < OS_OBJECT_TYPE_USER). Its value (and valid obj_type ranges) is needed to determine how often the body can execute (influence on being dead or not).\n- OS_LOCK_MODE_NONE: the constant compared to token->lock_mode. Required to determine how often the body executes and whether the test is redundant.\n- OS_DEBUG: the debug macro/function invoked when mismatches occur. Many projects make debug macros compile to no\u2011ops in production; you must know whether OS_DEBUG produces side effects (I/O, logging) or is compiled out \u2014 that determines if the debug calls are dead code.\n\nProviding these symbols (definitions and values) allows the next agent to decide whether the executed operations in OS_Unlock_Global have observable effects elsewhere (and therefore are not dead), or whether they are effectively no\u2011ops and could be removed without changing program behaviour."
