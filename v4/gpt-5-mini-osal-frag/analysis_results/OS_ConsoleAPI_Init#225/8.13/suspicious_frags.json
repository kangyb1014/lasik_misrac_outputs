  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointer-to-object types that could reasonably be made to point to const-qualified types. Specifically: local scalar declarations (e.g. return_code, token) are non-pointer values; simple boolean assignment (OS_SharedGlobalVars.PrintfEnabled = true) and comments are irrelevant; and usages that clearly mutate the target object (e.g. initializing or writing structure fields via the console record) require a non-const pointer by design and therefore are not candidates for converting the pointer target type to const. The selected fragments include all places in this function where pointers or addresses are taken, returned from macros, or assigned from potentially const-qualified storage and thus merit review to determine whether the pointed-to types should be const-qualified per Rule 8.13."
