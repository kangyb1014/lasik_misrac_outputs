  "explanation": "Only the code fragments that invoke Standard Library string handling functions need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. In this function the only use of a <string.h> function is the strcmp call inside the shown if statement \u2014 therefore it is reported. Other lines and constructs are not relevant to this rule: OS_CHECK_POINTER(Filename) is a pointer-validation macro (not a string library call); the iterator setup, OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext, OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy, and OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET calls manipulate object/iterator state and do not call string.h functions; the remaining variable declarations, assignments, and return statements do not involve string handling. No other <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, etc.) appear in this code fragment, so they do not need investigation here."
