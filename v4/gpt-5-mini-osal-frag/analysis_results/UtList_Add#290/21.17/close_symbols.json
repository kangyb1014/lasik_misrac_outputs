  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required (concise):\n\n- UtList_NewNode: This function receives Data and DataSize and most likely allocates a node and copies the supplied Data into the node. To determine whether any string.h calls (memcpy/strcpy/\u2026 ) are used and whether the copy lengths are correct (no buffer overrun), the implementation of UtList_NewNode must be inspected.\n\n- UtList_GetHead: Although UtList_GetHead is only used to select a tag head, its implementation must be reviewed to ensure it does not itself call any string/memory functions that could violate bounds (or return a pointer into a buffer that is later misused).\n\n- UtList_Insert_Before: This function manipulates list nodes. Its implementation must be checked for any use of string.h functions or pointer arithmetic that could access node payloads beyond their bounds.\n\n- UtListNode_t (struct definition): The node layout (fields, sizes, and whether the node contains an inline data buffer or a pointer to allocated data) is essential to know the destination buffer size for any copy. Without the struct definition you cannot determine whether DataSize might exceed the destination capacity.\n\n- UtListHead_t (struct definition): Knowing the head structure can reveal whether GetHead/Insert_Before return or manipulate pointers into shared buffers or fixed-size arrays that could be overrun.\n\n- UtList_NewNode's callees / helper functions (malloc/calloc/realloc/free and any project allocation wrappers): The allocation size and semantics determine how much space is available for a copied Data buffer. Any wrapper functions must be inspected to ensure they allocate the expected number of bytes.\n\n- Any project string/memory helper wrappers (e.g., UT_BSP_MemCpy, UT_BSP_Strcpy): Projects sometimes wrap standard functions. These wrappers must be analyzed in place of (or in addition to) the standard library names to find actual copies/sets.\n\n- Standard string/memory functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn): The MISRA rule targets these functions. If any of these are called (directly or via wrappers) in UtList_NewNode, UtList_GetHead, UtList_Insert_Before, or their callees, their argument values (pointer and length) must be validated against object bounds. Include these symbols so the next agent can find their uses and check bounds.\n\n- typedef/definition of uint32 (and size_t if project defines it differently): To check whether DataSize is in the expected units and whether any conversions could cause incorrect sizes when passed to memcpy/other functions, you need the exact typedefs and any implicit conversions.\n\nIn short: provide the implementations (or at least prototypes and called helpers) of UtList_NewNode, UtList_GetHead, UtList_Insert_Before; the struct definitions for nodes/heads; the allocation helpers used; and any occurrences of the listed string.h functions or their project wrappers. These symbols are necessary to determine whether any string/memory call uses a pointer/length that can access beyond the referenced object bounds."
