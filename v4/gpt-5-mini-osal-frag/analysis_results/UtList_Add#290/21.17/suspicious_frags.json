  "explanation": "Only calls to the standard string/memory functions and the allocation that feeds them are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The listed fragments must be investigated because they involve malloc/memset/memcpy and the pointer/size parameters that could lead to out-of-bounds accesses or use of null pointers (e.g. malloc failure, Data==NULL with non-zero DataSize, or mismatched sizes). Other code fragments do not need investigation for this rule: - UtList_Insert_Before only performs pointer linkage operations and does not call any <string.h> functions. - UtList_GetHead performs a bounds check on Tag and returns a tag head or NULL; it does not use string functions. - UtList_Add checks TagHead != NULL before calling UtList_NewNode and only handles list insertion; the risk relevant to Rule 21.17 is localized to UtList_NewNode and its use of memset/memcpy. - Pointer assignments such as setting Next/Prev in UtList_NewNode and UtList_Insert_Before are not string.h usage and do not fall under Rule 21.17. Therefore further investigation should focus on the listed fragments."
