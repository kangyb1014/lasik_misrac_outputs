  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they are clearly used as mutable outputs or are being written to: the parameter 'OS_socket_prop_t *sock_prop' is an output buffer initialized with memset() and populated by the function (so it must be non-const); the call to OS_ObjectIdGetById(..., &token) supplies an uninitialized token that the callee fills (so the token pointer cannot be const); the call to OS_ObjectIdRelease(&token) is a release operation that is expected to modify or consume the token (so it must accept a non-const pointer). The macro OS_CHECK_POINTER merely validates non-null and does not change pointer qualification needs. The global table symbol is declared as a const pointer-to-table in the provided definitions; accesses to it via the macro are covered by the flagged macro usage above. Therefore no other fragments in the function appear to violate the guideline and do not require further investigation."
