  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - 'impl' is used to modify impl->dl_handle (impl->dl_handle = dlopen(...)), so the pointer must refer to a non-const object. - Function parameters are already const-qualified where appropriate: 'const OS_object_token_t *token' and 'const char *translated_path'. - The calls to dlopen() and dlerror() use external library APIs whose signatures dictate the pointer constness (dlopen takes const char *; dlerror returns char *), so those cannot / should not be changed here. - Non-pointer objects (dl_mode, status) are not relevant to this rule. Therefore only the module-related fragments (declaration, assignment, and read-only access) are candidates to check whether the pointer could be const-qualified."
