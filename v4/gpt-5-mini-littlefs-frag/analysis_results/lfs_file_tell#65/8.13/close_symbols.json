  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for MISRA C 'pointer should be const whenever possible' analysis:\n\n- lfs_file_t (type definition): You must know the exact type of the 'file' parameter (is it a typedef to a struct, is it already const-qualified anywhere, or does it alias another type). Whether 'file' can be declared const depends on whether its members are modified or whether its type is convertible to other APIs that require non-const. The concrete type definition shows what operations on it would modify state.\n\n- struct lfs_mlist (type/definition): The code casts 'file' to '(struct lfs_mlist*)'. To determine if that cast discards/needs const (and thus if declaring file const would be legal), you need the definition and relation between lfs_file_t and struct lfs_mlist (are they the same object layout, is one a subtype). This reveals whether a const qualification on lfs_file_t would conflict with uses as struct lfs_mlist*.\n\n- lfs_mlist_isopen (prototype): The function is called with (lfs->mlist, (struct lfs_mlist*)file). Its parameter types (e.g., takes struct lfs_mlist * vs const struct lfs_mlist *) determine whether a const lfs_file_t * could be passed without casting away const. If the callee requires non-const, the target function cannot make its parameter const without changing callers or performing a cast (which MISRA flags).\n\n- lfs_file_tell_ (prototype): The function returns the actual position and is invoked with the same 'lfs' and 'file' parameters. Its prototype (whether it accepts lfs_file_t * or const lfs_file_t *) determines whether lfs_file_tell is forced to take a non-const pointer because it must pass it to lfs_file_tell_.\n\n- lfs_t (type/definition): The type of the first parameter and the types of its members (notably 'mlist' and 'cfg') are needed to see whether taking lfs_t * could be const, and to understand the types of lfs->mlist used when calling lfs_mlist_isopen. If lfs->mlist has an incompatible qualifier, that affects whether file could be const or whether casts are required.\n\n- LFS_LOCK / LFS_UNLOCK (macro or function definitions): These are called with 'lfs->cfg'. While they do not directly use 'file', their signatures/macros could require lfs to be non-const or perform casts that affect whether the function may accept a const lfs_t *. Knowing their definitions ensures you can decide whether the lfs parameter could be const-qualified in this function.\n\n(Other macros used here, such as LFS_TRACE and LFS_ASSERT, only use void* casts for logging/assertion and generally do not affect const qualification of parameters; they can be ignored unless their definitions take or cast pointers in a way that affects const correctness.)"
