  MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.
  
  </misra_rule>
  
  Another agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.
  Here is the comment from the agent.
  <violation scenario>
  The call passes a non-const pointer (lfs_dir_t *dir) to lfs_dir_close_. If neither lfs_dir_close nor lfs_dir_close_ modify the object pointed to by dir (i.e. they only read it), then the pointer should be const-qualified (const lfs_dir_t *dir). In that case the current use of a non-const pointer violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.
  </violation scenario>
  
  Your job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.
  Insert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.
  <response format>
  - test_code: a modified lfs_dir_close code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/25.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.
  </response format>
  <target_code>
  Here is the code of lfs_dir_close:
  ```c
  int lfs_dir_close(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {
      int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);
      if (err) {
          return err;
      }
      LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);
  
      err = lfs_dir_close_(lfs, dir);
  
      LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close -> %d\", err);
      LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);
      return err;
  }
  ```
  </target_code>
  
  <instruction>
  
  Please provide the modified lfs_dir_close code.
  
  The information below explains how I\u2019ll use the function you provide. Please use it as a reference when generating code.
  1. Replacement
    - I will parse your function and replace the original lfs_dir_close with it.
    - Your function must have the exact same signature as lfs_dir_close.
    - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)
  2. Logging / reachability
    - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call lfs_dir_close to check logs.
    - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_dir_close as much as possible.
    - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, lfs_dir_close will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.
  3. Coverage
    - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.
    - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.
    - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.
  4. Test code constraints
    - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of lfs_dir_close as much as possible.
    - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.
    - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.
    - The test code MUST include line breaks.
    - You MUST NOT define the main function.
    - You MUST NOT define macros.
    - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.
    - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.
  
  These are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:
  - Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.
  - Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.
  - Invoking undeclared function.
  - Using undeclared member in a struct.
  - Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.
