  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of lfs_dir_close:\n```c\nint lfs_dir_close(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    int err = LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    if (err) {\n        return err;\n    }\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close(%p, %p)\", (void*)lfs, (void*)dir);\n\n    err = lfs_dir_close_(lfs, dir);\n\n    LFS_TRACE(\"lfs_dir_close -> %d\", err);\n    LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg);\n    return err;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function lfs_dir_close:\n#define LFS_LOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg,0)\n...\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n...\n#define LFS_TRACE(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\nstatic int lfs_dir_close_(lfs_t *lfs, lfs_dir_t *dir) {\n    // remove from list of mdirs\n    lfs_mlist_remove(lfs, (struct lfs_mlist *)dir);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n...\nstatic void lfs_mlist_remove(lfs_t *lfs, struct lfs_mlist *mlist) {\n    for (struct lfs_mlist **p = &lfs->mlist; *p; p = &(*p)->next) {\n        if (*p == mlist) {\n            *p = (*p)->next;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n#define LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) ((void)cfg)\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The macro LFS_UNLOCK(cfg) expands to ((void)cfg). In lfs_dir_close this evaluates lfs->cfg and discards the result, with no side effects. Removing the LFS_UNLOCK(lfs->cfg) call would not change program behaviour, therefore the operation is dead code (violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2)."
