  "explanation": "I flagged all pointer declarations and uses in the provided snippets that could plausibly be const-qualified and therefore merit investigation. I did not flag members that are already const-qualified (for example: \"const struct lfs_config *cfg\" in lfs_t and \"const struct lfs_file_config *cfg\" in lfs_file_t) because they already satisfy the rule. Non-pointer fields (arrays, integer types, typedefs that are not pointers) were not considered relevant to Rule 8.13 and thus were not included."
