  "explanation": "To decide whether the pointer parameters in lfs_file_size_ (lfs_t *lfs, lfs_file_t *file) can/should be const-qualified under MISRA's \"pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\", the analyser needs the following symbols:\n\n- typedef lfs_soff_t: confirms the returned scalar type and that no pointer semantics in the return type force non-const qualification of the parameters.\n\n- typedef struct lfs lfs_t: the full type of the first parameter. Although (void)lfs; currently marks it unused in this function, the definition is needed to check whether any implicit or indirect mutation could occur (e.g. via macros or inline functions) or whether callers expect a non-const lfs_t*.\n\n- typedef struct lfs_file lfs_file_t: the full file structure is required to determine whether lfs_file_size_ reads only immutable members or whether any accessed members are modifiable/require non-const access.\n\n- definition of lfs_file_t members: flags, pos, ctz (and the type of ctz.size): the function reads file->flags, file->pos and file->ctz.size. To know if these accesses are read-only (permitting a const-qualified pointer) or if any of these members are declared with special qualifiers (e.g. volatile) or are accessed through side-effecting expressions/macros, the exact member types and qualifiers must be known.\n\n- prototype of lfs_max: to verify that the call lfs_max(file->pos, file->ctz.size) does not accept pointers or require non-const arguments that would prevent making the file parameter const. If lfs_max had side effects or took a pointer to file, that would matter.\n\n- macro or build symbol LFS_READONLY: the conditional #ifndef LFS_READONLY controls whether the branch that inspects file->flags is compiled. Whether the branch is present affects whether the function needs mutable access; the analyser must know the build configuration or macro definition to decide if the pointer can be const.\n\n- macro or enum LFS_F_WRITING: needed to understand the semantics of the flags test (file->flags & LFS_F_WRITING) and whether evaluating that expression could require non-const access or be implemented by macros that modify state.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyser determine if lfs_file_size_ performs only read accesses (so parameters could be const) or if there are any reasons (member qualifiers, called functions, build-time conditionals) that require non-const pointers."
