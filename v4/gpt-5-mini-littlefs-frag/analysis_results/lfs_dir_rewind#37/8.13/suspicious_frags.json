  "explanation": "Only expressions that involve pointer types are relevant to Rule 8.13. The listed fragments cover all uses of pointer-typed objects in this function: the function parameters, the call that forwards those pointers to a helper, the lock/unlock macro invocations that access lfs->cfg, and the trace call that casts the pointers. Other lines (local int err, checks of err, the trace that prints an int, the return statement, and surrounding braces) do not involve pointer types and therefore do not need to be investigated for pointer const-qualification under this rule."
