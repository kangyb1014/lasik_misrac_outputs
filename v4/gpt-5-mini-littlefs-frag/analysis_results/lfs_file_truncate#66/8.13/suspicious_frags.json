  "explanation": "Only fragments that involve pointer types, pointer parameters, or casts that may remove const qualification have been selected for investigation against MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Other parts of the function do not introduce pointer targets that could be made const (for example: the local integer 'err', the scalar parameter 'size', the trace format strings, the final trace call that only prints an integer, and the function return). Therefore those non-pointer or non-casting fragments do not need further inspection for this rule."
