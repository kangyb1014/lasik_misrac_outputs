  "explanation": "- lfs_getattr_: the direct callee that implements the real work. Any use of memcmp to compare path strings will be inside this function.\\n- lfs_dir_find: likely compares directory entry names against the supplied path; must be inspected for memcmp used on null-terminated strings.\\n- lfs_tag_id: part of the callee set; may be used in parsing directory tags and could perform comparisons\u2014include to be sure no memcmp-on-string occurs.\\n- lfs_dir_fetch: fetches directory data and may compare name buffers; inspect for memcmp use.\\n- lfs_dir_get: retrieves directory entries and may perform name comparisons (potential memcmp sites).\\n- lfs_min: a utility in the call graph; include to confirm it does not hide any string-comparison logic (rare but inexpensive to check).\\n- lfs_tag_size: included by the callee chain; include to ensure no string comparisons using memcmp occur there.\\n- memcmp: the Standard Library function of interest \u2014 needed to determine whether it is called and whether it is being used on null-terminated strings (the MISRA violation).\\n- strcmp, strncmp: standard string comparison functions \u2014 include to detect alternative correct/incorrect comparisons and to help decide whether memcmp is being misused to compare C-strings (e.g., where strcmp/strncmp would be appropriate).\\n\nInspecting the source of lfs_getattr_ and each listed callee plus occurrences of memcmp/strcmp/strncmp is sufficient to determine whether memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings in the target function's execution path."
