  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: The controlling expression of interest is if (err) where err is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). To determine whether that controlling expression can be invariant we must see the actual definition/implementation/expansion of LFS_LOCK (macro or function) and its return behavior.\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Although not part of a controlling expression here, the paired unlock macro/function may share the same configuration-dependent implementation as LFS_LOCK (e.g. both expand to no-ops or real locking calls). Its definition helps determine whether LFS_LOCK is conditionally a no-op/invariant.\n- lfs_t (structure definition): The expansion of LFS_LOCK takes lfs->cfg as argument. We must inspect the lfs_t definition to confirm the type and semantics of the cfg field and whether passing that field could produce variable behavior.\n- type of lfs->cfg (configuration/lock object type): The concrete type that cfg has (and its fields) may determine whether LFS_LOCK's behavior depends on runtime state. Knowing this type lets us inspect any lock-object state that could make LFS_LOCK return non-constant values.\n- preprocessor configuration macros that determine LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK expansion (thread-safety / lock-related macros): Many codebases make locking macros conditional on build-time flags (e.g. a threadsafe flag that turns locks into no-ops). To decide if the controlling expression is invariant we need the relevant compile-time macros and their values that govern the expansion of LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK.\n- LFS_TRACE (macro/function definition): LFS_TRACE is present in the function and may be a macro that introduces additional control (for example, conditionally compiled logging that could alter control flow or evaluation). Inspecting it ensures no hidden invariant controlling expressions are introduced by tracing macros.\n\nIncluding these symbols lets the analyser determine whether err (and thus if (err)) can be an invariant (always true/false) due to locking macros or build-time configuration, which is necessary to assess compliance with the MISRA C rule on invariant controlling expressions."
