  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not present pointer types that could/should be const-qualified or are simple non-pointer operations. Examples: declarations and uses of the local integer 'err', the string literals used in tracing, and the final 'return err;' do not involve pointer const-qualification. The 'path' parameter in the function signature is already const-qualified, so it is not suspicious. The listed fragments include every occurrence in this function where non-const pointers are declared, passed, or cast and therefore warrant review for possible const-qualification; other lines either contain no pointers or already use appropriate const qualification."
