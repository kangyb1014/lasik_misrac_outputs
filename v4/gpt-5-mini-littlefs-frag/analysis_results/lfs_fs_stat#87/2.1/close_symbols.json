  "explanation": "Required symbols and reasons:\n\n- lfs_fs_stat_: This is the direct callee. Its control-flow (whether it always returns, calls exit/longjmp, or otherwise makes later code unreachable) is essential to determine reachability of the code after the call (LFS_TRACE, LFS_UNLOCK, return).\n\n- LFS_LOCK: Used at function start and its return value controls an early return. Need its definition/expansion to determine whether it can fail, return non-zero, or perform non-local control-flow (e.g., longjmp/exit) that would affect reachability of subsequent statements.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Called before returning. If this macro/function has non-local control-flow or is conditionally compiled out, it affects whether code after err = lfs_fs_stat_ is reachable and whether unlocking is guaranteed.\n\n- LFS_TRACE: Tracing macro may expand to nothing or to expressions with side effects or non-local control-flow; need to confirm it does not introduce unreachable code or alter reachability.\n\n- lfs_t: Type of the first parameter; its definition (especially the cfg member) is needed to understand how LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK operate and whether any member access can cause non-local behavior or be optimized away.\n\n- struct lfs_fsinfo: Type of the second parameter; include to check whether any macros or functions (e.g., tracing) inspect it in ways that affect control flow.\n\n- lfs_gstate_needssuperblock, lfs_fs_disk_version, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_superblock_fromle32: These are callees of lfs_fs_stat_. To determine if lfs_fs_stat_ can fail to return (or can perform non-local control-flow) you must inspect these functions; any non-returning behavior in them would make code in lfs_fs_stat after the call unreachable.\n\nIncluding these symbols lets the next analyst see all relevant definitions/expansions that can influence control flow and thus determine whether any statements in lfs_fs_stat are unreachable (MISRA rule violation)."
