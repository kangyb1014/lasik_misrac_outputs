  "explanation": "- lfs_fs_stat_: The target delegates all real work to this helper. You must inspect its implementation/prototype to see whether it (or any functions it calls) mutate either the lfs object or the fsinfo data \u2014 this directly determines whether the pointer parameters could be const.\n- lfs_t: The definition of the file-system state object is required to see which fields are mutable, the type and const-qualification of the cfg field (lfs->cfg), and whether passing lfs as const* would be legal.\n- struct lfs_fsinfo: The pointed-to structure must be inspected to determine if it is treated as an output/updatable structure (fields written) or read-only; that decides whether the fsinfo parameter could be const-qualified.\n- LFS_LOCK and LFS_UNLOCK: These macros/functions operate on lfs->cfg. They may perform writes or require non-const cfg pointers; their definitions are necessary to know whether taking lfs (and/or its cfg field) as const* is possible.\n- LFS_TRACE: Although typically a logging macro, it takes pointer arguments; include its definition to ensure it does not perform mutations (casting to void* or writes) that would prevent const qualification.\n- lfs_gstate_needssuperblock, lfs_fs_disk_version, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_superblock_fromle32: These are the callees of lfs_fs_stat_. If any of them write through pointers reachable from the lfs or fsinfo arguments (directly or indirectly), that prevents making those pointers const. You need their prototypes/implementations to trace any writes to data reachable via the function parameters."
