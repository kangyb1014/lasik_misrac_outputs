  "explanation": "The only controlling expression that is invariant is the if (err) in lfs_file_size, because LFS_LOCK is defined to the constant 0. This makes the if condition predictably false and thus an invariant controlling expression that should be investigated under MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. Other control expressions in the provided code are not invariant: the for-loop condition in lfs_mlist_isopen depends on the list contents, the if in lfs_file_size_ depends on file->flags (and may be excluded by LFS_READONLY), and there are no do/while or intentionally infinite-loop constructs here that would be permitted by the rule's exceptions. LFS_UNLOCK, LFS_TRACE, and LFS_ASSERT are not controlling expressions and do not create invariant conditions, so they do not need investigation for this rule."
