  "explanation": "LFS_LOCK \u2014 definition/expansion and return semantics are required to know whether the early \"if (err) return err;\" can be proven always true/always false or whether LFS_LOCK can be a non-returning call (e.g. longjmp/abort) that makes subsequent code unreachable.\nLFS_UNLOCK \u2014 definition/expansion is required to see whether it contains control-flow (return/longjmp) that could make code after the call unreachable or change reachability assumptions.\nLFS_TRACE \u2014 may expand to code with side effects or non-returning behavior in some builds; need its definition to rule out hidden control-flow that affects reachability.\nLFS_ASSERT \u2014 assertion implementation may abort/longjmp on failure or be a no-op; its definition determines whether evaluation of lfs_mlist_isopen can make later code unreachable.\nlfs_mlist_isopen \u2014 its prototype/implementation could perform non-local control flow (abort/longjmp) or always fail/succeed in some builds; needed to determine if the LFS_ASSERT/lfs_mlist_isopen pair can make subsequent statements unreachable.\nlfs_file_size_ \u2014 the called helper must be checked for non-returning behavior (infinite loop, abort, longjmp) so that the statements after its call (trace, unlock, return) are not provably unreachable.\nlfs_max \u2014 called by lfs_file_size_; include because if lfs_file_size_ is implemented in terms of lfs_max that itself could be non-returning, that affects reachability of code after lfs_file_size_.\nlfs_t, lfs_file_t, lfs_soff_t, struct lfs_mlist \u2014 type definitions are required to check return-value conversions/compatibility and whether any implicit trap representations or unusual attributes (e.g., noreturn attributes attached to types or members) affect control-flow/reachability analysis.\nPRIu32 \u2014 format macro used in LFS_TRACE; its definition may affect the trace call expansion on some platforms/configs and thus could affect whether LFS_TRACE is a simple call or expands to something with control-flow consequences.\n\nCollectively these symbols (macros, functions, and types) must be inspected to determine whether any statement in lfs_file_size is provably never executed (i.e., truly unreachable) under the project/build configurations."
