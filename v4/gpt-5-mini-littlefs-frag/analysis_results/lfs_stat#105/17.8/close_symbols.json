  "explanation": "- LFS_LOCK: This is invoked with lfs->cfg. If LFS_LOCK is a macro (or an inline wrapper) it could expand into code that assigns to or otherwise modifies the local parameter variable lfs (or its fields) in lfs_stat. To prove lfs_stat does not modify its parameter variables we must inspect the LFS_LOCK definition/expansion and any side effects it produces.\n\n- LFS_UNLOCK: Same rationale as LFS_LOCK \u2014 the unlock operation may be a macro or inline code that could modify local variables; its definition must be checked to ensure it does not assign to the function parameters (lfs, path, info).\n\n- LFS_TRACE: A logging macro can expand into arbitrary code. Because it is passed (void*)lfs, path and (void*)info, a pathological macro expansion could modify those parameter variables. Inspecting LFS_TRACE is necessary to ensure it only reads the arguments and does not assign to the parameter identifiers.\n\n- lfs_stat_: Although a normal function call cannot change the caller's parameter variables, lfs_stat_ might be a macro/inline that expands in-place and could modify the lfs_stat parameters. Include its definition to confirm it is a true function (no in-place modification) or, if a macro/inline, to inspect whether it assigns to lfs, path, or info.\n\n- lfs_t (type/definition, including cfg member): You need the full lfs_t layout to see what lfs->cfg is (type and qualifiers) and to confirm pointer/const qualifications of the lfs parameter. Knowing the type helps determine whether expressions in the function/macros could rebind or modify the pointer parameter itself versus the object it points to.\n\n- struct lfs_info (type/definition): Inspecting this type clarifies whether casts/uses (e.g. (void*)info) or downstream macros/functions could attempt to reassign the info parameter itself versus modifying the object it points to. It also confirms pointer/const qualifications.\n\nThese symbols together let the analyst determine whether any macro expansion or inline code invoked by lfs_stat performs assignments to the parameter variables (lfs, path, info), which would violate the MISRA rule; if all expansions/functions only read parameters or modify pointed-to objects, lfs_stat will comply."
