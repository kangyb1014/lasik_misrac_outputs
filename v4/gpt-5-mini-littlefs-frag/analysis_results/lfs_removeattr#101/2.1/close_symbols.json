  "explanation": "LFS_LOCK: Must be analyzed to determine its control-flow and return behaviour (does it always return non-zero, can it longjmp/exit/return from the caller, or does it expand to code that changes reachability?). Whether the initial 'if (err) return err;' can always be taken depends on LFS_LOCK's implementation.\n\nLFS_UNLOCK: Needed to ensure the call just before function exit is reachable and to check whether LFS_UNLOCK may alter control-flow (e.g. contain a return/exit/longjmp) that would make subsequent code unreachable or change reachability assumptions.\n\nLFS_TRACE: Typically a macro that can expand to nothing or to logging code; its expansion could contain control-flow altering constructs in some builds. To prove there is no unreachable code you must know how LFS_TRACE expands in the build being analyzed.\n\nlfs_removeattr_: The function called in the body \u2014 its implementation could not return (e.g. call exit/longjmp) or could always return a particular value that makes later code unreachable in some paths; its definition is required to reason about reachability of subsequent statements and the final return.\n\nlfs_t (definition) / type of lfs->cfg: The type of lfs and its cfg member is required because LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK are invoked with lfs->cfg; their semantics may depend on the cfg object layout/values or macros accessing fields of cfg. Knowing the type lets you correctly interpret the invoked macros/functions and whether any compile-time/conditional macros make code unreachable."
