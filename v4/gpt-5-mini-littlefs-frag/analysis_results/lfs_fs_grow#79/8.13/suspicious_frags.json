  "explanation": "I selected fragments where non-const pointers are either (a) used as function parameters or arguments (possible candidates for const qualification if the callee only reads the pointee) or (b) struct members that are raw pointers and might be candidates for const qualification. These are the places most relevant to MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13.\n\nWhy other fragments were NOT selected:\n- The field \"const struct lfs_config *cfg;\" is already const-qualified, so it does not violate Rule 8.13.\n- The local variables root and superblock are non-pointer objects whose addresses are passed to functions; they are intended as output/read-write buffers in these calls (the code subsequently converts/assigns and commits superblock and updates root), so their addresses should be non-const pointers and are therefore not flagged.\n- The function bodies clearly modify lfs state (for example lfs->block_count is assigned), so the lfs_t *lfs parameter is intentionally non-const in cases where the function mutates the object; such usages should not be changed to const and thus were not listed as suspicious beyond the two function signatures included for review (these were included because the precise callee semantics need checking).\n- Macros LFS_LOCK/LFS_UNLOCK/LFS_TRACE expand to no-ops or casts and do not introduce pointer-type issues by themselves.\n- Other declarations (e.g. cache fields) are not shown as pointer types in the provided snippet or are clearly part of mutable state (e.g. lookahead buffer is used for read/write operations), so they are not candidates for const-qualification.\n\nIf any of the selected function calls (lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_get, lfs_dir_commit) only read the data pointed to by their pointer parameters, their parameter types should be reviewed to ensure they use pointer-to-const where appropriate. Conversely, if they modify the pointees, the non-const usage is appropriate."
