  "explanation": "Brief rationale for each symbol (why required to decide if any controlling expression in lfs_fs_mkconsistent is invariant):\n\n- LFS_LOCK\n  - The first controlling expression is if (err) where err is set to the result of LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg). You must see the definition/implementation of LFS_LOCK (or macro expansion) to determine whether it can produce different values at runtime or is a compile-time constant/invariant.\n\n- lfs_fs_mkconsistent_\n  - The second assignment to err comes from lfs_fs_mkconsistent_(lfs). To decide whether the later return/trace/condition is invariant you need the prototype/implementation of this function (or whether it is a thin wrapper returning a constant).\n\n- lfs_fs_forceconsistency, lfs_gstate_xor, lfs_gstate_iszero, lfs_dir_fetch, lfs_dir_commit\n  - These are the static callees of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_. The return value of lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (and thus the value of err) may depend on their behavior. To determine whether the controlling expression based on err can be invariant you must inspect these functions' behavior and return values.\n\n- lfs_t (type definition, including member cfg)\n  - lfs_fs_mkconsistent passes lfs and uses lfs->cfg. You need the lfs_t definition to know the type/semantics of cfg and whether the contents of lfs can make LFS_LOCK or lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ produce variable results.\n\n- configuration type of lfs->cfg (e.g. lfs_config or equivalent)\n  - LFS_LOCK takes lfs->cfg as argument. The definition of the cfg type and any fields used by LFS_LOCK are necessary to determine if LFS_LOCK's result depends on runtime state.\n\n- error return code constants used/returned by LFS_LOCK and lfs_fs_mkconsistent_ (e.g. LFS_ERR_OK and other LFS_ERR_* values)\n  - The condition if (err) is evaluated as true/false based on specific error codes. Knowing the set of possible return codes and which correspond to zero/non-zero is required to judge whether the controlling expression could be an invariant (always false/always true).\n\nNotes: LFS_UNLOCK and LFS_TRACE are not required to decide whether the controlling expressions are invariant (they do not affect the controlling expressions), so they are omitted. The focus is on symbols that set or determine the value of err and the types whose runtime state those functions inspect."
