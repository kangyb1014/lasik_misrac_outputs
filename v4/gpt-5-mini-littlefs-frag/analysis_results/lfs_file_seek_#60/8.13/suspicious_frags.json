  "explanation": "I selected fragments that involve passing non-const pointers (or taking addresses) where a const-qualified pointer parameter might be appropriate: the function declaration itself (non-const pointer parameters) and the call sites that take addresses or pass pointers to other functions (lfs_file_size_, lfs_ctz_index, lfs_file_flush). Other code fragments were not marked because they do not involve passing pointers to functions or creating pointer values that could reasonably be const-qualified: for example, direct assignments to file members (file->pos = npos; file->off = noff;) clearly modify the pointee and thus must use non-const pointers; simple field accesses and integer comparisons (e.g. checks against file->cache.off, file->cache.size, lfs->file_max, lfs->cfg->block_size) are value reads and do not create pointer parameters that could be const-qualified in this scope. These non-selected fragments therefore do not need investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
