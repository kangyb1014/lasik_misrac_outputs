  "explanation": "The only controlling expression in lfs_dir_tell is 'if (err)'. 'err' is assigned from LFS_LOCK(lfs->cfg), so to decide whether that controlling expression can be invariant you must know what LFS_LOCK does/expands to and whether its result can be a compile-time or run-time constant.  - LFS_LOCK: required to see whether it is a macro or function that can evaluate to a constant (for example a no-op returning 0 under certain compile-time options), or whether it reads state and can change at run-time. Also inspect any conditional compilation used in its definition.  - LFS_UNLOCK: needed to understand the locking/unlocking pair and semantics of LFS_LOCK (helps determine whether locking is a no-op in some builds and thus LFS_LOCK always returns a constant).  - lfs_t (definition): LFS_LOCK is called with lfs->cfg; the structure of lfs_t (and how cfg is stored) is needed to see what is passed into LFS_LOCK and whether that could make the call invariant.  - type of lfs->cfg (configuration struct/type): LFS_LOCK may inspect fields of the configuration (e.g. a flag that disables locking). Knowing the cfg type lets you see if compile-time/default values make LFS_LOCK's result invariant.  - lfs_soff_t (typedef / underlying integer type): the function returns err when LFS_LOCK fails; knowing the return typedef is needed to check type conversions and whether returning 'err' (an int) could hide invariance issues or produce unintended constant returns.  These symbols together let you determine whether 'if (err)' can be an essentially invariant (constant) controlling expression under any build/configuration, which is what MISRA C's rule targets."
