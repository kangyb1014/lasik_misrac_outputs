  "explanation": "For determining whether metal_condition_wait violates the MISRA rule banning direct or indirect recursion, the analyser must inspect any functions it calls (and any functions those call) to ensure none lead back to metal_condition_wait. Each listed symbol is required for that transitive-cycle analysis:\n\n- metal_mutex_is_acquired: Direct callee of metal_condition_wait \u2014 must be checked for any direct or indirect calls back to metal_condition_wait.\n- metal_mutex_release: Direct callee \u2014 must be checked for calls that could eventually call metal_condition_wait.\n- metal_mutex_acquire: Direct callee \u2014 must be checked for calls that could eventually call metal_condition_wait.\n- metal_irq_save_disable: Appears in the static call graph as related to mutex/acquire paths; include to examine any paths from mutex/IRQ helper functions back to metal_condition_wait.\n- metal_irq_restore_enable: Related to mutex/release paths; include to check for indirect calls back to metal_condition_wait.\n- metal_linux_irq_set_enable: Related IRQ helper appearing in callers of mutex functions; include to ensure no call chain returns to metal_condition_wait.\n- metal_linux_irq_handling: Another IRQ-related function that appears in mutex callers; include for the same reason.\n- mutex_thread: A thread-level caller of mutex operations; include to verify there is no path from called mutex/IRQ helpers returning into thread code that calls metal_condition_wait.\n- consumer_thread: A known caller of metal_condition_wait \u2014 include to inspect whether any callees reachable from metal_condition_wait can call back into this thread and thus back to metal_condition_wait.\n- producer_thread: Same reason as consumer_thread \u2014 a caller of metal_condition_wait that must be examined for potential back-edges.\n- metal_condition_signal: Closely related condition API (used by consumer/producer) \u2014 include to check whether any condition-related helpers call metal_condition_wait (possible indirect recursion via signaling/wakeup helpers).\n\nThe analyser should expand the call graph of these symbols to determine if any path exists from metal_condition_wait through its callees (and their callees) back to metal_condition_wait. If no such path exists, the MISRA recursion rule is not violated."
