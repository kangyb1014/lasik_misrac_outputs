  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe local pointer 'virt' is only used to compute addresses and to call metal_virt2phys(virt + offset, ...); it is never used to modify the memory it points to. Therefore it could be declared as 'const uint8_t *virt' to indicate read-only access. As written ('uint8_t *virt;') it lacks the const qualification and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (Note: if metal_virt2phys or other called APIs require a non-const pointer, those APIs should be updated to accept a pointer-to-const if they do not modify the memory.)\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified metal_map code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/705.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_map:\n```c\nint metal_map(int fd, off_t offset, size_t size, int expand, int flags,\n\t      void **result)\n{\n\tint prot = PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, error;\n\tvoid *mem;\n\n\tflags |= MAP_SHARED;\n\n\tif (fd < 0) {\n\t\tfd = -1;\n\t\tflags = MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS;\n\t} else if (expand) {\n\t\toff_t reqsize = offset + size;\n\t\tstruct stat stat;\n\n\t\terror = flock(fd, LOCK_EX) < 0 ? -errno : 0;\n\t\tif (!error)\n\t\t\terror = fstat(fd, &stat);\n\t\tif (!error && stat.st_size < reqsize)\n\t\t\terror = ftruncate(fd, reqsize);\n\t\tif (!error)\n\t\t\tflock(fd, LOCK_UN);\n\t\tif (error)\n\t\t\treturn -errno;\n\t}\n\n\tmem = mmap(NULL, size, prot, flags, fd, offset);\n\tif (mem == MAP_FAILED)\n\t\treturn -errno;\n\t*result = mem;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n\n<instruction>\n\nPlease provide the modified metal_map code.\n\nThe information below explains how I\u2019ll use the function you provide. Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original metal_map with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as metal_map.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call metal_map to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of metal_map as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, metal_map will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_map as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
