  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "strcmp(bus->name, name) reads both operands until a terminating '\\0'. The code does not validate that 'name' is non-NULL and null-terminated nor that 'bus->name' is null-terminated (definition of struct metal_bus not shown). If either operand is not a pointer to a NUL-terminated buffer (for example bus->name is a fixed-size char array not guaranteed to contain a '\\0', or caller passes a non-terminated buffer or NULL), strcmp can read beyond object bounds. Therefore Rule 21.17 is violated unless callers/struct invariants guarantee both strings are valid NUL-terminated, non-NULL strings."
