  "explanation": "I only flagged code fragments that involve pointer declarations or uses of pointer types that could plausibly be const-qualified (function parameter pointer, local pointer variable, pointers passed to list APIs, struct pointer fields, and the list node pointers). Other parts of the function do not involve pointer types or pointer targets that can be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - Scalar declarations and operations (e.g. the int irq_base local, use of cntr->irq_base and cntr->irq_num as integer values). - Return/error handling and comparisons against integer constants (e.g. METAL_IRQ_ANY, return -EINVAL) are unrelated to pointer const-qualification. - Calls and results involving non-pointer types (e.g. metal_irq_allocate returning an int) are not relevant. - Function-pointer fields (the irq_set_enable/irq_register members) are function pointers; const-qualification of the pointed-to function type is not applicable in the same way as object pointers. The listed suspicious fragments should be reviewed to determine whether the pointer targets could be made const-qualified without breaking intended mutability."
