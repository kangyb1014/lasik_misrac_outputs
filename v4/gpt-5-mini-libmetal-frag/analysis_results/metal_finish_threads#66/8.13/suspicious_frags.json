  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointer types should be const-qualified when the pointed-to objects are not modified. The only places in this function that involve pointer types or pointer dereferencing are the function parameter declaration, the local pointer initialization (including the cast), and the use of that pointer to index elements. Other fragments in the function do not introduce pointer types that could/should be const-qualified (e.g. the integer parameters/variables, the NULL check, the cast-to-void of the return value) and therefore do not need to be investigated for Rule 8.13."
