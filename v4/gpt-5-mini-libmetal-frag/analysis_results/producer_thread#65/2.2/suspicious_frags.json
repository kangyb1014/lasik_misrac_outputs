Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I only flagged the explicit (void)arg; statements (one in producer_thread and one in consumer_thread). These are executed no-op expressions whose removal would not change runtime behaviour (they only suppress unused-parameter warnings). All other fragments in the provided code are involved in synchronization or modify/inspect the shared state (counter) and thus can affect program behaviour: the mutex acquire/release, condition-wait loops, counter increments/decrements, and the condition signals are active synchronization operations whose removal would change timing or correctness. The static initializations (e.g. METAL_CONDITION_INIT, METAL_MUTEX_DEFINE, and the static counter initialization) are initializations (not assignments) and are not candidates for dead-code removal. There is no unreachable code in the snippet presented. Therefore no other fragments need investigation for Rule 2.2 based on the provided code."
