  "explanation": "To determine whether the strncpy call in metal_add_page_size can access memory beyond source or destination bounds you need the following symbols and why:\n\n- _metal\n  - Reason: _metal is the global object being written to. You must see its definition to know the size and layout of page_sizes and to confirm that indexing into _metal.page_sizes[index] is valid and that page_sizes[] exists with the expected element count.\n\n- struct definition of _metal.page_sizes[] element (the page-size record; specifically the declaration of the path member)\n  - Reason: The destination for strncpy is _metal.page_sizes[index].path. You need the exact declaration (e.g., char path[N];) to know the length of the destination buffer so you can determine if copying PATH_MAX bytes can overflow the destination.\n\n- PATH_MAX\n  - Reason: PATH_MAX is used as the length argument to strncpy. Its numeric value determines how many bytes strncpy will attempt to write into the destination and read from the source; compare this value against the destination buffer size and the source object size.\n\n- MAX_PAGE_SIZES\n  - Reason: The function checks index >= MAX_PAGE_SIZES before writing; you must confirm that MAX_PAGE_SIZES matches the actual allocated length of _metal.page_sizes[] so the index check actually prevents out-of-bounds writes to the page_sizes array.\n\n- strncpy (C library function; prototype/semantics from <string.h>)\n  - Reason: The MISRA rule applies to standard string functions. You must use the exact semantics of strncpy: it writes up to n bytes to dest, reads up to n bytes from src, does not guarantee NUL-termination if src length >= n, and will pad dest with NULs if src length < n. These details determine whether strncpy can read past the source object or write past the destination.\n\n- metal_init_page_sizes (caller that provides the path argument)\n  - Reason: To know the size and provenance of the source buffer pointed to by the path parameter you must inspect the caller(s) that supply path. If the caller passes a string literal or a buffer whose allocated size is < PATH_MAX, strncpy might read beyond the source. metal_init_page_sizes is the known caller in the static call graph and must be examined (and any other callers, if present) to establish the source object bounds.\n\n(With these symbols you can check: dest buffer size >= PATH_MAX? index checks guarantee in-range access to page_sizes[]? source object passed as path has at least PATH_MAX bytes or is otherwise known to be NUL-terminated within PATH_MAX? and strncpy semantics regarding reads/writes.)"
