  "explanation": "Fragments not reported are not relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible). Local scalar variables (irq_tocheck, irq_end_tocheck, irq_base, irq_num and arithmetic/flow control) are not pointer types and therefore outside the scope of this rule. The struct definitions and fields shown in the additional code (struct metal_list members next/prev, struct metal_irq_controller fields such as void *arg, function-pointer members, and struct metal_irq *irqs) were not flagged because these members are typically mutable or intended to be modified by other code (so making their types const may be inappropriate). The list head declared by METAL_DECLARE_LIST(irq_cntrs) and the macros used to traverse/obtain the container may require non-const types by design; only pointer usages within this function that appear to be read-only were selected for investigation."
