Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "For checking MISRA rule about well-formed for loops we must inspect any for loops that occur in the target function and in any functions called from inside such for loops (the rule defines the loop body to include behaviour of called functions), and we must know which objects are read/modified by those functions. The symbols listed are the minimal additional symbols required to perform that analysis for shmem_child: \n\n- metal_shmem_open: the direct callee; its implementation may contain loops or side-effects on objects visible to a loop in shmem_child (or be inline-expanded). \n- metal_shmem_open_generic, metal_open, metal_shmem_try_map: transitive callees of metal_shmem_open (from the static call graph). Include them because metal_shmem_open may delegate to them or be inlined, and they may contain loops or modify objects used as loop counters or loop-control flags.\n- metal_io_virt: direct callee that returns a virtual pointer; its implementation could have side-effects or loops that modify objects visible to a loop in shmem_child.\n- metal_io_phys: direct callee that returns a physical offset; include to check for side-effects or modifications of objects that could be used as loop counters.\n- metal_io_phys_to_virt, metal_io_virt_to_phys: direct callees used in comparisons; their implementations could modify or access objects relevant to loop correctness (e.g. modify globals or memory visible to loop counters).\n- metal_io_finish: cleanup function called at end; include to see if it contains loops or side-effects relevant to for-loop behaviour.\n- atomic_fetch_add: used to increment nb_err; required to know exact side-effects semantics (it modifies nb_err). If nb_err or similarly modified objects were used as loop counters/flags, this would matter for clauses 2\u20134 of the rule.\n- nb_err: the global atomic variable modified by atomic_fetch_add; its type and modification behaviour must be known since the rule forbids loop-counter modification in the loop body and forbids second/third clauses to use objects modified in the body.\n- metal_log and METAL_LOG_ERROR: logging symbols used in the function; include their definitions to confirm they do not contain hidden side-effects (loops or modifications of objects that could be used as loop counters) when called inside a for loop.\n- METAL_BAD_OFFSET: constant compared against phys; include to ensure the comparison semantics and whether its definition could affect reasoning about which objects are used in loop clauses.\n\nNotes: shmem_child itself contains no for statement, so on the surface it does not violate the rule. However, to be certain (and per the MISRA wording that the loop body includes called functions), any analysis that tries to certify compliance for code that contains for loops calling these functions or for future changes must inspect the implementations of the listed symbols. The list is therefore the close/minimal set needed to determine whether any relevant for-loops (in shmem_child or in called functions) would be well-formed under the MISRA rule."
