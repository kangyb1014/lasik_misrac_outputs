  "explanation": "Other pointer-related fragments in the function were not included because they are not viable candidates for const-qualification: the variable 'io' (declared as 'struct metal_io_region *io;') is passed by address to metal_shmem_open(&io) and later to metal_io_finish(io) so it is initialized/owned and potentially modified by those API functions and therefore cannot be made a pointer-to-const. The function must match the expected thread-entry signature used by the surrounding codebase (void *(*)(void *)) so the parameter type required by that API is not considered changeable here. Numeric and scalar variables (size, phys, error, nb_err) are not pointer types and thus not relevant to Rule 8.13. API calls such as metal_io_phys, metal_io_phys_to_virt and metal_io_virt_to_phys operate according to their own interfaces; where a pointer cannot be safely const-qualified because the API expects to modify or manage the underlying object, those uses are intentionally not flagged."
