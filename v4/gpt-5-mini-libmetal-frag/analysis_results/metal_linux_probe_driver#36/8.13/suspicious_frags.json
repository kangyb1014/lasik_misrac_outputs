  "explanation": "I flagged the function pointer parameters and each use of struct members that supply string data (lbus->bus_name, ldrv->drv_name, ldrv->mod_name) because these are passed to routines (snprintf, sysfs_open_driver) where the pointed-to data appears to be used only for reading; their declarations should be inspected to see if they can be const-qualified. I did not flag the local command buffer or its uses (snprintf writing into command, then passing command to system/metal_log) because the buffer is written to and therefore cannot be const. I did not flag the integer variable ret or the null checks/assignments on ldrv->sdrv that modify state, since those involve writable data and so const-qualification would not be appropriate. I also did not flag use of __func__ or the format string literals as those are read-only by nature."
