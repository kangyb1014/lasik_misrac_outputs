  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they either do not involve pointer types or the pointers must be non-const by design: - 'size_t processed;' and 'processed = 0;' are scalar usage, not pointer qualification issues. - Assignments to connection->rq.client_aware and connection->in_access_handler are writes to the object referred to by 'connection' (the connection object is intentionally modified), so the connection pointer cannot be const. - The addresses passed as &processed and &connection->rq.client_context are output/in-out parameters that are expected to be modified by the handler and therefore must be non-const. - The CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR call and the return statements do not introduce additional pointer qualification concerns. These remaining lines do not present further opportunities to add const qualification without changing semantics, so they do not require investigation for Rule 8.13."
