  "scenario": "The local pointer 'urh' is initialized from 'md->urh' and is not used to modify the pointed-to object in run_usock (only passed to MHD_upgrade_action). Therefore, unless MHD_upgrade_action requires a non-const pointer and actually modifies the object, 'urh' could and should be declared to point to a const-qualified type (for example: const struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh = md->urh). Omitting the const qualifier here violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
