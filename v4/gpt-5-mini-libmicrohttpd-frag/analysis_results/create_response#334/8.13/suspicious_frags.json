  "explanation": "I reviewed the function for places where a pointer might be declared without const qualification while it could be const. The selected fragments are the places in this function where pointer types are accepted, assigned, or forwarded and therefore should be checked for whether the pointed-to type could/should be const-qualified (function parameters, pointer-to-pointer usage, pointer assignments and arguments forwarded to other APIs). Other code fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because:\n\n- The parameters declared with const (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) already have the const qualification and therefore comply with the rule for those data pointers.\n- The size_t *upload_data_size is intentionally non-const because the function modifies *upload_data_size; qualifying the pointed-to object as const would prevent required writes.\n- Local pointers to mutable objects that the function writes through (e.g., struct Request *request, struct Session *session) must not be const because the code updates their contents (allocating request, setting request->pp, session->start, etc.).\n- Calls that create/modify resources (calloc, MHD_create_post_processor, MHD_post_process, MHD_destroy_post_processor, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response) imply non-const usage of the associated pointers by the underlying APIs; their parameters/returns must be treated according to those APIs rather than made const here without checking the API contracts.\n\nTherefore only the listed fragments need further inspection to determine whether the pointed-to types could or should be const-qualified to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
