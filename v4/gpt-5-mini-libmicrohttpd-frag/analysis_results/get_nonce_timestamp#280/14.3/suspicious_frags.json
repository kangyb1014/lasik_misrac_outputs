  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function were not flagged because they do not present an invariant controlling expression: \n- The initial if (0 == noncelen) depends on the variable noncelen (and potentially strlen(nonce)) and is not a constant/invariant expression.\n- The final timestamp check if (TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN != MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_(...)) depends on the return value of a function call and thus is not invariant.\n- There are no do-while loops or intended infinite loops in this function that would fall under the stated exceptions. Therefore these parts need not be investigated for Rule 14.3."
