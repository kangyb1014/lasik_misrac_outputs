  "explanation": "No other code fragments modify function parameters. 'nonce' is declared as 'const char *const' (the pointer and pointee are const) and is not assigned to anywhere; pointer arithmetic using 'nonce + noncelen - TIMESTAMP_CHARS_LEN' does not modify the parameter. 'ptimestamp' is declared 'uint64_t *const' (the pointer itself is const) and the function only passes it to MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_, which may modify the object pointed to (allowed by the rule) but does not modify the parameter variable. The rest of the function only performs comparisons and returns and does not assign to any other parameter variables."
