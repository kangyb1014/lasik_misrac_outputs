  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe local variable nodep is declared as \"void **nodep\" but it is only used to read the stored pointer returned by tfind (it is assigned from tfind and dereferenced only to read *nodep). Since *nodep is not modified through nodep, the pointed-to type could be const-qualified (e.g. declare as \"void * const *nodep\"). Therefore this use violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified MHD_ip_limit_del code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/2585.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_ip_limit_del:\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_limit_del (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n                  const struct sockaddr_storage *addr,\n                  socklen_t addrlen)\n{\n  struct MHD_IPCount search_key;\n  struct MHD_IPCount *found_key;\n  void **nodep;\n\n  daemon = MHD_get_master (daemon);\n  /* Ignore if no connection limit assigned */\n  if (0 == daemon->per_ip_connection_limit)\n    return;\n  /* Initialize search key */\n  if (MHD_NO == MHD_ip_addr_to_key (addr,\n                                    addrlen,\n                                    &search_key))\n    return;\n\n  MHD_ip_count_lock (daemon);\n\n  /* Search for the IP address */\n  if (NULL == (nodep = tfind (&search_key,\n                              &daemon->per_ip_connection_count,\n                              &MHD_ip_addr_compare)))\n  {\n    /* Something's wrong if we couldn't find an IP address\n     * that was previously added */\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Failed to find previously-added IP address.\\n\"));\n  }\n  found_key = (struct MHD_IPCount *) *nodep;\n  /* Validate existing count for IP address */\n  if (0 == found_key->count)\n  {\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Previously-added IP address had counter of zero.\\n\"));\n  }\n  /* Remove the node entirely if count reduces to 0 */\n  if (0 == --found_key->count)\n  {\n    tdelete (found_key,\n             &daemon->per_ip_connection_count,\n             &MHD_ip_addr_compare);\n    MHD_ip_count_unlock (daemon);\n    free (found_key);\n  }\n  else\n    MHD_ip_count_unlock (daemon);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n\n<instruction>\n\nPlease provide the modified MHD_ip_limit_del code.\n\nThe information below explains how I\u2019ll use the function you provide. Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original MHD_ip_limit_del with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as MHD_ip_limit_del.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call MHD_ip_limit_del to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_ip_limit_del as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, MHD_ip_limit_del will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_ip_limit_del as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
