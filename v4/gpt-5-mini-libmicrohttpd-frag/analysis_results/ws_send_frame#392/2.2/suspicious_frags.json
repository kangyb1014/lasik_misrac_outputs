Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "Other statements in the function are used to build and send the WebSocket frame and affect program behaviour: the frame[] initialisations (frame[0], frame[1], and the length bytes), the branches that set idx_first_rdata, the two for-loops that copy the header and payload (including the increments of idx_response), the NULL check and return on malloc failure, the mutex lock/unlock and abort() error handling, the send_all() calls accumulating output, free(response) and the final return. These operations are each observed to influence the constructed message, synchronization, resource management or return value and therefore are not candidates for dead code under MISRA Rule 2.2. No other statements appear to be executed without effect."
