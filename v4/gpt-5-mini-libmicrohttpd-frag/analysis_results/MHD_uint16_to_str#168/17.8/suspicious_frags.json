  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation under Rule 17.8 because they do not modify the function parameters themselves. Specifically: - Writing via *chr (e.g. '*chr = (char) ((char) digit + '0');') modifies the object pointed to by the pointer parameter buf, which is permitted; the pointer parameter buf itself is not assigned to anywhere (only a local pointer chr is set: 'chr = buf;'), so the pointer parameter is not modified. - Incrementing and assigning the local pointer chr (e.g. 'chr++;') and assigning/altering local variables (divisor, digit) are modifications of local objects, not of function parameters. - All other uses of val, buf_size, and buf are reads; only the two listed statements perform assignments to the parameter variables themselves, and thus are the relevant suspicious fragments for Rule 17.8."
