  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 is: A project shall not contain unreachable code.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.1.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe case label 'MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS' (commented \"Not possible\") is unreachable because the surrounding guard if (MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS != connection->tls_state) prevents entering the switch when tls_state == MHD_TLS_CONN_NO_TLS. As a result the code associated with that case (and only reachable via that case value) can never execute. This constitutes unreachable code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Suggested fixes: remove the unreachable case label, or move the panic/validation check outside the guarded if so that the NO_TLS value can be handled explicitly.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/3676.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario.

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_connection_update_event_loop_info as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
