  "explanation": "Other pointer uses in this function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: cookie is already declared as const char *; ret must be a non-const struct Session * because the function modifies the session (ret->rc, ret->start, ret->next and writes into ret->sid via snprintf); the global sessions pointer is assigned to and therefore must be non-const; the memory returned by calloc is initialized/modified and thus must be non-const; ret->sid is written with snprintf so it must not be const; passing ret->sid (char array) to strcmp which expects const char * is acceptable. Therefore these fragments are not candidates for const-qualification under the rule."
