  "explanation": "These are the only places in the function that modify the function parameters themselves. Modifying the pointer parameter 'data' (via pointer arithmetic and assignment) and the scalar parameter 'length' violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 and therefore should be investigated. Other mutations in the function (for example ctx->count += length; memcpy to ctx->buffer; md5_transform(ctx->H, ...)) modify the objects referred to by pointer parameters or local variables, which is permitted by the rule (the pointer\u2019s pointee may be modified). Local variables (bytes_have, bytes_left) are also safe to modify. The early return and assertions do not modify parameters."
