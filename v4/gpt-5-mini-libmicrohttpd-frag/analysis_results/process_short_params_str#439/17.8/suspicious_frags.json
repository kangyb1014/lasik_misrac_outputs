  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function do not need investigation for Rule 17.8 because they only read from the pointer parameters or pass them by value: the initial check 'if (0 == params_str[0])' and the fprintf call only access the object pointed to; the call to process_short_param passes the pointer value (does not modify the caller's pointer variable here); the return statements and final 'return PERF_RPL_PARAM_FULL_STR;' do not modify parameters. Only the locations listed above involve the function parameter itself in a context that warrants review for modification of the parameter variable."
