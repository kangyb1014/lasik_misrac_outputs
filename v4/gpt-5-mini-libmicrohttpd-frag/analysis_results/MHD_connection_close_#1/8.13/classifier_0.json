  "scenario": "The local pointer 'daemon' is declared as 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon = connection->daemon;' but in this function it is only used for read-only access (checking daemon->notify_completed, testing thread status via a macro, and reading notify_completed_cls). There are no modifications to the pointed-to MHD_Daemon object, so the pointer could and should be declared as 'const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' to satisfy MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If any macros or called functions require a non-const pointer, that would be the only legitimate reason to keep it non-const.)"
