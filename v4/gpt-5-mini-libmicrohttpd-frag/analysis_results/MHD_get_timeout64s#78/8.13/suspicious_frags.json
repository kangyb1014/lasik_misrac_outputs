  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not involve pointers that could or should be const-qualified and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - \"uint64_t utimeout;\" is an ordinary integer variable (not a pointer). - The comparison and return statements (if (INT64_MAX < utimeout), return -1, return (int64_t) utimeout;) perform arithmetic/flow control and do not involve pointer types. - The equality check against MHD_NO and the call result handling involve the return value of MHD_get_timeout64, not pointer qualifications. The only locations in this function that use pointer types or pass addresses (and thus might require const qualification consideration) are the function parameter declaration \"struct MHD_Daemon *daemon\" and the call site passing the address of utimeout (\"MHD_get_timeout64 (daemon, &utimeout)\")."
