  "explanation": "The only use of a <string.h> function in this snippet is strlen(CHAT_PAGE). No other calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen (other than this), or strspn are present. The remaining lines (function signature, declaration of res/ret, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response, return) do not invoke string.h functions nor perform direct buffer indexing, so they do not need investigation under Rule 21.17. Therefore the single fragment containing strlen(CHAT_PAGE) should be investigated for potential out-of-bounds access."
