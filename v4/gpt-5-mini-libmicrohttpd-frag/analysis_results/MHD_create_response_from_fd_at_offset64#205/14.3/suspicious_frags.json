  "explanation": "Only conditional/controlling expressions are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3. The listed fragments contain controlling expressions that are potentially invariant or partly invariant (compile-time sizeof comparison and signed casts of unsigned values) and therefore should be investigated. Other code in the function does not contain controlling expressions that could be invariant: the call to MHD_create_response_from_callback and the subsequent assignments (response->fd, response->is_pipe, response->fd_off, response->crc_cls) and the final return are ordinary expressions/statements not covered by Rule 14.3. There are no loops (for/while/do) or switch statements with constant controlling expressions elsewhere in the function, so no additional fragments need investigation for this specific rule."
