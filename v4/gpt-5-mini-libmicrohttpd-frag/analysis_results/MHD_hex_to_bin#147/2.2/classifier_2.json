  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_hex_to_bin:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_hex_to_bin (const char *hex,\n                size_t len,\n                void *bin)\n{\n  uint8_t *const out = (uint8_t *) bin;\n  size_t r;\n  size_t w;\n\n  if (0 == len)\n    return 0;\n  r = 0;\n  w = 0;\n  if (0 != len % 2)\n  {\n    /* Assume the first byte is encoded with single digit */\n    const int l = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    if (0 > l)\n      return 0;\n    out[w++] = (uint8_t) ((unsigned int) l);\n  }\n  while (r < len)\n  {\n    const int h = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    const int l = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    if ((0 > h) || (0 > l))\n      return 0;\n    out[w++] = (uint8_t) ( ((uint8_t) (((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) h)) << 4))\n                           | ((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) l)) );\n  }\n  mhd_assert (len == r);\n  mhd_assert ((len + 1) / 2 == w);\n  return w;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n  mhd_assert (len == r);\n  mhd_assert ((len + 1) / 2 == w);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "If mhd_assert is implemented as a run\u2011time diagnostic check (for example a function or macro that evaluates the expression and maybe logs or returns void) and it is executed in production builds but has no effect on program state or outputs, then those two calls are dead code: removing them would not affect program behaviour. In that situation Rule 2.2 is violated because the assertions are executed yet can be removed without changing program behaviour."
