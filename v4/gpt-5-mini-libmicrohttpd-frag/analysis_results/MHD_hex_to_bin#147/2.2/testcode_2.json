  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nIf mhd_assert is implemented as a run\u2011time diagnostic check (for example a function or macro that evaluates the expression and maybe logs or returns void) and it is executed in production builds but has no effect on program state or outputs, then those two calls are dead code: removing them would not affect program behaviour. In that situation Rule 2.2 is violated because the assertions are executed yet can be removed without changing program behaviour.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified MHD_hex_to_bin code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/4048.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_hex_to_bin:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_hex_to_bin (const char *hex,\n                size_t len,\n                void *bin)\n{\n  uint8_t *const out = (uint8_t *) bin;\n  size_t r;\n  size_t w;\n\n  if (0 == len)\n    return 0;\n  r = 0;\n  w = 0;\n  if (0 != len % 2)\n  {\n    /* Assume the first byte is encoded with single digit */\n    const int l = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    if (0 > l)\n      return 0;\n    out[w++] = (uint8_t) ((unsigned int) l);\n  }\n  while (r < len)\n  {\n    const int h = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    const int l = toxdigitvalue (hex[r++]);\n    if ((0 > h) || (0 > l))\n      return 0;\n    out[w++] = (uint8_t) ( ((uint8_t) (((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) h)) << 4))\n                           | ((uint8_t) ((unsigned int) l)) );\n  }\n  mhd_assert (len == r);\n  mhd_assert ((len + 1) / 2 == w);\n  return w;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n\n<instruction>\n\nPlease provide the modified MHD_hex_to_bin code.\n\nThe information below explains how I\u2019ll use the function you provide. Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original MHD_hex_to_bin with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as MHD_hex_to_bin.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call MHD_hex_to_bin to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_hex_to_bin as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, MHD_hex_to_bin will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_hex_to_bin as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
