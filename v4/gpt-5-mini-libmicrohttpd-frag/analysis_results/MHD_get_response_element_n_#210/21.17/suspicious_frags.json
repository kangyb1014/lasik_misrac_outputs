  "explanation": "MISRA C Rule 21.17 concerns use of <string.h> functions (memcpy, memcmp, strlen, etc.) that may access beyond object bounds. The only site in this function that could invoke such string handling operations is the call to MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_. That call uses three pointers/lengths (pos->header, key, pos->header_size / key_len) and the surrounding code does not validate that the memory for 'key' covers 'key_len' bytes nor that 'pos->header' covers 'pos->header_size' bytes. The three mhd_assert checks present only verify that key is non-NULL, that its first character is non-zero, and that key_len is non-zero; they do not guarantee the buffers are at least key_len bytes long, so these assertions are relevant to investigate. Other fragments of the function (the for-loop control, the return NULL, function signature, variable declaration) do not perform or initiate string handling and thus are not relevant to Rule 21.17 and do not need investigation in this context."
