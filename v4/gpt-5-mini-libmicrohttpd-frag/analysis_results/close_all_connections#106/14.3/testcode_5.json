  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 is: Controlling expressions shall not be invariant.\nHere are exceptions to this rule:\n1. Invariants that are used to create infinite loops are permitted.\n2. A do-while loop with an essentially Boolean controlling expression that evaluates to false and satisfies the constraints and semantics for an integer constant expression is permitted.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 14.3.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe controlling expression 'if (upg_allowed)' uses a const local boolean (const bool upg_allowed = (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_ALLOW_UPGRADE))); since upg_allowed is initialized once and never modified within the function, the controlling expression is invariant. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3 (controlling expressions shall not be invariant). The preprocessor 'else' pairing with the following 'if' does not remove the invariance of the 'if (upg_allowed)' test.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified close_all_connections code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/79.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of close_all_connections:\n```c\nstatic void\nclose_all_connections (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *pos;\n  const bool used_thr_p_c = MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ (daemon);\n#ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT\n  const bool upg_allowed = (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_ALLOW_UPGRADE));\n#endif /* UPGRADE_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) && defined(UPGRADE_SUPPORT)\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urhn;\n  const bool used_tls = (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS));\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT && UPGRADE_SUPPORT */\n\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original close_all_connections with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as close_all_connections.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call close_all_connections to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of close_all_connections as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, close_all_connections will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of close_all_connections as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
