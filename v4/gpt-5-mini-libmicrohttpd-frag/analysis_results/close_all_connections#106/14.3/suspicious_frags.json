  "explanation": "Other control expressions in the function do not appear to be invariant and therefore do not need investigation for Rule 14.3: - Loops whose controlling expressions assign from or traverse linked lists (e.g. while (NULL != (pos = daemon->new_connections_tail)), for/while loops that use pos = pos->prev, or urh = urh->prev) clearly depend on data that is modified within the loop. - Conditions that call macros or functions (e.g. MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_(daemon), MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_thread_handle_ID_join_thread_) may evaluate to different results at runtime and are not compile-time invariants. - The various MHD_PANIC and mhd_assert calls are not loop/switch controlling expressions subject to invariant-control concerns. - The final while (NULL != (pos = daemon->connections_tail)) and other loops that rely on cleanup/close_connection side-effects are dependent on state changes performed inside the loop and are not statically invariant. The selected fragments focus on uses of local const booleans (and the const initializers) as controlling predicates (alone or combined), which create controlling expressions that do not change during the function and therefore warrant review for compliance with MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.3."
