  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 14.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe for loop uses a helper variable (urhn) that is assigned inside the loop body and then read in the third clause: the loop header is \"for (urh = daemon->urh_tail; NULL != urh; urh = urhn)\" while the body contains \"urhn = urh->prev;\". Clause 3 of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 forbids the third clause from using objects that are modified in the loop body. Because the third clause reads urhn which is written inside the loop body, the loop is not well-formed per Rule 14.2.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified close_all_connections code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/71.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of close_all_connections:\n```c\nstatic void\nclose_all_connections (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  struct MHD_Connection *pos;\n  const bool used_thr_p_c = MHD_D_IS_USING_THREAD_PER_CONN_ (daemon);\n#ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT\n  const bool upg_allowed = (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_ALLOW_UPGRADE));\n#endif /* UPGRADE_SUPPORT */\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) && defined(UPGRADE_SUPPORT)\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urh;\n  struct MHD_UpgradeResponseHandle *urhn;\n  const bool used_tls = (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS));\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT && UPGRADE_SUPPORT */\n\n#ifdef MHD_USE_THREADS\n  mhd_assert ( (!

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original close_all_connections with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as close_all_connections.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call close_all_connections to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of close_all_connections as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, close_all_connections will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of close_all_connections as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
