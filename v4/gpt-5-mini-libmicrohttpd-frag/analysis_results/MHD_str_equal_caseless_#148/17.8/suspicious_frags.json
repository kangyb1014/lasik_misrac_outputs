  "explanation": "Only operations that modify the parameter variables themselves need investigation under Rule 17.8. The remaining code only reads the parameters or copies their pointees into local variables: dereferencing (*str1), (*str2), assigning to local const char c1 and c2, calling charsequalcaseless(c1, c2), and the return expression (0 == (*str2)) do not modify the pointer parameters and therefore do not violate the rule. These read-only uses need not be investigated further."
