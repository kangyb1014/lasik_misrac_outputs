Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining fragments in the function do not appear to be dead code and therefore need no further investigation for Rule 2.2: the function declaration/parameters are required for linkage and API, the guard if (max < 80) return 0; affects control flow and buffer-safety (removing it would change behavior when max < 80), and the final return 80; conveys the produced length (removing or changing it would alter observable behavior). There is no unreachable code elsewhere in the snippet."
