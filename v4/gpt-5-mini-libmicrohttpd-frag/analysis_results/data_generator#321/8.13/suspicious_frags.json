  "explanation": "Only the unused pointer parameter 'cls' is potentially non-conforming with Rule 8.13: if the function does not modify the object pointed to by cls it should be declared as pointing to a const-qualified type. Other code fragments do not need investigation for this rule: 'buf' is written to (memset and buf[79] = '\\n'), so it must be a non-const char *; 'pos' is an integer (uint64_t), not a pointer; the cast '(void) pos;' simply silences an unused-variable warning and is unrelated to pointer const-qualification; calls to memset and the buffer writes demonstrate that the buffer is intentionally mutable. No other pointer parameters or pointer objects appear in the code that would warrant investigation under Rule 8.13."
