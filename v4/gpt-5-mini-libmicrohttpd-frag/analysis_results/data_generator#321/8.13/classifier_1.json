  "scenario": "The parameter 'void *cls' is not const-qualified even though it is unused and not modified in the function; to conform to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should be declared as 'const void *cls' when possible. Note: 'char *buf' is correctly non-const because the function writes to the buffer. If this prototype must match an external API that requires 'void *', then const-qualification may not be possible and the rule would not apply."
