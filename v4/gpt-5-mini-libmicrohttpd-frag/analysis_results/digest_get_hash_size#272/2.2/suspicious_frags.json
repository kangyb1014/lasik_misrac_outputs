  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function are not flagged because they perform actual, behavior-affecting operations or are legitimately unreachable (which per MISRA note 2 is not considered dead code):\n- The conditional if (...) return ... statements select and return the reported digest size; removing any of these would change observable behavior.\n- The bitmask checks and casts are used to determine the active algorithm and therefore affect control flow and results.\n- The final return 0 provides a defined result for unsupported/wrong input; even if rarely reached, it affects behavior when it is.\n- Preprocessor guards (#ifdef / #endif) control which algorithm support is compiled in; code removed by the preprocessor is not part of the build and thus not subject to this dead-code check.\n- Unreachable code (e.g., code that cannot be executed due to logic or build configuration) is explicitly excluded by the MISRA note and hence was not reported.\nThe listed fragments were included for inspection because they are no-op assertions or an explicit no-op statement that could be executed yet have no effect in some builds (candidate dead code to investigate)."
