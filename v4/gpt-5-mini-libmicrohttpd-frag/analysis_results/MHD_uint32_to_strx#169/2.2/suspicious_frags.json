  "explanation": "The listed fragments should be investigated for possible dead operations (e.g. shifts or decrements executed in iterations where their effect is never used, or return paths that may be unreachable or redundant in some configurations). Other code constructs in the function do not need investigation under MISRA C: initializations of o_pos and digit_pos are initializations (note 3 of the rule) and are not candidates for dead code; declarations of local variables and the ternary expression that forms the character stored into buf are directly used to produce observable output and therefore are not dead; the inline return inside the while loop is part of the control flow that produces the function result and is reachable in normal operation (when the last digit is written), so it is not dead. In short, only the loop bodies and the final fallback return are plausible locations of operations whose removal might not affect behaviour and thus warrant further inspection for Rule 2.2 compliance."
