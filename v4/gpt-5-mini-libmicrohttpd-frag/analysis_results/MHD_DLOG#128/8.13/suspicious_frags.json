  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the function parameters are already const-qualified (const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, const char *format), so they comply with the requirement. The use of va_list and the va_start/va_end calls do not involve pointers to objects that could or should be const-qualified under this rule. The options check (daemon->options & MHD_USE_ERROR_LOG) is an integer operation, not a pointer issue. The only places that could hide non-const pointer usage are the callback function pointer and its context argument accessed on the daemon object, which are reported above for further inspection."
