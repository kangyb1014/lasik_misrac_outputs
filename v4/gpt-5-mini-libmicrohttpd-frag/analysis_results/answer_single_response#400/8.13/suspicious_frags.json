  "explanation": "I did not include fragments that already use const qualification (e.g. \"const char *url\", \"const char *method\", \"const char *version\", \"const char *upload_data\") because they already satisfy Rule 8.13. The calls to strcmp and the use of those const char * parameters do not introduce additional pointer constness issues. The (void) casts used to mark parameters as unused do not affect whether the pointer types should be const-qualified. Other local code (such as the return statements and the call to MHD_queue_response) do not declare new pointer-to-object types that could be made const within this function, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13 and were not included."
