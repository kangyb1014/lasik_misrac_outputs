The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining code constructs should not be investigated for Rule 2.2: the initial check if (NULL == *req_cls) and the subsequent return MHD_YES implement a two-phase handling (affects behavior), the method comparisons using strcmp and the return MHD_NO are functional (they affect connection handling), and the final call to MHD_queue_response obviously affects program behaviour. The declaration/definition of static int marker itself involves static initialization (note: initialization is not treated as an assignment per MISRA and is not a candidate for dead code) and is not flagged here separately. Therefore only the listed fragments warrant further inspection for possible dead/no-op operations; the rest of the function contains executable code that clearly affects program behaviour."
