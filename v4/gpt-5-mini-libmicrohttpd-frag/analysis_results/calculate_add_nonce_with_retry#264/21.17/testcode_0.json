  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe buffer nonce2 is declared as NONCE_STD_LEN(MAX_DIGEST) + 1, but later memcpy(nonce, nonce2, NONCE_STD_LEN(digest_size)) copies NONCE_STD_LEN(digest_size) bytes. If digest_get_size(da) can return a value greater than MAX_DIGEST (so digest_size > MAX_DIGEST), then NONCE_STD_LEN(digest_size) > NONCE_STD_LEN(MAX_DIGEST) + 1 and memcpy will read beyond the bounds of nonce2. Because there is no visible check guaranteeing digest_size <= MAX_DIGEST in the shown code, this is a potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified calculate_add_nonce_with_retry code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/653.txt\".

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original calculate_add_nonce_with_retry with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as calculate_add_nonce_with_retry.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call calculate_add_nonce_with_retry to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, calculate_add_nonce_with_retry will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
