The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments in the function are active operations that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2: the method check (if (0 != strcmp (method, \"GET\")) return MHD_NO;) clearly changes control flow based on input, and the final call return MHD_queue_response (connection, MHD_HTTP_OK, response); produces the response and thus affects observable behaviour. Comments and the function signature are not executable operations. The only no-op executed statements in this function are the explicit (void) casts used to silence unused-parameter warnings; those are the operations whose removal would not change runtime behaviour and thus should be investigated for compliance with the rule."
