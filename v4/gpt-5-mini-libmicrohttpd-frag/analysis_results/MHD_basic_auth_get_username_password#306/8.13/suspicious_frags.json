  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13 because they involve objects that must remain modifiable or otherwise legitimately require non-const pointers: the local 'username' and the allocated '*password' buffers are created and returned to the caller (they must be writable and freed by the caller), so their pointers should not be const-qualified. The calls to free() (free(username); free(info);) operate on allocated storage and thus require non-const pointer types. The conditional checks, assertion lines and diagnostic logging are not relevant to const-qualification of pointer targets. memcpy is used to copy from source buffers (which accept const void*), so those uses themselves are not violations unless the source fields/types are improperly qualified \u2014 the suspicious fragments above identify the places where the source pointers and the surrounding pointer declarations/returns should be checked for appropriate const qualification."
