  "explanation": "Other parts of the function are simple declarations, the function signature, and the return statement which do not perform any string handling or indexed memory accesses that could violate Rule 21.17. The two reported fragments are the only places where data is written into the caller-provided buffer (the call that may write into 'hex' and the explicit NUL write at hex[res]) and therefore are the only locations that need investigation to ensure no out-of-bounds access. No other lines in this snippet perform pointer-based writes or invoke string.h functions."
