  "scenario": "If the prototype of MHD_bin_to_hex is declared to take a non-const pointer (for example: size_t MHD_bin_to_hex(void *bin, size_t size, char *hex)), then passing the local parameter 'bin' of type 'const void *' to it discards the const qualification. That situation violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. (If, however, MHD_bin_to_hex is declared as taking a 'const void *' then there is no violation.)"
