  "explanation": "Only invariant controlling expressions in C statements (if/while/for/do) are relevant to MISRA C:14.3. Preprocessor conditionals (#if/#ifdef) are compile-time and not covered by this rule. All other runtime controlling expressions in the function contain non-constant operands or function calls (e.g. if (0 != WSAStartup(...)), if ((2 != LOBYTE(...)) && ...), if (0 != gcry_control(...)), if (NULL == gcry_check_version(...))) and thus are not invariant. There are no do-while constructs or intentionally infinite loops in this function. Therefore the only fragment that should be investigated for Rule 14.3 is the if (1) block inside the _DEBUG section."
