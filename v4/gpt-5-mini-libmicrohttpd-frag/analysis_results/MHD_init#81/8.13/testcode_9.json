  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThis line can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 when the translation macro/function '_' or the MHD_PANIC parameter are declared to use a non-const pointer (e.g. char *). For example, the common gettext prototype is 'char *gettext(const char *msgid);' (returns non-const char *). If '_' expands to such a function (returning char *) or MHD_PANIC is declared to take 'char *' rather than 'const char *', then a pointer to the string literal is being used without const qualification and Rule 8.13 is violated. To conform, '_' should return 'const char *' and/or MHD_PANIC should accept 'const char *'.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified MHD_init code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/2675.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_init:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_init (void)\n{\n#if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  WSADATA wsd;\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n\n  MHD_set_panic_func (NULL, NULL);\n\n#if defined(MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS)\n  if (0 != WSAStartup (MAKEWORD (2, 2), &wsd))\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Failed to initialize winsock.\\n\"));\n  if ((2 != LOBYTE (wsd.wVersion)) && (2 != HIBYTE (wsd.wVersion)))\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Winsock version 2.2 is not available.\\n\"));\n#endif /* MHD_WINSOCK_SOCKETS */\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n#ifdef MHD_HTTPS_REQUIRE_GCRYPT\n#if GCRYPT_VERSION_NUMBER < 0x010600\n#if GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER <= 0x020b00\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS)\n  if (0 != gcry_control (GCRYCTL_SET_THREAD_CBS,\n                         &gcry_threads_pthread))\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Failed to initialise multithreading in libgcrypt.\\n\"));\n#elif defined(MHD_W32_MUTEX_)\n  if (0 != gcry_control (GCRYCTL_SET_THREAD_CBS,\n                         &gcry_threads_w32))\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"Failed to initialise multithreading in libgcrypt.\\n\"));\n#endif /* defined(MHD_W32_MUTEX_) */\n#endif /* GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER <= 0x020b00 */\n  gcry_check_version (NULL);\n#else\n  if (NULL == gcry_check_version (\"1.6.0\"))\n    MHD_PANIC (_ (\"libgcrypt is too old.

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original MHD_init with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as MHD_init.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call MHD_init to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_init as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, MHD_init will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_init as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
