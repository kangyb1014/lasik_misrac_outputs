  "explanation": "Other code fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the tmp1 array is a local writable buffer (must be non-const to receive data); ptmp2 and ptmp2_size are buffer-management outputs that are intentionally modifiable (so non-const pointer-to-modifiable objects is appropriate); control-flow statements (if/return), numeric assertions on lengths, and enum return values do not affect pointer const-qualification. Only the places where character pointers are read and re-assigned (or passed as input) warrant inspection to ensure pointer types in the surrounding structures and API declarations are const-qualified where possible."
