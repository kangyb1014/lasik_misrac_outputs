  "explanation": "The rest of the function contains active control-flow and data-use operations (method checks, upload-size check, URL comparison, calls to reply/handler functions and the url_len computation) that clearly affect program behaviour: removing or changing them would change which response is returned or when execution returns. The declarations and return statements are used in those control paths, and the string-length and memcmp checks are used to decide which handler to call; these are therefore not candidates for dead-code under Rule 2.2. The three (void) cast statements are no-op operations that are executed solely to silence compiler warnings and whose removal would not change runtime behaviour, so they warrant investigation. The first-time request handling block that uses the address of already_called_marker to mark the request context is a special mechanism whose necessity is not provable from the fragment alone (it may be redundant or misused), so it should also be investigated. No other statements in the function appear to be executed without effect or removable without changing behaviour."
