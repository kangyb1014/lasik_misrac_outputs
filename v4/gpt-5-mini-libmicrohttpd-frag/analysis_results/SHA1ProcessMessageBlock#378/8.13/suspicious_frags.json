  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointer types that could be const-qualified. The only pointer visible in this function is the parameter 'struct SHA1Context *context' and all uses of that pointer are the fragments listed above (reads from message_block and intermediate_hash, and writes back to intermediate_hash and message_block_index). These are the only places where a pointer to data is accessed; local arrays and scalars (K, W, A..E, temp, i) are not pointer declarations and either are already const (K) or are local modifiable objects, so they are not relevant to Rule 8.13. No other pointer variables or pointer-typed expressions appear in this function that would need const qualification, so they are not reported for investigation."
