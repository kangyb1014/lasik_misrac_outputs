  "explanation": "Fragments not listed were judged not suspicious for dead-code under MISRA C Rule 2.2 because they have observable effects on program behaviour (returns, pointer assignments, memory allocation, parse call, or set state flags) or are necessary control flow. Specifically:\n- Declarations of local variables (h_auth_value, bauth) are not executable operations and so are not candidates for dead code.\n- The call to find_auth_rq_header_ and its conditional return are control-flow decisions that affect function output and must be investigated only if they were provably unreachable; they are therefore not flagged here.\n- The allocation via MHD_connection_alloc_memory_ and the subsequent NULL-check return are side-effecting and affect behaviour (memory pool usage / error path), so they are not marked as dead.\n- Assignments to connection->rq.bauth and connection->rq.bauth_tried affect observable program state (returned pointer and retry flag) and are therefore not considered dead without further evidence.\n- The parse_bauth_params call is a non-trivial operation that influences the returned result; it is not dead.\n- Comments and inline notes are not executable and thus not candidates.\nThe listed fragments were chosen because they are plausible places where code might be redundant or have no effect in some build configurations (e.g. an assert that makes a later runtime check unreachable, a memset that may be redundant if the parser fully initializes the struct, and logging blocks that may compile to no-ops). These deserve further investigation to determine whether they constitute dead code in the project configuration."
