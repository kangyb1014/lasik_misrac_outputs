  "explanation": "The fragments selected are the only places in this function that involve allocation, direct use of a string/memory-manipulation function, or passing a pointer/length pair that could be consumed by string.h functions. Other parts of the function do not invoke string handling routines or perform buffer accesses that depend on caller-supplied lengths and therefore do not need investigation under Rule 21.17: - State checks and early returns (mhd_assert, the various if (connection->rq.bauth_tried) / if (MHD_CONNECTION_HEADERS_PROCESSED > connection->state) / return NULL) only test/return values, no string operations. - Assignments to connection->rq.bauth and connection->rq.bauth_tried are simple pointer/boolean stores and do not access object buffers. - The logging calls (MHD_DLOG with string literals) only pass constant format strings and do not perform any string buffer operations here. - The allocation null-check and error-path returns simply handle allocation failure rather than performing string operations. Therefore only the selected fragments need further investigation for possible out-of-bounds access related to <string.h> usage."
