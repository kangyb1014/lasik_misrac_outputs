  "explanation": "I selected fragments where pointer members are accessed only for reading or for pointer arithmetic (c->daemon, c->rq.version, c->read_buffer, c->rq.hdrs.rq_line.rq_tgt, c->rq.url, and use in redirect) because these are the places most likely to permit more const qualification (pointer to const data). I did not mark the following fragments for investigation because they clearly modify the pointed-at object or perform actions where const qualification is not applicable or impossible: assignments to fields (e.g. c->rq.http_ver = ..., c->state = ...), return statements, and calls to helper functions that may mutate the connection state (get_request_line_inner(c), process_request_target(c), transmit_error_response_static(...), process/send functions). Those places either perform writes to the object or invoke functions that may require a non-const pointer, so they are not candidates for Rule 8.13 violations in the local context of this function."
