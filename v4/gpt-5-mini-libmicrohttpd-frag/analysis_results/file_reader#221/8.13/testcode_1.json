  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe local pointer 'response' is declared as 'struct MHD_Response *response = cls;' but in the function it is only used for read-only access (response->fd and response->fd_off). Per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13, the pointer should be const-qualified when possible (e.g. 'const struct MHD_Response *response = cls;' or make the parameter 'const void *cls').\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified file_reader code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/3865.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of file_reader:\n```c\nstatic ssize_t\nfile_reader (void *cls,\n             uint64_t pos,\n             char *buf,\n             size_t max)\n{\n  struct MHD_Response *response = cls;\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n  ssize_t n;\n#else  /* _WIN32 && !__CYGWIN__ */\n  const HANDLE fh = (HANDLE) (uintptr_t) _get_osfhandle (response->fd);\n#endif /* _WIN32 && !__CYGWIN__ */\n  const int64_t offset64 = (int64_t) (pos + response->fd_off);\n\n  if (offset64 < 0)\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR; /* seek to required position is not possible */\n\n#if ! defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)\n  if (max > SSIZE_MAX)\n    max = SSIZE_MAX; /* Clamp to maximum return value. */\n\n#if defined(HAVE_PREAD64)\n  n = pread64 (response->fd, buf, max, offset64);\n#elif defined(HAVE_PREAD)\n  if ( (sizeof(off_t) < sizeof (uint64_t)) &&\n       (offset64 > (uint64_t) INT32_MAX) )\n    return MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_WITH_ERROR; /* Read at required position is not possible. */\n\n  n = pread (response->fd, buf, max, (off_t) offset64);\n#else  /* !

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original file_reader with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as file_reader.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call file_reader to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of file_reader as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, file_reader will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of file_reader as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
