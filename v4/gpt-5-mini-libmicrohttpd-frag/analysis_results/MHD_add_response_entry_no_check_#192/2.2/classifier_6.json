Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ (struct MHD_Response *response,\n                                  enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n                                  const char *header,\n                                  size_t header_len,\n                                  const char *content,\n                                  size_t content_len)\n{\n  char *header_malloced;\n  char *value_malloced;\n\n  mhd_assert (0 != header_len);\n  mhd_assert (0 != content_len);\n  header_malloced = malloc (header_len + 1);\n  if (NULL == header_malloced)\n    return false;\n\n  memcpy (header_malloced, header, header_len);\n  header_malloced[header_len] = 0;\n\n  value_malloced = malloc (content_len + 1);\n  if (NULL != value_malloced)\n  {\n    memcpy (value_malloced, content, content_len);\n    value_malloced[content_len] = 0;\n\n    if (MHD_add_response_entry_no_alloc_ (response, kind,\n                                          header_malloced, header_len,\n                                          value_malloced, content_len))\n      return true; /* Success exit point */\n\n    free (value_malloced);\n  }\n  free (header_malloced);\n\n  return false; /* Failure exit point */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (0 != content_len);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If mhd_assert is a diagnostics macro that expands to nothing in production builds (e.g. defined to ((void)0) when assertions are disabled), the statement mhd_assert(0 != content_len); is executed but has no effect \u2014 removing it would not change program behaviour. In that configuration this is dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, however, mhd_assert performs checks with side\u2011effects such as logging or aborting on failure, then the statement is not dead code and no violation occurs.)"
