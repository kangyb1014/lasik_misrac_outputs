Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The remaining text (comments, closing brace, and surrounding whitespace) does not contain additional operations that could be considered dead code. The conditional checks and string functions shown above implement the function's runtime behaviour; they are the operations that would need review if the function is actually executed. The only items that warrant investigation for potential dead code are: whether this static function is ever referenced (a static, unreferenced function can be dead code) and the explicit cast to (void) for an unused parameter (this is a no-op that may indicate an unused parameter or whole-function redundancy). Other fragments in the snippet are either necessary runtime checks or structural/formatting elements and therefore do not need further investigation for Rule 2.2."
