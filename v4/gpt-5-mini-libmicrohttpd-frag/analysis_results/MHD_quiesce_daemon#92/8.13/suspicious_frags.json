  "explanation": "Fragments not listed do not present cases where a pointer could reasonably be made to point to a const-qualified type. Specifically:\n- The function parameter 'struct MHD_Daemon *daemon' and subsequent uses modify members (e.g. daemon->was_quiesced, worker_pool[i].was_quiesced), so the pointer must not be const.\n- Accesses to daemon->worker_pool and its elements are used for mutation (setting flags, closing descriptors, toggling booleans), so those pointers cannot be const-qualified.\n- Integer and boolean variables (ret, i, flags like listen_socket_in_epoll) are not pointer types and are not relevant to Rule 8.13.\n- The NULL arguments passed to epoll_ctl are null pointer constants; while epoll_ctl takes a pointer parameter, passing NULL is intentional for the DEL operation and does not indicate a missing const-qualification in this source code itself.\n- Macro invocations and condition checks (MHD_D_IS_USING_THREADS_, MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_, MHD_D_IS_USING_EPOLL_) are predicates and do not by themselves indicate pointer const-qualification issues beyond the explicit calls and string literals already listed.\n- Other string/macro usages not listed either are passed through macros where the callee's prototype may already accept const, or they are not pointer-type usages that could be made const without further context.\n\nThe listed suspicious fragments include all places in this function where string literals or pointer arguments are passed to functions/macros (e.g. MHD_itc_activate_, MHD_PANIC, MHD_DLOG) and the two epoll_ctl calls where a pointer parameter is involved; these should be investigated to verify whether the receiving declarations accept const-qualified pointer types as required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
