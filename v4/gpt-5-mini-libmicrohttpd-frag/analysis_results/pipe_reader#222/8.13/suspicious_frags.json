  "explanation": "Only pointers that could and should be const-qualified are reported. The parameter 'buf' is excluded because it is the destination buffer passed to read(), which writes into it, so it must remain a non-const char *. 'pos' is not a pointer and is irrelevant to Rule 8.13. Other expressions (size limits, return-value checks, casts to integer types, preprocessor branches) do not introduce pointers that could be made const and therefore need not be investigated for this rule."
