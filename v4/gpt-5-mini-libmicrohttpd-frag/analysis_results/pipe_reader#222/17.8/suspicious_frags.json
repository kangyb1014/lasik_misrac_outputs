  "explanation": "Only the parameter 'max' is assigned to inside the function (in both the non-WIN32 and _WIN32 branches). Assigning to a function parameter is exactly what MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids. Other parts of the function do not modify parameters and therefore do not need investigation for this rule: (void) pos does not modify 'pos' (it merely marks it as unused); the assignment 'struct MHD_Response *response = cls;' reads 'cls' but does not modify the parameter itself (casting/assigning to a local pointer is allowed); passing 'buf' and the pointer 'response->fd' to read() may result in modification of the objects they point to (which is permitted), but the pointer parameters themselves are not altered; the casts applied in the read() calls do not modify parameters. Therefore only the shown assignments to 'max' require investigation under Rule 17.8."
