  "scenario": "The parameter is declared as void **req_cls but the function never modifies the pointer stored at *req_cls (it only reads it to obtain the Request pointer and then frees the Request). Therefore the pointed-to type (the pointer stored at *req_cls) can be const-qualified. A better declaration would be void * const *req_cls (or, more precisely, struct Request * const *req_cls)."
