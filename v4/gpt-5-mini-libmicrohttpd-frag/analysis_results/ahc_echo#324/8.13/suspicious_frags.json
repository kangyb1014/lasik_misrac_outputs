  "explanation": "I did not mark the const-qualified pointer parameters (const char *url, const char *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data) because they already point to const-qualified types and thus comply with Rule 8.13. Non-pointer objects (static int aptr, int fd, struct stat buf) and uses of url (e.g. strstr, open) are not pointer declarations that the rule addresses. Some pointers returned by library functions (e.g. the response value returned by MHD_create_... and passed to MHD_destroy_response / MHD_queue_response) may be required by the API to be mutable; those API expectations should be confirmed during investigation, which is why related declarations beyond those listed were not included."
