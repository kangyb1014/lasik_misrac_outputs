  "explanation": "I did not include the following fragments because they do not directly suggest use of string.h functions or buffer-length mismatches that need inspection for Rule 21.17: the mhd_assert (! da->hashing); line (it's a runtime/state assertion, not a string operation), the digest_update_with_colon (da); calls (these are likely to append a single known ':' character or use an internal constant length rather than a string.h function), and the function signature/parameter declarations themselves (they merely declare parameters; the actual risk comes from the calls that consume those parameters). The listed fragments are the only places in this function where pointer parameters are forwarded to subroutines without an obvious, verifiable length or where a buffer is passed as an output with no explicit size \u2014 these should be investigated to ensure no use of string.h functions can access beyond object bounds."
