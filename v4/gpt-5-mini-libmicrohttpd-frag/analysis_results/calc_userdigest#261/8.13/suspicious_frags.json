  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns whether pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. The selected fragments show non-const pointer parameters and their uses that may need review: the 'da' parameter (pointer to struct) and the output buffer 'ha1_bin' and all sites where those pointers are accessed or passed. Other fragments were not selected because they are already const-qualified pointers (const char *username, const char *realm, const char *password) or are non-pointer value parameters (const size_t username_len, realm_len) for which Rule 8.13 does not apply. Additionally, the function name, return type, and inline/storage qualifiers do not pertain to pointer const-qualification and so were not included."
