  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calc_userdigest:\n```c\n_MHD_static_inline void\ncalc_userdigest (struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n                 const char *username, const size_t username_len,\n                 const char *realm, const size_t realm_len,\n                 const char *password,\n                 uint8_t *ha1_bin)\n{\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n  digest_update (da, username, username_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update (da, realm, realm_len);\n  digest_update_with_colon (da);\n  digest_update_str (da, password);\n  digest_calc_hash (da, ha1_bin);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If mhd_assert is a typical assertion macro that evaluates '!da->hashing' only in debug builds but expands to ((void)0) (no code) in production (e.g. when NDEBUG is defined), then the assert expression is an operation whose removal would not affect normal program behaviour. In that configuration the check is effectively dead code (it is executed only for diagnostics and has no impact on released behaviour). If, conversely, mhd_assert produces an observable effect in all builds (logging, abort, or other side\u2011effects), then it would not be dead code."
