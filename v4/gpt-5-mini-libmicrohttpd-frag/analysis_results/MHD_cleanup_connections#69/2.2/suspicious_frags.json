  "explanation": "I have flagged operations that assign to fields of the 'pos' structure (and the daemon->at_limit flag) immediately before the object is freed or when the object has already been removed from its data structures. Such assignments are prime candidates for dead code because they modify memory that is shortly freed and not subsequently observed by the program. Other code fragments were not marked because they perform observable side effects or are necessary for correct behaviour: - Resource-destruction calls (MHD_pool_destroy, gnutls_deinit, MHD_destroy_response call itself) free memory or close cryptographic/session resources and must remain. - Socket and FD operations (MHD_socket_close_chk_, epoll_ctl calls, EDLL_remove, DLL_remove) interact with OS or shared data structures and affect program behaviour. - Memory frees (free(pos->addr); free(pos)) release memory and are essential. - Notification callback (daemon->notify_connection) and IP-limit removal (MHD_ip_limit_del) have observable effects outside the function. - Threading/synchronisation operations (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_/unlock, thread join checks and joins) affect concurrency and program correctness. - Assertions (mhd_assert) may be compiled out in some builds but are not simple dead assignments; they document and enforce invariants in debug builds. Therefore these other fragments are not considered dead-code candidates and do not need investigation for Rule 2.2 in the same way as the flagged assignments."
