  "explanation": "Other fragments in the function (the cast and local param initialization, the NULL check, MHD_set_cur_thread_name_(param->name);, arg = param->arg;, free(data); and the early return on NULL) do not themselves perform a function call that could be the same function and therefore are not relevant to detecting direct or indirect self-calls. The only places that can introduce a self-call (direct or indirect recursion) are the function-pointer declaration/assignment and the subsequent invocation, so those are the fragments reported for investigation."
