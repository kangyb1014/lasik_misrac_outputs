  "explanation": "Only the occurrences that involve strlen/form pointer need investigation because Rule 21.17 concerns use of string.h functions that can read beyond object bounds. No other calls to functions from <string.h> (e.g. memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, memmove, memset, memcmp, strspn, etc.) appear in this function. Other lines are calls to library functions (MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response, add_session_cookie) or use of string literals (fprintf) and do not themselves use the <string.h> string-handling functions in the shown code, so they do not need to be investigated for this specific rule here."
