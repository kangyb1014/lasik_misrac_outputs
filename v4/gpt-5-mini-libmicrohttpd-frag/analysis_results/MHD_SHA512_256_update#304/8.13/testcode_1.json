  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThis call violates Rule 8.13 when sha512_256_transform is declared to accept a non-const pointer (e.g. void sha512_256_transform(uint64_t H[], uint8_t *block)). The local variable data has type const uint8_t *; passing it to a parameter of type uint8_t * discards the const qualifier, so the pointer does not point to a const-qualified type as required. (If sha512_256_transform's parameter is already declared as const uint8_t *, then no violation occurs.)\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified MHD_SHA512_256_update code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/485.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_SHA512_256_update:\n```c\nvoid\nMHD_SHA512_256_update (struct Sha512_256Ctx *ctx,\n                       const uint8_t *data,\n                       size_t length)\n{\n  unsigned int bytes_have; /**< Number of bytes in the context buffer */\n  uint64_t count_hi; /**< The high part to be moved to another variable */\n\n  mhd_assert ((data != NULL) || (length == 0));\n\n#ifndef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  if (0 == length)\n    return; /* Shortcut, do nothing */\n#endif /* !

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original MHD_SHA512_256_update with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as MHD_SHA512_256_update.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call MHD_SHA512_256_update to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_SHA512_256_update as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, MHD_SHA512_256_update will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_SHA512_256_update as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
