  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe sequence of redundant casts in the computation of out is executed but has no effect on observable behaviour and therefore constitutes dead code. Specifically: ((uint8_t)((unsigned int)h)) and ((uint8_t)((unsigned int)l)) (and the surrounding repeated uint8_t/unsigned char casts) are unnecessary given the preceding check that h and l are non\u2011negative and the eventual assignment to decoded[w]. Removing these extra casts (or simplifying the expression to something like (unsigned char)((h << 4) | l)) would not change program behaviour. Hence Rule 2.2 is violated.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1618.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ (const char *pct_encoded,\n                              size_t pct_encoded_len,\n                              char *decoded,\n                              size_t buf_size)\n{\n#ifdef MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE\n  bool broken;\n  size_t res;\n\n  res = MHD_str_pct_decode_lenient_n_ (pct_encoded, pct_encoded_len, decoded,\n                                       buf_size, &broken);\n  if (broken)\n    return 0;\n  return res;\n#else  /* !

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_str_pct_decode_strict_n_ as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
