  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Yes. The calls to strlen(key) and strlen(value) are only guarded against NULL pointers, but there is no evidence in this fragment that key and value are guaranteed to point to NUL-terminated objects within their allocated bounds. If either pointer is non-NULL but not terminated within its allocated buffer (for example a pointer into a non-terminated byte array or a truncated/unspecified-length buffer), strlen will read past the object\u2019s bounds and cause an out-of-bounds access. This violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. (Same risk applies to both key and value.)"
