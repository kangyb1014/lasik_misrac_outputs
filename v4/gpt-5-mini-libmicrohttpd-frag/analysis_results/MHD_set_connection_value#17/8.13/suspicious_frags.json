  "explanation": "All other pointer usages in the snippet do not require investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameters 'const char *key' and 'const char *value' are already const-qualified, and their use with strlen (which takes a const char *) is appropriate. There are no other pointer-typed parameters or local pointer variables in the shown code. The enum parameter is not a pointer. Therefore only the listed fragments need further inspection to determine whether the pointed-to types should be const-qualified."
