  "explanation": "The MISRA rule in question concerns use of functions from <string.h>. In this function the only use of a <string.h> routine is the strcmp call shown above, so that call is the only fragment that needs investigation for possible out-of-bounds or non-terminated string accesses. Other lines in the snippet (the loop, the sizeof(user_ids) / sizeof(user_ids[0]) calculation, and the pointer arithmetic entry = user_ids + i) do not invoke any <string.h> functions and therefore are not directly relevant to Rule 21.17. Any potential problems with those lines (for example if user_ids is not actually an array or if the definition of struct UserEntry and its username member are incorrect) are outside the narrow scope of this rule and are not string.h usages themselves, so they are not reported here."
