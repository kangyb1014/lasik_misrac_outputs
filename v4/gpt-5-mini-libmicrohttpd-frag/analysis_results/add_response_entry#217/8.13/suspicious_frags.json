  "explanation": "Only pointers that could reasonably be expected to be const-qualified are candidates for Rule 8.13 review. The two fragments above cover: (a) the function parameter declaration that introduces a non-const pointer to struct MHD_Response, and (b) the call that forwards that pointer (and the const-qualified header/content) to add_response_entry_n \u2014 the callee's parameter types must be inspected to determine whether a const qualification is possible or required. Other parts of the function do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: header and content are already const-qualified (so they comply with the rule), local variables header_len and content_len are non-pointer scalars, and the NULL check on content prevents passing a null content pointer to strlen. There are no other pointer declarations or pointer uses in this fragment that could be made const-qualified."
