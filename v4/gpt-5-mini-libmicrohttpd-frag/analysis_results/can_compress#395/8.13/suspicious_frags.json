  "explanation": "Do not investigate other fragments because they do not present pointers that could/should be const-qualified: the local variables 'const char *ae;' and 'const char *de;' are already const-qualified (so comply with the intent of Rule 8.13). Calls to strcmp and strlen operate on const char * and are used read-only. The remaining code only inspects characters via these const pointers and performs comparisons/indices; it does not store into the pointed-to objects. No other pointer declarations or uses are present in the function that would reasonably be made to point to const-qualified types."
