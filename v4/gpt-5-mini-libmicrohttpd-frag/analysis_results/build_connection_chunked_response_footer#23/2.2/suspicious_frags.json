  "explanation": "All other fragments in the function perform observable operations that affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidates for dead-code under MISRA Rule 2.2: the buffer-size calculation and early returns guard against overruns; the used_size initialization and successive buf[...] assignments actually construct the footer bytes; the memcpy calls copy header and value data into the buffer; the loop over response headers is the only place footer headers are emitted; the bounds checks (new_used_size > buf_size and used_size + 2 > buf_size) and the final update of c->write_buffer_append_offset are necessary to preserve correct runtime behaviour. The listed fragments should be investigated because they are either assertions or alias/temporary constructs that may be compiled out, be redundant, or otherwise have no effect on the compiled program in some build configurations (e.g. when assertion macros are disabled) and thus could constitute dead code or hidden redundancy. No other statements appear to be removable without changing program behaviour."
