  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments (variable declarations, mhd_assert checks such as connection->rp.props.chunked, state and response non-NULL assertions, the for-loop structure, the used_size updates guarded by the checks, and the final update of c->write_buffer_append_offset and its assertion) do not themselves invoke <string.h> functions and are protected by explicit bounds checks or internal assertions. Those constructs therefore do not need further investigation under MISRA C Rule 21.17. The listed fragments are the locations where string handling / buffer writes occur or where size arithmetic that affects those operations is performed, so they should be inspected to ensure memcpy and indexed writes cannot access memory beyond their source or destination object bounds."
