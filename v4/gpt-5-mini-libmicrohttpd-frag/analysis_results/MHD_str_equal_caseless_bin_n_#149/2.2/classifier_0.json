  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_:\n```c\nbool\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_bin_n_ (const char *const str1,\n                               const char *const str2,\n                               size_t len)\n{\n  size_t i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)\n  {\n    const char c1 = str1[i];\n    const char c2 = str2[i];\n    if (charsequalcaseless (c1, c2))\n      continue;\n    else\n      return 0;\n  }\n  return ! 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\ncontinue;\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The 'continue;' statement inside the for-loop is executed whenever charsequalcaseless(c1, c2) is true. Removing that single 'continue;' does not change the program behavior because control simply reaches the end of the loop body and proceeds to the next iteration in either case. Since the operation is executed but its removal would not affect behavior, it is dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
