Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The transmit_error_response_static(...) call is an active error-path operation whose removal would clearly change program behaviour, so it is not dead and does not need investigation. Comments and the closing brace are not executable and thus not candidates. The two explicit (void) casts and the use of the mhd_assert macro (and the function being declared static) are included above because they may be no-op operations (or render the whole function unused) depending on build/configuration; these require investigation to determine whether they constitute dead code under Rule 2.2."
