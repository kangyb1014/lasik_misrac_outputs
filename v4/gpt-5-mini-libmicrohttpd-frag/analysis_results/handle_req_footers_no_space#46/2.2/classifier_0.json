Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of handle_req_footers_no_space:\n```c\nstatic void\nhandle_req_footers_no_space (struct MHD_Connection *c,\n                             const char *add_footer,\n                             size_t add_footer_size)\n{\n  (void) add_footer; (void) add_footer_size; /* Unused */\n  mhd_assert (c->rq.have_chunked_upload);\n\n  /* Footers should be optional */\n  transmit_error_response_static (c,\n                                  MHD_HTTP_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE,\n                                  ERR_MSG_REQUEST_FOOTER_TOO_BIG);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (c->rq.have_chunked_upload);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "If mhd_assert is an assertion macro that is compiled out in non-debug builds (e.g. expands to ((void)0) when NDEBUG is set), the statement mhd_assert(c->rq.have_chunked_upload); is an executed no-op in some builds and its presence or removal does not affect program behaviour \u2014 this constitutes dead code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, however, mhd_assert performs runtime actions with observable side\u2011effects such as logging or termination, then it would not be dead code.)"
