  "explanation": "I scanned the function for any statements that assign to or otherwise modify the function parameters. The only modifications of parameters are the pointer parameter 'data' (the pointer variable is incremented) and the scalar parameter 'length' (decremented) \u2014 these are reported above because MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 prohibits modifying function parameters (the pointer itself must not be changed). Other statements that mutate ctx->count or write through ctx->buffer modify the objects pointed to by the pointer parameter 'ctx', not the parameter variable itself; that is permitted by the rule and therefore those fragments were not flagged. Similarly, calls to memcpy, sha256_transform, the assert, local variable assignments (bytes_have, bytes_left), loop and conditional structures do not modify function parameters and are not suspicious with respect to Rule 17.8."
