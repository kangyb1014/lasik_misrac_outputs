  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nIf mhd_assert is enabled at runtime (i.e. it expands to code that performs the check) and the program logic guarantees c->connection_timeout_ms (timeout) is never zero (for example it is initialized to a non\u2011zero value and never modified to zero elsewhere), then the assertion will always evaluate true, will always execute, and its removal would not affect program behaviour. In that situation the statement is dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Note: if mhd_assert is compiled out (expands to nothing) then it is not executed and does not constitute dead code.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified connection_get_wait code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/3948.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of connection_get_wait:\n```c\nstatic uint64_t\nconnection_get_wait (struct MHD_Connection *c)\n{\n  const uint64_t now = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\n  const uint64_t since_actv = now - c->last_activity;\n  const uint64_t timeout = c->connection_timeout_ms;\n  uint64_t mseconds_left;\n\n  mhd_assert (0 != timeout);\n  /* Keep the next lines in sync with #connection_check_timedout() to avoid\n   * undesired side-effects like busy-waiting. */\n  if (timeout < since_actv)\n  {\n    if (UINT64_MAX / 2 < since_actv)\n    {\n      const uint64_t jump_back = c->last_activity - now;\n      /* Very unlikely that it is more than quarter-million years pause.\n       * More likely that system clock jumps back. */\n      if (5000 >= jump_back)\n      { /* Jump back is less than 5 seconds, try to recover. */\n        return 100; /* Set wait time to 0.1 seconds */\n      }\n      /* Too large jump back */\n    }\n    return 0; /* Connection has timed out */\n  }\n  else if (since_actv == timeout)\n  {\n    /* Exact match for timeout and time from last activity.\n     * Maybe this is just a precise match or this happens because the timer\n     * resolution is too low.\n     * Set wait time to 0.1 seconds to avoid busy-waiting with low\n     * timer resolution as connection is not timed-out yet. */\n    return 100;\n  }\n  mseconds_left = timeout - since_actv;\n\n  return mseconds_left;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n\n<instruction>\n\nPlease provide the modified connection_get_wait code.\n\nThe information below explains how I\u2019ll use the function you provide. Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original connection_get_wait with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as connection_get_wait.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call connection_get_wait to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of connection_get_wait as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, connection_get_wait will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of connection_get_wait as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
