  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nIf mhd_assert is implemented as a diagnostic/assertion macro that is compiled out or defined as a no-op in production builds (for example when NDEBUG is set), then the statement mhd_assert(NULL == daemon->worker_pool); only reads a field (no side-effects) and its removal would not affect program behaviour. In that configuration the assertion is dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. (If, however, mhd_assert performs observable actions such as logging or aborting on failure, it would not be dead code.)\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified internal_add_connection code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/4258.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario.

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original internal_add_connection with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as internal_add_connection.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call internal_add_connection to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of internal_add_connection as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, internal_add_connection will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of internal_add_connection as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
