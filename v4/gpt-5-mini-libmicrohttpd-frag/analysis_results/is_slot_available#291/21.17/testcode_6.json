  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe call memcmp(nn->nonce, new_nonce, new_nonce_len) can read new_nonce_len bytes from both nn->nonce and new_nonce without a guaranteed runtime check that new_nonce_len <= sizeof(nn->nonce) and that new_nonce points to at least new_nonce_len bytes. The function only uses mhd_assert to bound new_nonce_len, but assertions may be compiled out and do not prevent a real out\u2011of\u2011bounds access at runtime. Example violating scenario: caller supplies new_nonce_len greater than the actual size of nn->nonce (or greater than the allocated length of new_nonce) \u2014 memcmp then reads past the buffer(s), violating Rule 21.17.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified is_slot_available code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/963.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_slot_available:\n```c\nstatic bool\nis_slot_available (const struct MHD_NonceNc *const nn,\n                   const uint64_t now,\n                   const char *const new_nonce,\n                   size_t new_nonce_len)\n{\n  uint64_t timestamp;\n  bool timestamp_valid;\n  mhd_assert (new_nonce_len <= NONCE_STD_LEN (MAX_DIGEST));\n  mhd_assert (NONCE_STD_LEN (MAX_DIGEST) <= MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH);\n  if (0 == nn->nonce[0])\n    return true; /* The slot is empty */\n\n  if (0 == memcmp (nn->nonce, new_nonce, new_nonce_len))\n  {\n    /* The slot has the same nonce already.

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original is_slot_available with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as is_slot_available.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call is_slot_available to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of is_slot_available as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, is_slot_available will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of is_slot_available as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
