  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 2.2.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe assertion compares two macro-defined constants (NONCE_STD_LEN(MAX_DIGEST) and MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH). Because both sides are compile-time constants the condition is always true and the runtime assertion has no effect \u2014 removing it would not change program behaviour. Therefore this executed check is dead code. (Replace with a compile-time check such as _Static_assert or remove it.)\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified is_slot_available code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/968.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of is_slot_available:\n```c\nstatic bool\nis_slot_available (const struct MHD_NonceNc *const nn,\n                   const uint64_t now,\n                   const char *const new_nonce,\n                   size_t new_nonce_len)\n{\n  uint64_t timestamp;\n  bool timestamp_valid;\n  mhd_assert (new_nonce_len <= NONCE_STD_LEN (MAX_DIGEST));\n  mhd_assert (NONCE_STD_LEN (MAX_DIGEST) <= MAX_DIGEST_NONCE_LENGTH);\n  if (0 == nn->nonce[0])\n    return true; /* The slot is empty */\n\n  if (0 == memcmp (nn->nonce, new_nonce, new_nonce_len))\n  {\n    /* The slot has the same nonce already. This nonce cannot be registered\n     * again as it would just clear 'nc' usage history. */\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (0 != nn->nc)\n    return true; /* Client already used the nonce in this slot at least\n                    one time, re-use the slot */\n\n  /* The nonce must be zero-terminated */\n  mhd_assert (0 == nn->nonce[sizeof(nn->nonce) - 1]);\n  if (0 != nn->nonce[sizeof(nn->nonce) - 1])\n    return true; /* Wrong nonce format in the slot */\n\n  timestamp_valid = get_nonce_timestamp (nn->nonce, 0, &timestamp);\n  mhd_assert (timestamp_valid);\n  if (! timestamp_valid)\n    return true; /* Invalid timestamp in nonce-nc, should not be possible */\n\n  if ((REUSE_TIMEOUT * 1000) < TRIM_TO_TIMESTAMP (now - timestamp))\n    return true;\n\n  return false;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n\n<instruction>\n\nPlease provide the modified is_slot_available code.\n\nThe information below explains how I\u2019ll use the function you provide. Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original is_slot_available with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as is_slot_available.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call is_slot_available to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of is_slot_available as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, is_slot_available will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of is_slot_available as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
