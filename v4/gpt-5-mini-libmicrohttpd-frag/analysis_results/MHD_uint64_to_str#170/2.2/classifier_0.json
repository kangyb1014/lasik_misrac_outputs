The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_uint64_to_str:\n```c\nsize_t\nMHD_uint64_to_str (uint64_t val,\n                   char *buf,\n                   size_t buf_size)\n{\n  char *chr;  /**< pointer to the current printed digit */\n  /* The biggest printable number is 18446744073709551615 */\n  uint64_t divisor = UINT64_C (10000000000000000000);\n  int digit;\n\n  chr = buf;\n  digit = (int) (val / divisor);\n  mhd_assert (digit < 10);\n\n  /* Do not print leading zeros */\n  while ((0 == digit) && (1 < divisor))\n  {\n    divisor /= 10;\n    digit = (int) (val / divisor);\n    mhd_assert (digit < 10);\n  }\n\n  while (0 != buf_size)\n  {\n    *chr = (char) ((char) digit + '0');\n    chr++;\n    buf_size--;\n    if (1 == divisor)\n      return (size_t) (chr - buf);\n    val %= divisor;\n    divisor /= 10;\n    digit = (int) (val / divisor);\n    mhd_assert (digit < 10);\n  }\n  return 0; /* The buffer is too small */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmhd_assert (digit < 10);\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "If mhd_assert expands to an actual runtime check (e.g. a function or code that is executed in production) then the assertion is provably always true at that point (digit is derived from val/divisor where divisor = 10^19 and uint64_t val \u2264 18446744073709551615), so the check has no effect on program behaviour. Because the operation is executed but its removal would not affect behaviour, this constitutes dead code and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2."
