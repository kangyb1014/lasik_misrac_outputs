  "explanation": "The MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 forbids modifying function parameters. The fragments selected explicitly modify parameters: buf_size-- modifies the size_t parameter buf_size, and val %= divisor modifies the uint64_t parameter val. Other lines do not modify parameters and thus need not be investigated: assigning chr = buf; only copies the pointer value into a local variable (does not modify the parameter buf itself); incrementing chr (chr++) and writing to *chr modify a local pointer and the object pointed-to (allowed per the rule); casts and computes (e.g., digit = (int)(val / divisor)) only read parameters; returns using buf (chr - buf) do not modify parameters. Therefore no other fragments appear to violate Rule 17.8."
