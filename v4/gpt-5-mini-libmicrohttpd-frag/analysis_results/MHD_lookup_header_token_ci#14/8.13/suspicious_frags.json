  "explanation": "The function parameters that are relevant to const qualification (connection, header, token) are already declared const and the initial NULL/empty checks and numeric comparisons (header_len == pos->header_size, tests of pos->kind) do not indicate missing const qualifications. The pointer arithmetic/loop control and return statements are normal control-flow constructs and do not themselves suggest additional constness requirements. Therefore only uses where data obtained via the const-qualified connection is assigned to or used through non-const pointers (the declarations/assignments and subsequent uses of pos and its header/value members) need investigation for possible missing const qualification."
