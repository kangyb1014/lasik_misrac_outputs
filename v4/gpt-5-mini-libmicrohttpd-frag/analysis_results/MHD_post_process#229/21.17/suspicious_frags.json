  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not perform string handling or call functions from <string.h> directly and are simple sanity checks: the checks for post_data_len == 0 and pp == NULL and the final return statement do not themselves risk out-of-bounds access by standard string functions. Also, MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_ is applied to compile-time string constants (so its use is not an out-of-bounds risk here). The only places in this function that could lead to string handling that needs investigation are the calls to MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ (which read pp->encoding) and the subsequent calls to post_process_urlencoded/post_process_multipart (which receive post_data and post_data_len). These fragments are reported above so that other agents can inspect the implementations of those functions/macros to ensure no accesses beyond object bounds occur."
