Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The fragments above are flagged for investigation because they are either assertions or macro calls that are commonly compiled out or convert to no-ops in different build configurations (and thus may represent dead code in some builds), or they handle very rare overflow/edge cases whose reachability should be verified. The remaining statements in the function (calculation of ret, updating pool->end, the assignment *required_bytes = 0 on success, and the final return ret) implement the core allocation behavior and change program state observed by callers; removing them would change program behaviour, so they are not considered dead and do not need investigation for Rule 2.2."
