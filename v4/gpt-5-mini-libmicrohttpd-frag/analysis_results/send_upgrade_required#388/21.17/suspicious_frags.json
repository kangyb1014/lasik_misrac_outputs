  "explanation": "Only the use of strlen is a direct invocation of a <string.h> function in this snippet and therefore must be investigated to ensure it cannot read past the object referred to by UPGRADE_REQUIRED_PAGE. The other function calls in the function body (MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response and the header/value macros passed to them) do not themselves invoke <string.h> string-handling functions in this snippet and therefore are not directly relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. Investigation should focus on the strlen call and the object UPGRADE_REQUIRED_PAGE (its definition, storage size, and null-termination)."
