The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_send_iovec_:\n```c\nssize_t\nMHD_send_iovec_ (struct MHD_Connection *connection,\n                 struct MHD_iovec_track_ *const r_iov,\n                 bool push_data)\n{\n#ifdef MHD_VECT_SEND\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) || \\\n  defined(_MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED)\n  bool use_iov_send = true;\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT || _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n#endif /* MHD_VECT_SEND */\n\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->rp.resp_iov.iov);\n  mhd_assert (NULL != connection->rp.response->data_iov);\n  mhd_assert (connection->rp.resp_iov.cnt > connection->rp.resp_iov.sent);\n#ifdef MHD_VECT_SEND\n#if defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) || \\\n  defined(_MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED)\n#ifdef HTTPS_SUPPORT\n  use_iov_send = use_iov_send &&\n                 (0 == (connection->daemon->options & MHD_USE_TLS));\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT */\n#ifdef _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED\n  use_iov_send = use_iov_send && (connection->daemon->sigpipe_blocked ||\n                                  connection->sk_spipe_suppress);\n#endif /* _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n  if (use_iov_send)\n#endif /* HTTPS_SUPPORT || _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n  return send_iov_nontls (connection, r_iov, push_data);\n#endif /* MHD_VECT_SEND */\n\n#if ! defined(MHD_VECT_SEND) || defined(HTTPS_SUPPORT) || \\\n  defined(_MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED)\n  return send_iov_emu (connection, r_iov, push_data);\n#endif /* !MHD_VECT_SEND || HTTPS_SUPPORT\n          || _MHD_VECT_SEND_NEEDS_SPIPE_SUPPRESSED */\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n\n<instruction>\n\nPlease provide the modified MHD_send_iovec_ code.\n\nThe information below explains how I\u2019ll use the function you provide. Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original MHD_send_iovec_ with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as MHD_send_iovec_.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call MHD_send_iovec_ to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_send_iovec_ as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, MHD_send_iovec_ will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_send_iovec_ as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
