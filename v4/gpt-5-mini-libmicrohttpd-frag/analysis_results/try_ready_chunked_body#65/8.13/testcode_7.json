  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe code passes a translated string literal _( \"Closing connection (application error generating response).\" ) to CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR. If either the _ translation macro or the CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR macro/function expects or produces a non-const char * (which is common for legacy gettext APIs), then a pointer to a non-const char is being used to refer to an immutable string literal. That is a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Remedy: ensure the translation function and the CONNECTION_CLOSE_ERROR API use const char * (or cast appropriately) so the pointer points to a const-qualified type.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified try_ready_chunked_body code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1605.txt\".

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original try_ready_chunked_body with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as try_ready_chunked_body.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call try_ready_chunked_body to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of try_ready_chunked_body as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, try_ready_chunked_body will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of try_ready_chunked_body as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
