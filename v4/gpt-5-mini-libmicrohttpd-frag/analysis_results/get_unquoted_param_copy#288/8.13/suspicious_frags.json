  "explanation": "I did not mark other fragments because they appear to require a mutable (non-const) pointer by design: tmp1 is a destination buffer written into, ptmp2 is a pointer-to-pointer used to manage/return a (possibly dynamic) buffer and thus must be modifiable, ptmp2_size and unquoted are output parameters that are modified by the function and therefore cannot be const-qualified. The function parameter 'const struct MHD_RqDAuthParam *param' already makes the struct itself const; the suspicious uses above access the member param->value.str only for read operations, so the member's pointee type should be investigated to determine whether it ought to be const-qualified (MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13)."
