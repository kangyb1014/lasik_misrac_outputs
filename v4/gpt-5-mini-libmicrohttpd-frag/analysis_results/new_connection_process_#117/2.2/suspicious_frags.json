  "explanation": "The fragments reported above are simple no-op/ redundant constructs or trivially constant condition handling that warrant inspection for potential dead-code per MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Other parts of the function were not reported because they perform observable state changes or interactions that can affect program behaviour and therefore are not candidate dead code:\n- Resource allocation/cleanup and related error handling (MHD_pool_create, MHD_pool_destroy, gnutls_deinit, MHD_socket_close_chk_, free(connection), free(connection->addr), MHD_ip_limit_del) \u2014 removing these would change program behaviour and resource semantics.\n- Connection/accounting state changes (daemon->connections++, DLL_insert, XDLL_insert, XDLL_remove, DLL_remove, daemon->connections--) \u2014 these maintain critical runtime state.\n- Synchronization operations (MHD_mutex_lock_chk_, MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_) \u2014 affect concurrency behaviour.\n- Notifications and callbacks (daemon->notify_connection calls, MHD_connection_set_initial_state_) \u2014 observable side effects to clients.\n- Thread and event-control operations (MHD_create_named_thread_, epoll_ctl, EDLL_insert, epoll-related state assignments) \u2014 affect program flow and I/O readiness handling.\n- Log calls and errno assignments that are protected by feature macros (HAVE_MESSAGES, EAGAIN, ENOMEM, ENFILE etc.) or executed as part of error-path reporting \u2014 these serve as diagnostics and error signalling.\n- Preprocessor-guarded blocks (#ifdef / #endif) are build-time conditional; code excluded by the preprocessor is not executed and so is not a runtime dead-code issue in the sense of this rule.\n- Assertions (mhd_assert) are implementation-dependent; if they expand to a no-op in production builds that is a compile-time choice, not runtime dead code here.\n- Early returns on success paths are deliberate control-flow and not dead code \u2014 the cleanup path that follows is still reachable for failure cases.\n\nThe listed suspicious fragments should be investigated to confirm whether they are intentionally present (for example to silence compiler warnings or to provide deterministic errno values) or whether they constitute dead operations that should be removed or refactored."
