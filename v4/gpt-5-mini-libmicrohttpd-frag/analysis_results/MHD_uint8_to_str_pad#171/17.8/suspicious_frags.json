  "explanation": "Only modifications of function parameters are relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8. The three listed fragments are explicit assignments/updates to the value parameters (val and min_digits) and therefore must be investigated. Other code fragments do not modify parameters: reads of parameters (e.g. digit = val / 100; mhd_assert(3 >= min_digits); comparisons) are harmless for this rule; writes to buf (e.g. buf[pos++] = ...) modify the object pointed to by the pointer parameter which is permitted by the rule, and the pointer variable buf itself is never reassigned; local variables (pos, digit) are modified but they are not parameters. No other parameter assignments or pointer reassignments occur in the function, so no further fragments need investigation for Rule 17.8."
