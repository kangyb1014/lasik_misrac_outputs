  "scenario": "compress_buf takes &size and &buf and may modify them; the code then blindly does memcpy(mem, buf, size) without verifying that the resulting size does not exceed the capacity of mem or the allocated size of buf. For example, if the caller passed mem with capacity 1024 and initial size==1024 but compress_buf (by design or by bug) sets size to 2048 or returns a buf that was allocated with only 1024 bytes, the memcpy(mem, buf, size) will write beyond mem or read beyond buf. Because there is no check that the updated size fits the mem buffer or that buf actually contains at least size bytes, this can lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses and thus violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
