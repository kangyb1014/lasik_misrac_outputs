Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "All other statements participate in the function's observable behaviour (control-flow decisions, header lookups, protocol validation, response creation/queueing, memory management and returns). Removing them would change program behaviour (e.g. change return paths, skip protocol checks, leak or double-free resources, or prevent websocket handshake). Declarations are used later (e.g. res, ws_* variables) or are part of required API interactions (the *req_cls handling with (void *)1 and subsequent NULL reset is necessary for the multi-call request handling). There is no unreachable code in the fragment; therefore the only operations that are pure no-op expressions (executed but having no effect on behaviour) are the four (void) parameter casts listed above and they warrant investigation for dead-code compliance."
