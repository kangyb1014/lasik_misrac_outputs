  "explanation": "Fragments not listed above were inspected and are unlikely candidates for dead code because they either: - invoke functions that have observable side effects (e.g. MHD_itc_clear_, MHD_accept_connection, MHD_resume_connection, MHD_connection_finish_forward_, call_handlers, new_connections_list_process_, process_urh, MHD_cleanup_connections), so removing them would change runtime behaviour. - perform I/O / socket state checks or mutate state used later (e.g. FD_ISSET checks, setting/using r_ready, w_ready, has_err when FD checks are possible), so removal would alter connection handling. - are control-flow constructs (loops, if/else) that determine which handlers run; removing them would affect sequencing/timing. - are conditional compile blocks tied to HTTPS/UPGRADE support; those blocks are present only when features are enabled and contain code with side effects. The listed fragments were selected because they are simple no-op expression-statements or assignments/initialisations whose removal is unlikely to affect program behaviour (for example the repeated \u201c(void) fd_setsize;\u201d lines used solely to suppress compiler warnings, an initializer that may be overwritten unconditionally, discarded-return call, or assignments the comments indicate may be no-op in some configurations). If you want, I can further narrow or expand this list by analysing macro definitions (mhd_assert, MHD_SCKT_FD_FITS_FDSET_SETSIZE_, _MHD_DROP_CONST, MHD_ITC_IS_VALID_, etc.) to determine whether some of the above are provably dead in the current build configuration."
