  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "The only potential violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 in this function is the single for-statement and the variables it relies on. There are no other for-loops in the function to inspect, and the remaining code (open/close calls, error handling, the Windows crypto branch and other statements) does not contain for-loop clauses or affect the well-formedness of a for statement per Rule 14.2; therefore they do not need investigation for this specific rule. The listed fragments include the loop header plus the declaration and assignment of the variables involved so reviewers can assess clause 1\u20133 and whether any loop counter or objects used in the clauses are modified in the loop body."
