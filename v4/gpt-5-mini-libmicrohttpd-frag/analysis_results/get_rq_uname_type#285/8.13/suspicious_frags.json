  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 because they do not involve pointers that could or should be const-qualified: the function parameter is already a pointer to a const-qualified struct (const struct MHD_RqDAuth *params), the uses of params->username_ext.value.len and boolean members (params->username_ext.quoted, params->userhash) are value reads rather than pointer dereferences, and the return expressions and enum handling do not involve non-const pointer types. The only places where pointer members are read (the three conditions above checking value.str) may indicate underlying pointer types that should be const-qualified and therefore are flagged for investigation; all other code paths do not present pointer-to-non-const concerns for Rule 8.13."
