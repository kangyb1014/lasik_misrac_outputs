  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: the parameter 'const char *uri' is already const-qualified and therefore conforms; the local pointer 'struct timeval *tv' must remain non-const because it is passed to gettimeofday which writes into the pointed object; the allocation via malloc returns writable memory that is subsequently initialized, so the pointer to that memory is appropriately non-const; the (void) uri and (void) cls lines only mark unused parameters and do not affect qualification of the pointed-to type. Therefore the only candidate needing review for unnecessary lack of const qualification is the 'cls' parameter."
