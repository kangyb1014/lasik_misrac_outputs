  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 21.17.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nMHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ is called with n = MHD_STATICSTR_LEN_(\"Content-disposition: \") and buf pointing to the post-processor buffer. The code only guarantees newline < pp->buffer_size (and null-terminates at buf[newline]) but does not ensure that pp->buffer_size >= n. If MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ is implemented using a <string.h> routine that reads up to n bytes (e.g. memcmp/strncasecmp), and pp->buffer_size is smaller than the static string length, the call can read past the bounds of the object referenced by buf, violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified process_multipart_headers code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/1423.txt\".

Please use it as a reference when generating code.\n1. Replacement\n  - I will parse your function and replace the original process_multipart_headers with it.\n  - Your function must have the exact same signature as process_multipart_headers.\n  - It must be a complete, self-contained definition; (no omissions, placeholders (e.g., \"...\"), or comments indicating skipped/omitted logic.)\n2. Logging / reachability\n  - I will run a test suite that is guaranteed to call process_multipart_headers to check logs.\n  - Your function MUST preserve the original logic of process_multipart_headers as much as possible.\n  - The log output must not be empty. Even if you are verifying dead code, process_multipart_headers will be reached; insert a minimal probe/log to demonstrate that the target function was entered.\n3. Coverage\n  - I will run the same test suite to measure coverage.\n  - Test outcomes must match those of the original code.\n  - If reproducing the rule violation necessarily causes a crash (e.g., the violation inherently triggers a crash), that is acceptable; otherwise, your function should not crash under the existing test suite so coverage can be measured.\n4. Test code constraints\n  - The test code MUST preserve the original logic of process_multipart_headers as much as possible.\n  - DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n  - The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n  - The test code MUST include line breaks.\n  - You MUST NOT define the main function.\n  - You MUST NOT define macros.\n  - You MUST NOT REDEFINE any existing identifiers, such as macros, static/global variables, or functions.\n  - Do not break string literals or include stray/unmatched double quotes; the code must parse cleanly with no quote-related errors.\n\nThese are common mistakes of generated codes. Do not make these mistakes:\n- Redefining existing functions, variables, types, or macros.\n- Broken string literals or unmatched quotes.\n- Invoking undeclared function.\n- Using undeclared member in a struct.\n- Invoking functions with wrong parameter type.\n\n</instruction>\n",
