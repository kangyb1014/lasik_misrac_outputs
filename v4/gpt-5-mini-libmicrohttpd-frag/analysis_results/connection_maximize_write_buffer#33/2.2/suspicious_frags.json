  "explanation": "I flagged the assertion statements and the offsets-reset block for investigation. Assertions are commonly compiled out or expanded differently depending on build configuration; any expression or function call used only inside assertions (e.g. MHD_pool_is_resizable_inplace) can become effectively dead in some builds or may hide dead-code situations. The offsets-reset branch may be an optimization (resetting non-zero but equal offsets to zero) whose removal might not affect functional behaviour but could affect timing/state \u2014 it therefore merits review for dead-code status.\n\nOther fragments were not flagged because they perform observable work essential to program behaviour: the free_size calculation, the conditional if (0 != free_size) that gates reallocation, the call to MHD_pool_reallocate and subsequent assignments to c->write_buffer and c->write_buffer_size, the aliasing of connection to c, the declarations and uses of new_size/new_buf, and the final return expression all directly affect runtime state or outputs and cannot be considered dead without changing program behaviour. These parts should not be considered dead code and therefore were not included for investigation."
