  "explanation": "Only the shown fragments can result in out-of-bounds accesses related to the <string.h> functions or to buffer writes that depend on sizes. The rest of the function (digest_init_one_time, digest_deinit, digest_ext_error check, return handling, local enum/struct usage, and simple assignments) does not directly use any <string.h> routines and does not perform pointer dereferences or buffer writes that could invoke the Rule 21.17 concern. The listed fragments cover: (a) the strlen() calls which may be invoked on NULL or non-terminated char pointers, (b) the call to calc_userdigest which receives those lengths and the destination buffer and may internally call string.h functions, and (c) the digest_get_size() vs bin_buf_size check which is intended to prevent overflow of userdigest_bin (this check itself should be reviewed to ensure it correctly prevents out-of-bounds writes). No other code lines in the function use standard string.h routines or perform buffer accesses relevant to Rule 21.17, so they do not require investigation for this rule."
