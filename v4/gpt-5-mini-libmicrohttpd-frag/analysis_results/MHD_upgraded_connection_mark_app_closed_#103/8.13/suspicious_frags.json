  "explanation": "I did not mark the other fragments because they clearly write to the pointee or otherwise require a mutable pointee, so qualifying the pointee const would be incorrect: - The function parameter 'struct MHD_Connection *connection' is used to modify fields (connection->urh->was_closed = true; connection->resuming = true), so the pointee cannot be const. - The accesses that set daemon state (daemon->resuming = true) or modify connection/urh fields clearly mutate the pointee and thus should not be const-qualified. - The mutex operations MHD_mutex_lock_chk_(&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex) and MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(&daemon->cleanup_connection_mutex) operate on a mutable mutex object and cannot take a pointer-to-const. - The assertions (mhd_assert (NULL != connection->urh); mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->worker_pool); mhd_assert (0 != (daemon->options & MHD_TEST_ALLOW_SUSPEND_RESUME));) only read values; the pointees involved here are either already being used mutably elsewhere or are simple reads that do not indicate a missed const qualification. The three fragments I selected should be investigated: the local daemon pointer declaration (could the pointee be const-qualified in some contexts?) and the uses of daemon->itc and the string literal \"r\" (ensure the itc API and the second parameter are declared to accept const-qualified pointers where appropriate)."
