  "explanation": "I replaced the const declaration with a mutable instance of the module record to avoid constness issues. By doing so, the code simulates a typical usage scenario where the module structure is modifiable, which aligns with the original assumption that 'module' is a non-const pointer. This fix ensures the code compiles successfully and preserves the intended logic."
