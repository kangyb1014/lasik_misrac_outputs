  "explanation": "I provided a sample implementation of the OS_ModuleLoad function using strcmp for string comparison, and included test cases that demonstrate its usage. This ensures the code is self-contained, compiles successfully, and adheres to the constraints of not defining main or macros, not containing mocks, and preserving the original logic as much as possible."
