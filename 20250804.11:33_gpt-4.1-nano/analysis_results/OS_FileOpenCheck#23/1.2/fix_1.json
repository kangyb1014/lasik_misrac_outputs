  "explanation": "I added necessary header includes for standard I/O and boolean types. Then, I implemented the OS_FileOpenCheck function that tries to open the file in read mode, returns true if successful, false otherwise. I also included a simple test function demonstrating usage. This ensures the code compiles and runs as intended, adhering to the original logic of checking if a file can be opened."
