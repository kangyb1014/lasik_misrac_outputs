  "explanation": "I fixed the code by changing the filename string to use double quotes to ensure proper syntax, since single quotes are used for characters. Additionally, I added escape sequences for the newline character in the fprintf statement to ensure correct formatting. These changes make the code compile successfully while preserving the original logic."
