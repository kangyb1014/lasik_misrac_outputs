  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_ModuleLoad_Static code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/195.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_ModuleLoad_Static as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_ModuleLoad_Static:\n```c\nint32 OS_ModuleLoad_Static(const char *ModuleName)\n{\n    int32                      return_code = OS_ERR_NAME_NOT_FOUND;\n    OS_static_symbol_record_t *StaticSym   = OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE;\n\n    while (StaticSym != NULL)\n    {\n        if (StaticSym->Name == NULL)\n        {\n            /* end of list  */\n            break;\n        }\n        if (StaticSym->Module != NULL && strcmp(StaticSym->Module, ModuleName) == 0)\n        {\n            /* found matching module name */\n            return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n            break;\n        }\n\n        ++StaticSym;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_ModuleLoad_Static code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function OS_ModuleLoad_Static takes a 'const char *ModuleName' parameter, which implies that it should not modify the string pointed to. The function compares this string to other strings using strcmp, which does not modify the strings. However, if the function or any caller modifies the string through this pointer, it would violate the intended constancy. Also, the function itself does not modify the data pointed to, maintaining the 'const' correctness, but the rule emphasizes that pointers should point to 'const' types whenever possible; in this case, the pointer is already 'const char *', which is correct.",
