Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "The symbols needed include 'OS_static_symbol_record_t' to understand the structure of StaticSym, 'OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE' as the source of the symbol list, and 'strcmp' to analyze string comparisons which affect control flow. These symbols are essential to determine if parts of the code are unreachable or dead, thereby assessing adherence to the MISRA C rule."
