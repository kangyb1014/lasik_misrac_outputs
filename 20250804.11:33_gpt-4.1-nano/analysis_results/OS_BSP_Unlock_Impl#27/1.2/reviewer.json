  "explanation": "The code utilizes POSIX functions such as pthread_mutex_unlock and pthread_setcancelstate, which are system-specific extensions in many compiler environments and are not part of the standard C library. These constructs are considered language extensions because they rely on platform-specific features and APIs. Therefore, the use of these POSIX-specific functions constitutes the use of language extensions, making the code violate MISRA C 2023 rule 1.2."
