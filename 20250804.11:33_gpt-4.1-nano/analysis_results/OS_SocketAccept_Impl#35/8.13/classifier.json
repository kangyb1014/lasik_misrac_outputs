  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_SocketAccept_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/283.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_SocketAccept_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SocketAccept_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketAccept_Impl(const OS_object_token_t *sock_token, const OS_object_token_t *conn_token,\n                           OS_SockAddr_t *Addr, int32 timeout)\n{\n    int32                           return_code;\n    uint32                          operation;\n    socklen_t                       addrlen;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *sock_impl;\n    OS_impl_file_internal_record_t *conn_impl;\n\n    sock_impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *sock_token);\n    conn_impl = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *conn_token);\n\n    operation = OS_STREAM_STATE_READABLE;\n    if (sock_impl->selectable)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_SelectSingle_Impl(sock_token, &operation, timeout);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n\n    if (return_code == OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        if ((operation & OS_STREAM_STATE_READABLE) == 0)\n        {\n            return_code = OS_ERROR_TIMEOUT;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            addrlen       = Addr->ActualLength;\n            conn_impl->fd = accept(sock_impl->fd, (struct sockaddr *)&Addr->AddrData, &addrlen);\n            if (conn_impl->fd < 0)\n            {\n                return_code = OS_ERROR;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Addr->ActualLength = addrlen;\n\n                OS_IMPL_SET_SOCKET_FLAGS(conn_token);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_SocketAccept_Impl code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer 'Addr' points to a 'OS_SockAddr_t' structure, and the function modifies its 'ActualLength' member, which is acceptable. However, the function passes '&Addr->AddrData' to 'accept', which is not a const-qualified pointer, but the rule concerns whether the pointer itself should be to a const type to prevent modifications when not necessary. Since 'Addr' is passed as a non-const pointer and the function modifies its members, the rule is not violated.",
