  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/267.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint:\n```c\nbool OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint(void *ref, const OS_object_token_t *token, const OS_common_record_t *obj)\n{\n    OS_filesys_internal_record_t *filesys;\n    const char *                  target = (const char *)ref;\n    size_t                        mplen;\n\n    filesys = OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_filesys_table, *token);\n\n    if ((filesys->flags & OS_FILESYS_FLAG_IS_MOUNTED_VIRTUAL) == 0)\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    mplen = OS_strnlen(filesys->virtual_mountpt, sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt));\n\n    /*\n     * The virtual_mountpt member should be a substring of the search target.\n     * If this matches a basic substring check then it may be match\n     */\n    if (mplen == 0 || mplen >= sizeof(filesys->virtual_mountpt) ||\n        strncmp(target, filesys->virtual_mountpt, mplen) != 0)\n    {\n        /* not a substring, so not a match */\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * Confirm that the substring ends at either a directory separator\n     * or the end of string  (so exact mount points also match).\n     *\n     * For instance consider a virtual_mountpt of /mnt/abc and searching\n     * for target=/mnt/abcd - this should return false in that case.\n     */\n    return (target[mplen] == '/' || target[mplen] == 0);\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above OS_FileSys_FindVirtMountPoint code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer 'target' is declared as 'const char *', pointing to a string literal or other const-qualified data, which is good practice. However, the function does not modify the data pointed to by 'target', thus it adheres to the principles of Rule 8.13, as it does not use a pointer to a non-const type to modify the object.",
