  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_SymbolLookup_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/26.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_SymbolLookup_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SymbolLookup_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SymbolLookup_Impl(cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    int32            status;\n    int32            local_status;\n    OS_object_iter_t iter;\n\n    /* First search global table */\n    status = OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(OSAL_DLSYM_DEFAULT_HANDLE, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n\n    /* If not found iterate through module local symbols and break if found */\n    if (status != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        OS_ObjectIdIterateActive(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_MODULE, &iter);\n        while (OS_ObjectIdIteratorGetNext(&iter))\n        {\n            local_status = OS_ModuleSymbolLookup_Impl(&iter.token, SymbolAddress, SymbolName);\n            if (local_status == OS_SUCCESS)\n            {\n                status = local_status;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(&iter);\n    }\n\n    return status;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SymbolLookup_Impl:\nint32 OS_GenericSymbolLookup_Impl(void *dl_handle, cpuaddr *SymbolAddress, const char *SymbolName)\n{\n    const char *dlError; /*  Pointer to error string   */\n    void *      Function;\n    int32       status;\n\n    status = OS_ERROR;\n\n    /*\n     * call dlerror() to clear any prior error that might have occurred.\n     */\n    dlerror();\n    Function = dlsym(dl_handle, SymbolName);\n    dlError  = dlerror();\n\n    /*\n     * For the POSIX DL implementation, if the symbol does not exist\n     * then dlerror() is supposed to return non-null.
