  "explanation": "The function 'OS_SymbolLookup_Impl' takes a pointer parameter 'SymbolAddress' that is used to receive output data from other functions, which inherently involves modifying the object pointed to by 'SymbolAddress'. The MISRA C 2023 rule 17.8 states that a function parameter should not be modified, but in the case of output parameters (which are intended to be modified to return data), this rule is typically understood not to apply. The rule aims to prevent functions from modifying input parameters that are meant to be inputs only, not outputs. Since 'SymbolAddress' is used as an output pointer to store the found symbol's address, and this is a common and intended use pattern in C, the modification of the object pointed to by 'SymbolAddress' does not constitute a violation of this rule. Therefore, the claim that the function violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 by modifying 'SymbolAddress' is not correct."
