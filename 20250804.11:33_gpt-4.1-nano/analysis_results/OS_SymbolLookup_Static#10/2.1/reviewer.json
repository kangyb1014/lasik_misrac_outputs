  "explanation": "The code contains multiple 'break' statements within a 'while' loop that are conditionally executed based on the data encountered. While these breaks do cause some code to exit the loop early, they do not make any code unreachable in the strict sense defined by MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1. Unreachable code typically refers to code that can never be executed regardless of the runtime conditions, such as code after a 'return' statement or an infinite loop with no exit. In this case, the 'break' statements are reachable and serve to exit the loop when necessary. Therefore, the conditionally executed 'break's do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
