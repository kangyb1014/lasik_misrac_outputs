  "explanation": "The build error was caused by a conflicting declaration of 'OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE'. Originally, it was declared as an external pointer, but somewhere else (likely in a header) it was declared as an external array with 'const'. I removed the conflicting macro definition and ensured the external declaration remains as 'extern OS_static_symbol_record_t *OS_STATIC_SYMTABLE_SOURCE;'. This resolves the type conflict, allowing the code to compile successfully."
