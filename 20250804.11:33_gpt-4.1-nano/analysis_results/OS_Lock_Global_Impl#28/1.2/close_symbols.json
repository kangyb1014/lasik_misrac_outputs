  "explanation": "The symbols 'pthread_mutex_lock' and 'strerror' are required because they are used within the target function. 'pthread_mutex_lock' is a POSIX thread function for locking mutexes, and 'strerror' retrieves error messages associated with error codes. For analyzing violations of the MISRA C rule regarding language extensions, understanding the use of these functions is crucial, as they are part of the POSIX standard and may be considered language extensions depending on the compiler's adherence to standard C. Therefore, their presence needs to be verified against the compiler's extension allowances."
