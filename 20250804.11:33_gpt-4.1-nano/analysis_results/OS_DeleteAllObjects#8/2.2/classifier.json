  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_DeleteAllObjects code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/66.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_DeleteAllObjects as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_DeleteAllObjects:\n```c\nvoid OS_DeleteAllObjects(void)\n{\n    uint32 ObjectCount;\n    uint32 TryCount;\n\n    /*\n     * Note - this is done in a loop because some objects depend on other objects\n     * and you will not be able to delete the object until the ref count becomes zero.\n     */\n    TryCount = 0;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        ObjectCount = 0;\n        ++TryCount;\n\n        /* Delete timers and tasks first, as they could be actively using other object types  */\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMECB, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TIMEBASE, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n        OS_ForEachObjectOfType(OS_OBJECT_TYPE_OS_TASK, OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        /* Then try to delete all other remaining objects of any type */\n        OS_ForEachObject(OS_OBJECT_CREATOR_ANY, OS_CleanUpObject, &ObjectCount);\n\n        if (ObjectCount == 0 || TryCount > 4)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n        OS_TaskDelay(5);\n    }\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_DeleteAllObjects:\nint32 OS_ObjectIdIteratorInit(OS_ObjectMatchFunc_t matchfunc, void *matcharg, osal_objtype_t objtype,\n                              OS_object_iter_t *iter)\n{\n    iter->match = matchfunc;\n    iter->arg   = matcharg;\n    iter->limit = OS_GetMaxForObjectType(objtype);\n    iter->base  = &OS_common_table[OS_GetBaseForObjectType(objtype)];\n\n    return OS_ObjectIdTransactionInit(OS_LOCK_MODE_GLOBAL, objtype, &iter->token);\n}\n...\nint32 OS_ObjectIdIteratorProcessEntry(OS_object_iter_t *iter, int32 (*func)(osal_id_t, void *))\n{\n    int32 status;\n\n    /*\n     * This needs to temporarily unlock the global,\n     * call the handler function, then re-lock.\n     */\n    OS_Unlock_Global(&iter->token);\n    status = func(OS_ObjectIdFromToken(&iter->token), iter->arg);\n    OS_Lock_Global(&iter->token);\n\n    return status;\n}\n...\nvoid OS_ObjectIdIteratorDestroy(OS_object_iter_t *iter)\n{\n    OS_ObjectIdTransactionCancel(&iter->token);\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_DeleteAllObjects code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "The function OS_DeleteAllObjects contains a loop where ObjectCount is reset to zero at the beginning of each iteration. It then calls multiple functions to delete objects of specific types and to delete remaining objects. The loop breaks either when ObjectCount becomes zero or after a maximum of 4 attempts. If ObjectCount is zero at the start of an iteration, no objects are processed or deleted within that iteration, meaning the loop doesn't perform any operations that affect program behavior, constituting dead code.",
