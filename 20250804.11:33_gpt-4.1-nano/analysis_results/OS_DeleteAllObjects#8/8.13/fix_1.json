  "explanation": "I replaced the casted empty blocks with NULL for the callback parameters, because the original code attempted to cast a code block to a function pointer type, which is invalid. The callback parameter is expected to be a function pointer of type OS_ArgCallback_t, and passing NULL indicates no callback functions are used. This change preserves the original logic while fixing the compilation errors caused by invalid expressions."
