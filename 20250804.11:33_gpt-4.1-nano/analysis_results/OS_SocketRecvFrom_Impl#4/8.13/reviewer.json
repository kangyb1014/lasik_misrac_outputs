  "is_report_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The scenario suggests that a 'const OS_SockAddr_t *' is used as an argument to OS_SocketRecvFrom_Impl, and within the function, the code attempts to modify the object pointed to by 'RemoteAddr'. According to the code, if 'RemoteAddr' is NULL, the pointer 'sa' is set to NULL; otherwise, 'sa' points to 'RemoteAddr->AddrData', which implies that 'RemoteAddr' may be used to modify its contents, such as 'ActualLength'. If 'RemoteAddr' were 'const', then such modification would violate the 'const' qualifier. However, the code as provided does not explicitly declare 'RemoteAddr' as 'const OS_SockAddr_t *'. If the caller passes a 'const' pointer, then the code would indeed modify the address data, violating the const-correctness rule. Therefore, the scenario is valid assuming that 'RemoteAddr' is declared as 'const' by the caller, leading to a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13."
