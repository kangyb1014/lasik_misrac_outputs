  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_NetworkGetID code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/19.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_NetworkGetID as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_NetworkGetID:\n```c\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID(void)\n{\n    int32 IdBuf;\n\n    /* always delegate to low-level API */\n    if (OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(&IdBuf) != OS_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        /* return a hardcoded value on failure */\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    return IdBuf;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_NetworkGetID:\nint32 OS_NetworkGetID_Impl(int32 *IdBuf)\n{\n    /* gethostid() has no failure modes */\n    *IdBuf = gethostid();\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_NetworkGetID code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",

  "scenario": "The function OS_NetworkGetID delegates to OS_NetworkGetID_Impl, which takes a non-const pointer. If OS_NetworkGetID_Impl were to modify the pointer content when it should be pointing to const data, it would violate Rule 8.13. In this case, OS_NetworkGetID does not modify the data through the pointer, but the pointer passed to OS_NetworkGetID_Impl is non-const and could potentially be used to modify data when pointing to const data.",
