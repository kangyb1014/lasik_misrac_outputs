First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body.

  "explanation": "The scenario described involves a standard for loop with a well-formed structure: a clear initialization (`int i = 0`), a loop condition (`i <= VOLATILE_DISK_LOC_MAX`), and an increment operation (`++i`). The scenario mentions the use of the loop counter 'i' within the loop body and its involvement in a switch-case statement, but it does not indicate that the 'i' variable is modified improperly within the loop body itself (e.g., being assigned directly or modified via pointer or function calls that change its value). Based on the typical interpretation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2, such use does not violate the rule if the loop is well-formed and the loop counter is only modified by the for loop's increment expression. The provided code snippet also suggests no modifications to 'i' inside the loop body, so the scenario aligns with the rule. Therefore, the claim that this scenario violates Rule 14.2 appears to be incorrect."
