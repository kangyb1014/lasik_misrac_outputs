  "explanation": "The provided OS_FileSys_Initialize code does not contain any usage of 'memcmp' or similar comparison functions to compare null-terminated strings. The only string comparison present is via 'strncmp' and direct character checks, which are compliant with MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. The scenario described by agent A that claims 'memcmp' is used to compare strings appears to be hypothetical or based on an incorrect assumption, as there is no such usage in the code. Therefore, the claim that the code violates MISRA Rule 21.14 due to 'memcmp' use is not supported by the provided code."
