  "explanation": "I fixed the code by adding the missing type definition for 'int32' to 'int32_t' for compatibility with standard types, and I also changed the string literals in 'fprintf' to include proper escape sequences. The rest of the code remained unchanged to preserve the original logic. This ensures the code compiles successfully, assuming necessary headers and definitions (like 'OS_object_token_t', 'OS_TranslatePath', 'OS_SUCCESS') are provided elsewhere in the project."
