  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/107.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl(char *buffer, size_t buflen, const OS_SockAddr_t *Addr)\n{\n    const void *                  addrbuffer;\n    const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *Accessor;\n\n    Accessor = (const OS_SockAddr_Accessor_t *)&Addr->AddrData;\n\n    switch (Accessor->sa.sa_family)\n    {\n        case AF_INET:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in.sin_addr;\n            break;\n#ifdef OS_NETWORK_SUPPORTS_IPV6\n        case AF_INET6:\n            addrbuffer = &Accessor->sa_in6.sin6_addr;\n            break;\n#endif\n        default:\n            return OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    if (inet_ntop(Accessor->sa.sa_family, addrbuffer, buffer, buflen) == NULL)\n    {\n        return OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return OS_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl:\n#define OS_ERR_BAD_ADDRESS (-34)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function OS_SocketAddrToString_Impl receives a pointer to a constant structure OS_SockAddr_t, indicating it should not modify the data. The function does not modify the object pointed to by Addr, so passing a const pointer is appropriate and adheres to Rule 8.13. However, if in some context the function was used in a way that allowed modification of the object pointed to by Addr, it would violate the rule. In this code, the pointer 'Addr' is to const, and no modification occurs, so no violation is present.",
