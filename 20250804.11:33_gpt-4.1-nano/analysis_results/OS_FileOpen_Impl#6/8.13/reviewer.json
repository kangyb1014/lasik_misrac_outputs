  "explanation": "The rule 8.13 of MISRA C 2023 emphasizes that pointers should point to const-qualified types whenever possible, especially when the function does not modify the pointed-to objects. In the provided code, 'token' is a pointer to 'OS_object_token_t' which is used in 'OS_OBJECT_TABLE_GET(OS_impl_filehandle_table, *token)'. Since 'token' is used solely to retrieve 'impl' and is not modified or intended to be modified within the function, it appears to be correctly declared as a pointer to a const-qualified type, assuming 'OS_object_token_t' itself is a non-modified type. The code does not show any modification to '*token', and the 'const' qualifier helps prevent accidental modifications. Therefore, the claim that this violates rule 8.13 is not supported by the code analysis alone, and without explicit knowledge of the 'OS_object_token_t' type's constness, the code seems compliant. The test scenario, which claims that a pointer to a non-const structure is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to, does not appear to be accurate in this context, as 'token' is used only for lookup. Hence, the report that this violates rule 8.13 appears unsubstantiated."
