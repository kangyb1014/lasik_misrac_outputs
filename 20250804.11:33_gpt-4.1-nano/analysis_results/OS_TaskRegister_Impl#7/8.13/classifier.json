  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified OS_TaskRegister_Impl code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/59.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of OS_TaskRegister_Impl as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of OS_TaskRegister_Impl:\n```c\nint32 OS_TaskRegister_Impl(osal_id_t global_task_id)\n{\n    int32                    return_code;\n    OS_VoidPtrValueWrapper_t arg;\n    int                      old_state;\n    int                      old_type;\n\n    /*\n     * Set cancel state=ENABLED, type=DEFERRED\n     * This should be the default for new threads, but\n     * setting explicitly to be sure that a pthread_join()\n     * will work as expected in case this thread is deleted.\n     */\n    pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, &old_state);\n    pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &old_type);\n\n    memset(&arg, 0, sizeof(arg));\n\n    /* cppcheck-suppress unreadVariable // intentional use of other union member */\n    arg.id = global_task_id;\n\n    return_code = pthread_setspecific(POSIX_GlobalVars.ThreadKey, arg.opaque_arg);\n    if (return_code == 0)\n    {\n        return_code = OS_SUCCESS;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        OS_DEBUG(\"OS_TaskRegister_Impl failed during pthread_setspecific() error=%s\\n\", strerror(return_code));\n        return_code = OS_ERROR;\n    }\n\n    return return_code;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function OS_TaskRegister_Impl:\n#define OS_DEBUG(__VA_ARGS__) \n...\n#define OS_SUCCESS (0)\n...\n#define OS_ERROR (-1)\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above OS_TaskRegister_Impl code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
