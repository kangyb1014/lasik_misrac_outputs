  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 is: Use of the string handling functions from <string.h> shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters.\nThis rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified not_found_page code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/583.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of not_found_page as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of not_found_page:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nnot_found_page (const void *cls,\n                const char *mime,\n                struct Session *session,\n                struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  (void) cls;     /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function not_found_page calls strlen on the macro NOT_FOUND_ERROR, which is a string literal. Using strlen on a valid null-terminated string literal is safe and does not access out of bounds. Subsequently, the string literal pointer is passed to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static, which presumably treats it correctly. There is no evidence that string handling functions access beyond the bounds of objects referenced by their pointers. Therefore, no violation of Rule 21.17 occurs.",
