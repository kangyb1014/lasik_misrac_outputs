  "explanation": "- ws_receive_frame: This function processes the incoming buffer and returns a message pointer; understanding its handling of buffers and returned pointer is essential to ensure no out-of-bounds access occurs when further processing msg.\n- ws_send_frame: Used to send frames including user-generated text; analysis is needed to confirm it safely handles the provided buffers without overrunning.\n- send_all: Called indirectly via ws_send_frame; since it calls make_blocking and may handle buffer transmissions, its safety regarding string/buffer boundaries affects overall safety.\n- make_blocking: Used to set socket behavior; while not directly related to string handling, its proper functioning affects subsequent buffer operations.\n- MHD_upgrade_action: Function called at the end managing upgrade responses; to check if any buffer operations could indirectly affect safety.\n- MUTEX: Used for synchronization when modifying CLIENT_SOCKS; needed to understand concurrency aspects that might affect memory safety.\n- CLIENT_SOCKS, MAX_CLIENTS, MHD_INVALID_SOCKET: These symbols are related to client management and socket array boundaries; crucial to verify that array accesses do not occur out of bounds.\n- WS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME, WS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: Opcode constants used to determine message types; important to understand control flow and corresponding buffer usage.\n\nAll these symbols are necessary to analyze how buffers and pointers are managed and to verify that none of the string operations or pointer manipulations exceed object bounds, thereby ensuring compliance with the MISRA C string handling rule."
