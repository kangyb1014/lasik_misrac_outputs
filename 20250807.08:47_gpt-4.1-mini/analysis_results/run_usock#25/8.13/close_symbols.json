  "explanation": "To analyze whether the run_usock function complies with the MISRA C pointer const-qualification rule, we need to understand the functions it calls and key system/library functions it uses. The callees 'ws_receive_frame' and 'ws_send_frame' handle pointers to data buffers and might modify the pointed data, so knowing their behavior is essential. 'send_all' is called indirectly by 'ws_send_frame' and 'make_blocking' affects socket state, potentially influencing buffer usage. 'MHD_upgrade_action' and its callee 'MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_' handle the upgrade response handle pointer, so their parameter usage must be checked. Standard functions 'malloc', 'free', and 'snprintf' manipulate pointers and buffers directly used in run_usock. 'pthread_mutex_lock' and 'pthread_mutex_unlock' manage synchronization but could affect pointer states in multi-threaded contexts. 'abort' and 'recv' are system/library functions dealing with pointers and control flow, important for comprehensive analysis. Thus, including these symbols allows examining if pointers passed, returned, or modified comply with const-correctness and whether pointers point to appropriately qualified objects, ensuring no violations of the MISRA C pointer const-qualification rule."
