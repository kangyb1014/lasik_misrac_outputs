  "explanation": "The target function uses the standard library functions strcmp and strstr for string comparison and searching. To analyze compliance with the MISRA C rule about string handling functions not accessing beyond object bounds, the behavior and inputs to these functions must be fully understood. Therefore, the symbols 'strcmp' and 'strstr' are required. Additionally, the macro or constant 'WS_UPGRADE_VALUE' is used as a comparison string in strcmp. Its definition and size must be known to verify that the argument to strcmp is valid and properly bounded, ensuring no out-of-bound access occurs."
