Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To analyze whether the function is_websocket_request contains dead code, the constants MHD_YES and MHD_NO must be understood to determine if their use affects program behavior or if they are redundant. WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is necessary to assess the strcmp comparison's relevance within the function. The standard library functions strcmp and strstr are essential to analyze the conditions checked in the return statement, ensuring that all parts of the condition impact the function's output and behavior. Without understanding these symbols, it is not possible to conclude if any operation in the function is dead code under the MISRA C rule."
