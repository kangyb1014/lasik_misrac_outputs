  "explanation": "The claim that the code contains unreachable code is incorrect. The preprocessor directives (#if, #else) control which code blocks are included during compilation based on the defined macros. If neither MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS nor MHD_USE_W32_THREADS is defined, the code inside the #if block is simply excluded by the preprocessor; it is not unreachable code. Unreachable code refers to code that cannot be executed during runtime despite being compiled, such as statements after a return or goto that are never reached. Here, the selection happens at compile time, resulting in code that is either present or absent in the compiled binary, so no unreachable runtime code exists. Therefore, the report that this violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 (no unreachable code) is incorrect."
