  "scenario": "If the mutex unlock function internally uses string handling functions such as memcpy or memset without proper bounds checking on the objects referenced by their pointer parameters, it could lead to out-of-bounds accesses violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. However, in the given MHD_ip_count_unlock function, no direct use of string handling functions from <string.h> is present, and the function itself only calls MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ which presumably handles mutex unlocking safely.",
