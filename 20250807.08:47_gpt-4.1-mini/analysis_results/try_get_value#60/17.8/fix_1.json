  "explanation": "The compiler error was caused by the incorrect usage of double quotes inside the string in the fprintf call. Specifically, the string contained unescaped double quotes: Expected '\"' but got '%c'\\n. In C, to include a double quote character inside a string literal, it must be escaped as \\\". The original code wrote: \"Expected '\"' but got '%c'\\n\" which confuses the compiler due to the unescaped quote.\n\nTo fix this, I replaced the \" inside the string with '\\\"' (a character literal), which is the correct way to represent a double quote character in fprintf format strings when expecting a char.\n\nThus, the line:\n\n    fprintf(log, \"Value not quoted properly. Expected '\"' but got '%c'\\n\", spos[klen + 1]);\n\nbecomes:\n\n    fprintf(log, \"Value not quoted properly. Expected '\"' but got '%c'\\n\", spos[klen + 1]);\n\nwith the inner double quote character properly escaped as '\"'.\n\nAll other code was kept intact to preserve the original logic."
