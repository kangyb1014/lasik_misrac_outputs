  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function compress_buf uses memcpy to copy have bytes from tmp buffer to the newly allocated *dest buffer. The pointer arithmetic ((uint8_t *)(*dest)) + ((*dest_size) - have) assumes that we are copying within the bounds of the allocated memory of *dest. However, if realloc fails, tmp_dest will be NULL and *dest will be freed and set to NULL and function returns early, so no out-of-bounds access occurs there. Also, have is calculated as CHUNK - strm->avail_out, which is guaranteed to be less or equal to CHUNK, and tmp buffer is expected to be at least CHUNK bytes, so the source buffer pointer tmp is valid for 'have' bytes. Therefore, there are no accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by memcpy parameters. Hence, there is no violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 in the given code.",
