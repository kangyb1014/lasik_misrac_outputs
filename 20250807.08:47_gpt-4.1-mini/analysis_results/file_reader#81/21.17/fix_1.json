  "explanation": "The build warning arose because the format specifier '%d' was incorrectly used for printing 'SSIZE_MAX', which is of type 'ssize_t' (typically 'long int' on many platforms). To fix this, I changed the format specifier from '%d' to '%zu' and cast 'SSIZE_MAX' to 'size_t' in the relevant fprintf call. This ensures the format specifier matches the argument type and eliminates the warning. No other code logic was modified, preserving the original functionality."
