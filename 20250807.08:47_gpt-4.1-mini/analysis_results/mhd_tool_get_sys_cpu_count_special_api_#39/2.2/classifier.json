  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_ code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/314.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_ as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_:\n```c\nstatic int\nmhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_ (void)\n{\n  int ret = -1;\n#ifdef HAVE_PSTAT_GETDYNAMIC\n  if (0 >= ret)\n  {\n    /* HP-UX things */\n    struct pst_dynamic psd_data;\n    memset ((void *) &psd_data, 0, sizeof (psd_data));\n    if (1 == pstat_getdynamic (&psd_data, sizeof (psd_data), (size_t) 1, 0))\n    {\n      if (0 < psd_data.psd_proc_cnt)\n        ret = (int) psd_data.psd_proc_cnt;\n    }\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_PSTAT_GETDYNAMIC */\n#ifdef HAVE_VXCPUENABLEDGET\n  if (0 >= ret)\n  {\n    /* VxWorks */\n    cpuset_t enb_set;\n    enb_set = vxCpuEnabledGet ();\n    /* Count set bits */\n    for (ret = 0; 0 != enb_set; enb_set &= enb_set - 1)\n      ++ret;\n  }\n#endif /* HAVE_VXCPUENABLEDGET */\n#if defined(_WIN32) && ! defined (__CYGWIN__)\n  if (0 >= ret)\n  {\n    /* Native W32 */\n    HMODULE k32hndl;\n    k32hndl = LoadLibraryA (\"kernel32.dll\");\n    if (NULL != k32hndl)\n    {\n      typedef DWORD (WINAPI *GAPC_PTR)(WORD GroupNumber);\n      GAPC_PTR ptrGetActiveProcessorCount;\n      /* Available on W7 or later */\n      ptrGetActiveProcessorCount =\n        (GAPC_PTR) (void *) GetProcAddress (k32hndl, \"GetActiveProcessorCount\");\n      if (NULL != ptrGetActiveProcessorCount)\n      {\n        DWORD res;\n        res = ptrGetActiveProcessorCount (ALL_PROCESSOR_GROUPS);\n        ret = (int) res;\n        if (res != (DWORD) ret)\n          ret = -1; /* Overflow */\n      }\n    }\n    if ((0 >= ret) && (NULL != k32hndl))\n    {\n      typedef void (WINAPI *GNSI_PTR)(SYSTEM_INFO *pSysInfo);\n      GNSI_PTR ptrGetNativeSystemInfo;\n      /* May give incorrect (low) result on versions from W7 to W11\n         when more then 64 CPUs are available */\n      ptrGetNativeSystemInfo =\n        (GNSI_PTR) (void *) GetProcAddress (k32hndl, \"GetNativeSystemInfo\");\n      if (NULL != ptrGetNativeSystemInfo)\n      {\n        SYSTEM_INFO sysInfo;\n\n        memset ((void *) &sysInfo, 0, sizeof (sysInfo));\n        ptrGetNativeSystemInfo (&sysInfo);\n        ret = (int) sysInfo.dwNumberOfProcessors;\n        if (sysInfo.dwNumberOfProcessors != (DWORD) ret)\n          ret = -1; /* Overflow */\n      }\n    }\n    if (NULL != k32hndl)\n      FreeLibrary (k32hndl);\n  }\n  if (0 >= ret)\n  {\n    /* May give incorrect (low) result on versions from W7 to W11\n       when more then 64 CPUs are available */\n    SYSTEM_INFO sysInfo;\n    memset ((void *) &sysInfo, 0, sizeof (sysInfo));\n    GetSystemInfo (&sysInfo);\n    ret = (int) sysInfo.dwNumberOfProcessors;\n    if (sysInfo.dwNumberOfProcessors != (DWORD) ret)\n      ret = -1; /* Overflow */\n  }\n#endif /* _WIN32 && ! __CYGWIN__ */\n  if (0 >= ret)\n    return -1;\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_ code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "If the macro HAVE_PSTAT_GETDYNAMIC is defined, the variable psd_data is fully zero-initialized by memset before usage. The memset operation is necessary for initialization and not considered a dead code assignment. Thus, all assignments and operations in the function affect program behavior or are required initializations. Hence, there is no code that executes but whose removal would not affect the program behavior.",
