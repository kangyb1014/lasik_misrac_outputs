  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified iterate_post code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/451.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of iterate_post as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of iterate_post:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\niterate_post (void *coninfo_cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key,\n              const char *filename, const char *content_type,\n              const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, uint64_t off,\n              size_t size)\n{\n  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls;\n  (void) kind;               /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The pointer parameter 'data' in function 'iterate_post' is used as a source for string formatting in 'snprintf'. The pointer 'data' points to a const-qualified type (const char *), and the data it points to is not modified by the function. Therefore, the pointer is correctly pointing to a const-qualified type as per the rule.",
