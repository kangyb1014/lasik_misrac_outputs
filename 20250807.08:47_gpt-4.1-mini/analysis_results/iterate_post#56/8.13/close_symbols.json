  "explanation": "To analyze the iterate_post function for the MISRA C rule on pointer const qualification, these symbols are needed: strcmp - to confirm it does not modify the pointed-to string 'key'; malloc - to verify allocated memory usage and pointer mutability; snprintf - to ensure output to 'answerstring' is proper and respects const correctness; GREETINGPAGE, MAXANSWERSIZE, MAXNAMESIZE - constants that affect buffer sizes and string formatting, relevant for pointer usage scopes; struct connection_info_struct - to understand the member 'answerstring' and whether it is a const pointer or points to modifiable data; MHD_NO and MHD_YES - enum return values indicating function outcomes but do not affect pointer constness directly. Collectively, these symbols allow determining if pointer parameters and internal pointers are used adhering to the rule about const qualification and modification."
