This rule strictly applies to the Standard Library functions in <string.h> such as memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, and strspn.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To analyze the target function for violations of the MISRA C string handling rule, the following symbols are needed: 1. strcmp - Used to compare the 'key' string; its behavior must be known to ensure it doesn't read beyond 'key'. 2. MAXNAMESIZE - Maximum allowed size for 'size' when copying data, critical to ensure no buffer overflow occurs when accessing 'data'. 3. MAXANSWERSIZE - Defines the buffer size allocated for 'answerstring'; essential to verify that snprintf usage does not exceed this buffer size. 4. snprintf - Used to format a string into 'answerstring'; understanding its behavior and the size argument is key to confirming safe string operations. 5. malloc - Used to allocate memory for 'answerstring'; knowing if allocation can succeed or fail affects pointer safety. 6. MHD_NO and MHD_YES - Return values that control the function's flow; understanding their use informs the contexts in which string functions are called. 7. GREETINGPAGE - Format string used by snprintf; necessary to analyze how 'data' is incorporated into the buffer and if it could cause overruns. These symbols collectively enable thorough assessment of potential out-of-bounds accesses in string operations within the function."
