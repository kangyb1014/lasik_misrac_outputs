  "explanation": "To analyze whether the target function violates the MISRA C rule (no use of memcmp for comparing null terminated strings), we need to examine all string comparison functions used in it. The function uses 'strcmp', so the implementation or behavior of 'strcmp' is critical to confirm it doesn't internally use 'memcmp'. 'malloc' and 'snprintf' are related to memory allocation and string formatting but do not relate to string comparison; still, understanding them helps fully analyze function behavior. The enum 'MHD_Result' and its values 'MHD_NO' and 'MHD_YES' are needed for understanding return codes. The 'struct connection_info_struct' is used to store results, so its definition helps understand side effects. Constants 'MAXNAMESIZE', 'MAXANSWERSIZE', and 'GREETINGPAGE' affect string sizes and formatting, relevant for understanding overall function correctness but not for the MISRA rule directly. Overall, the key symbol to verify adherence to the MISRA rule is 'strcmp'."
