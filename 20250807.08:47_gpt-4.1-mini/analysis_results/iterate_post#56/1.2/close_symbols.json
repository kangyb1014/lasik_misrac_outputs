  "explanation": "To analyze the target function for MISRA C compliance regarding language extensions, the symbols 'strcmp', 'malloc', and 'snprintf' must be checked to confirm if they use any compiler-specific extensions. The macros 'MAXNAMESIZE' and 'MAXANSWERSIZE', and the constant 'GREETINGPAGE' must be reviewed to ensure they are defined in standard-compliant ways without extensions. The enum type 'MHD_Result' and its values 'MHD_NO' and 'MHD_YES' are necessary to verify their definitions for compliance. Additionally, the 'struct connection_info_struct' is needed to confirm its definition does not involve any language extensions."
