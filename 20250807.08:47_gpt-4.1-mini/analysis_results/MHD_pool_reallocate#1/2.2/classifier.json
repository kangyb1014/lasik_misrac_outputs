  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified MHD_pool_reallocate code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/10.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of MHD_pool_reallocate as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of MHD_pool_reallocate:\n```c\nvoid *\nMHD_pool_reallocate (struct MemoryPool *pool,\n                     void *old,\n                     size_t old_size,\n                     size_t new_size)\n{\n  size_t asize;\n  uint8_t *new_blc;\n\n  mhd_assert (pool->end >= pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= pool->end - pool->pos);\n  mhd_assert (old != NULL || old_size == 0);\n  mhd_assert (pool->size >= old_size);\n  mhd_assert (pool->pos == ROUND_TO_ALIGN (pool->pos));\n#if defined(MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE) && defined(HAVE___ASAN_REGION_IS_POISONED)\n  mhd_assert (NULL == __asan_region_is_poisoned (old, old_size));\n#endif /* MHD_ASAN_POISON_ACTIVE && HAVE___ASAN_REGION_IS_POISONED */\n\n  if (NULL != old)\n  {   /* Have previously allocated data */\n    const size_t old_offset = mp_ptr_diff_ (old, pool->memory);\n    const bool shrinking = (old_size > new_size);\n\n    mhd_assert (mp_ptr_le_ (pool->memory, old));\n    /* (pool->memory + pool->size >= (uint8_t*) old + old_size) */\n    mhd_assert ((pool->size - _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE) >= (old_offset + old_size));\n    /* Blocks \"from the end\" must not be reallocated */\n    /* (old_size == 0 || pool->memory + pool->pos > (uint8_t*) old) */\n    mhd_assert ((old_size == 0) || \\\n                (pool->pos > old_offset));\n    mhd_assert ((old_size == 0) || \\\n                ((pool->end - _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE) >= (old_offset + old_size)));\n    /* Try resizing in-place */\n    if (shrinking)\n    {     /* Shrinking in-place, zero-out freed part */\n      memset ((uint8_t *) old + new_size, 0, old_size - new_size);\n      _MHD_POISON_MEMORY ((uint8_t *) old + new_size, old_size - new_size);\n    }\n    if (pool->pos ==\n        ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (old_offset + old_size))\n    {     /* \"old\" block is the last allocated block */\n      const size_t new_apos =\n        ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (old_offset + new_size);\n      if (! shrinking)\n      {                               /* Grow in-place, check for enough space. */\n        if ( (new_apos > pool->end) ||\n             (new_apos < pool->pos) ) /* Value wrap */\n          return NULL;                /* No space */\n      }\n      /* Resized in-place */\n      pool->pos = new_apos;\n      _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (old, new_size);\n      return old;\n    }\n    if (shrinking)\n      return old;   /* Resized in-place, freed part remains allocated */\n  }\n  /* Need to allocate new block */\n  asize = ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE (new_size);\n  if ( ( (0 == asize) &&\n         (0 != new_size) ) || /* Value wrap, too large new_size. */\n       (asize > pool->end - pool->pos) ) /* Not enough space */\n    return NULL;\n\n  new_blc = pool->memory + pool->pos;\n  pool->pos += asize;\n\n  _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY (new_blc, new_size);\n  if (0 != old_size)\n  {\n    /* Move data to new block, old block remains allocated */\n    memcpy (new_blc, old, old_size);\n    /* Zero-out old block */\n    memset (old, 0, old_size);\n    _MHD_POISON_MEMORY (old, old_size);\n  }\n  return new_blc;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function MHD_pool_reallocate:\n#define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0)\n...\n#define ROUND_TO_ALIGN(n) (((n)+(ALIGN_SIZE-1))/(ALIGN_SIZE)*(ALIGN_SIZE))\n...\n#define ROUND_TO_ALIGN_PLUS_RED_ZONE(n) ROUND_TO_ALIGN(n)\n...\n#define mp_ptr_diff_(p1, p2) ((size_t)(((constuint8_t*)(p1))-((constuint8_t*)(p2))))\n...\n#define mp_ptr_le_(p1, p2) (((constuint8_t*)(p1))<=((constuint8_t*)(p2)))\n...\n#define _MHD_RED_ZONE_SIZE (0)\n...\n#define _MHD_POISON_MEMORY(pointer, size) (void)0\n...\n#define _MHD_UNPOISON_MEMORY(pointer, size) (void)0\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above MHD_pool_reallocate code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
