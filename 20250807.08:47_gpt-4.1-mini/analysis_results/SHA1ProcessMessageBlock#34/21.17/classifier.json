  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "If context->message_block has fewer than 64 bytes initialized or accessible, accesses to context->message_block[i * 4 + x] (for i from 0 to 15 and x from 0 to 3) in the first loop could go beyond its bounds, violating Rule 21.17 due to string.h strcpy/memcpy/memset usage assumptions (here replaced by direct array accesses). However, the code does not use any string handling functions from <string.h>, so no direct violations occur. The rule applies only to functions like memcpy, memset, strcpy, etc., which are not invoked here. This code accesses a fixed-size array safely within bounds if context->message_block is correctly sized as 64 bytes as defined, so the rule is respected.",
