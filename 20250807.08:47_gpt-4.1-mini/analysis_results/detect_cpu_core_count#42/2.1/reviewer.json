  "explanation": "MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 prohibits unreachable code, i.e., code that can never be executed under any possible control flow. The original code has a series of conditional checks to fall back on CPU core count detection methods if the first attempt fails. The key point is the #ifdef MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT block, which conditionally compiles an additional fallback. This block is only compiled if MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT is defined. If MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT is not defined, that entire block is omitted. However, the subsequent 'if (0 >= sys_cpu_count)' statement after the #ifdef block remains compiled and reachable. The conditional flow still allows this code to execute if the prior conditions didn't set sys_cpu_count to a positive value. Therefore, there is no guaranteed path that makes any statement unreachable regardless of compile-time flags. The code is correctly structured to avoid unreachable code by carefully sequencing the conditionals. The assertion that the #ifdef conditional compilation creates unreachable code is incorrect since code that is excluded by preprocessor directives is simply not present in the translation unit and does not count as unreachable. The presence or absence of MHD_REAL_CPU_COUNT just affects which code is compiled, not code that is compiled but unreachable. The test code attempts to log internal state but failed to compile, so no runtime evidence was produced, but the structural analysis suffices to conclude that no unreachable code exists in compiled code. Hence, the report claiming violation of Rule 2.1 is incorrect."
