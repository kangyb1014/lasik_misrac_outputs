  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "A violation can occur if the functions MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash or MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest use string.h functions such as memcpy or strcpy with size parameters or lengths that exceed the bounds of the destination arrays (e.g., entry->userhash_md5) or source strings (e.g., username, realm, password), leading to buffer overruns. However, the given code itself does not directly call any string.h functions, and the buffers seem to be sized according to the hash sizes, with size parameters passed accordingly. Without implementation details of the called functions, there is no clear evidence of out-of-bounds accesses in this code.",
