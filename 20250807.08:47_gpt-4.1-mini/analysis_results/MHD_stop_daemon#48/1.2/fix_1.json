  "explanation": "The build error occurred because the name `mhd_assert` was defined as a macro in the included header files, which conflicted with our function definition of the same name. To fix this, I renamed the function from `mhd_assert` to `assert_mhd` to avoid macro collision. This allows both the original macro and this function to coexist without conflict. Additionally, I included necessary standard headers (`stdio.h`, `stdbool.h`), added a forward declaration for `MHD_PANIC`, and defined a minimal `struct MHD_Daemon` consistent with the usage. These changes ensure that the code compiles successfully while preserving the original logic and behavior."
