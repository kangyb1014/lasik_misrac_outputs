  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified post_iterator code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/411.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of post_iterator as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of post_iterator:\n```c\nstatic enum MHD_Result\npost_iterator (void *cls,\n               enum MHD_ValueKind kind,\n               const char *key,\n               const char *filename,\n               const char *content_type,\n               const char *transfer_encoding,\n               const char *data, uint64_t off, size_t size)\n{\n  struct Request *request = cls;\n  struct Session *session = request->session;\n  (void) kind;              /* Unused.

  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function post_iterator receives a pointer parameter 'data' declared as 'const char *data', which means data is a pointer to a const-qualified type. However, this pointer is passed to memcpy to copy size bytes into session->value_1 or session->value_2, which are non-const buffers being modified. Since the pointer 'data' points to const-qualified data and the function modifies the destination buffers, this usage follows the rule that a pointer pointing to const-qualified data is used correctly (no violation). But if 'data' were used to point to non-const data that the function modifies through 'data' pointer, it would be a violation. Here, the function modifies the buffers pointed to by session->value_1 and session->value_2, not data. Therefore, the rule is not violated by this code.",
