  "explanation": "The struct MHD_PostProcessor is required to understand the types and const qualifications of its members, especially 'buf', 'state', 'skip_rn', and others which are accessed or modified through pointers. The enum PP_State is needed to determine the correct use and modifications of state variables passed as parameters and assigned. The macro or constant RN_Dash is assigned to 'pp->skip_rn', so its definition might reveal if any constness is involved. The constants PP_Error, MHD_NO, and MHD_YES are used as return values and state assignments, their definitions might show const qualification or affect pointer usage semantics. The function pointer 'pp->ikvi' is called with 'buf' (a non-const pointer derived from &pp[1]) and other parameters; understanding its signature and whether it modifies the data it points to is essential to evaluate if pointers should be const-qualified or not. These symbols collectively allow analysis of pointer constness in the target function and verify compliance with MISRA C rules about pointer const qualification when objects are modified."
