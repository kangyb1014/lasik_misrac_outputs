The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To analyze the target function MHD_MD5_update for compliance with the specified MISRA C rule on well-formed for loops, we need to understand all looping behaviors and side effects. Although the target function uses a while loop rather than a for loop, the called functions within that loop may contain for loops, which must adhere to the rule.\n\n1. md5_transform: This function is called repeatedly inside the while loop and may contain for loops. To verify no loop counter is modified improperly and no side effects violate the rule, we must analyze md5_transform.\n\n2. memcpy: Used in MHD_MD5_update, its behavior is generally known, but if there were macros or wrappers changing behavior or side effects, they should be examined. Generally, memcpy does not contain loops relevant to the rule but confirming this can avoid missing indirect violations.\n\n3. mhd_assert: Used for validation; while assertions typically don't contain loops, checking this macro or function ensures no side effects or loops that affect analysis.\n\n4. MD5_BLOCK_SIZE: A macro or constant that defines the size of blocks processed in loops. Understanding its value is needed to assess loop bounds and conditions to verify loop count usage and side effects for compliance with the rule."
