  "explanation": "Other pointer usages in the function do not need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: \n- The parameter 'unsigned long *phys' is used as an output parameter (the function writes '*phys'), so the pointed-to type must be modifiable and therefore should not be const.\n- The argument '&entry' passed to pread() is a buffer that pread() writes into; the pointed-to object must be non-const so that the call is valid.\n- The return of strerror(errno) is a pointer to a C library buffer; its mutability is governed by the library API and not something the local code can/should change.\n- Other uses of pointers (e.g., passing addresses to logging functions) either refer to non-pointer scalar values or are read-only uses of library-provided pointers where adding const would be inappropriate or impossible.\nNo other pointer declarations or uses in the provided code can be made to point to const-qualified types without changing the intended semantics, so they are not flagged for investigation."
