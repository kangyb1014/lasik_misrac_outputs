The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "- metal_list_for_each (macro): The for loop in the function is written via this macro. To determine whether the three clauses of the for statement are well-formed you must inspect the macro expansion (initialisation, loop condition, and iteration expressions). Only the macro definition will reveal which object is used as the loop counter, whether the first clause initializes it, whether the second clause has side effects or references objects modified in the body, and whether the third clause modifies only the loop counter.\n\n- struct metal_list (definition; members: next, prev): The macro very likely uses the list node fields (typically next/prev). You must know the exact member names and types to check what the iteration expression modifies (e.g. node = node->next) and whether that modification is limited to a single loop counter object.\n\n- _metal (global) and its type that contains .common.bus_list: The macro condition will compare the loop counter against the list head (&_metal.common.bus_list). You need the definition/type of _metal to confirm the head object identity and ensure the condition uses only the loop counter and a head that is not modified in the loop body.\n\n- struct for the .common member (e.g. struct metal_common) and its bus_list member: To verify what &_metal.common.bus_list refers to (its type and whether the body could modify it), you must inspect the declaration of the .common container and the bus_list member.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro): Used inside the loop body to derive struct metal_bus from the list node. You must confirm this macro does not have side effects or modify the loop counter or other objects involved in the loop control (it is normally pure pointer arithmetic).\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition; members: node, name): The loop body accesses bus->name and the node member (used by container_of). You must confirm the node member name matches what the container_of/macro expect and that bus->name or other bus members are not aliases of the loop counter object that could be modified in the body.\n\n- strcmp (declaration/semantics): strcmp is called in the loop body. MISRA requires that behaviour of any functions called in the body be considered. You must confirm strcmp does not modify its arguments or any objects used by the loop control (it is standardly non-modifying)."
