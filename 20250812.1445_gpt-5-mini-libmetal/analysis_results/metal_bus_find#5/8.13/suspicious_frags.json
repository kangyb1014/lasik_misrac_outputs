  "explanation": "I did not include other fragments because they do not present pointer-to-non-const situations that could be improved by adding const, or they are already const-qualified: the function parameter 'name' is const-qualified and the bus->name member is declared as const char *, and strcmp correctly takes const char * arguments. No other pointer declarations or assignments appear in the provided code that would be candidates for const-qualification beyond the fragments listed above."
