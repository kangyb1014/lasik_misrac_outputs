  "explanation": "For deciding whether pointers in metal_bus_find should be const-qualified, the analyzer needs the following precise declarations/definitions:\n\n- struct metal_bus: to know the exact type returned via *result and whether the type itself is intended mutable or should be const-qualified.\n\n- struct metal_bus::name (member declaration): to determine whether bus->name is declared as const char * or char *, which directly affects whether the function should use/return const char * or otherwise adjust qualifiers.\n\n- struct metal_bus::node (member declaration): needed because metal_container_of uses this member to compute the containing struct; its type/qualifiers affect const-correctness of the resulting pointer.\n\n- struct metal_list: to understand the list node type and whether the iteration API requires mutable nodes (influences whether container pointers must be non-const).\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro/inline): the iteration macro's signature/expansion shows whether it yields a mutable node pointer (non-const) or could operate on const lists \u2014 this informs whether metal_bus_find must accept/produce non-const pointers.\n\n- metal_container_of (macro/inline): how the container pointer is computed (casts, use of offsetof, etc.) can break or preserve const qualifiers; the exact macro is needed to judge whether constness is lost/retained.\n\n- _metal (global) and its type (including .common.bus_list): to know the type/qualifiers of the bus_list being iterated and whether it holds mutable struct_metal_bus nodes or const ones.\n\n- strcmp (declaration from <string.h>): to confirm its parameter types (const char *) so you can reason whether passing bus->name to strcmp requires or preserves const.\n\n- metal_bus_register, metal_device_open, metal_linux_bus_finish (caller declarations/definitions): to determine how callers use the returned struct metal_bus (via result). If callers modify the returned struct, it must remain non-const; if callers only read it, the API could/should return a pointer to const. The next-agent analysis must see caller usage to decide if making pointers const would be permissible.\n\n- metal_bus_unregister (if used by callers): included because callers (e.g., metal_linux_bus_finish) that also call unregister may modify or free bus objects; its definition can show whether callers mutate the bus or its fields, which affects whether the bus pointer can be const.\n\nProvide these symbol definitions to the next agent so it can determine whether pointer types in metal_bus_find (e.g., the returned struct metal_bus * via result and bus->name) can/should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule."
