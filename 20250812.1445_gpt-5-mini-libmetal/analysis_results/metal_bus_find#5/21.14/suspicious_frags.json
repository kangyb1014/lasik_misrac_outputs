  "explanation": "I inspected the function for any use of memcmp comparing null-terminated strings. There is no use of memcmp in the provided code. The only string comparison is strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0, which is the appropriate standard library function for comparing null-terminated strings and therefore not a violation of MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14. Other code constructs (metal_list_for_each, metal_container_of, the result pointer check and return statements) are unrelated to Rule 21.14 and do not involve memcmp-based string comparison, so they do not need to be investigated for this specific rule."
