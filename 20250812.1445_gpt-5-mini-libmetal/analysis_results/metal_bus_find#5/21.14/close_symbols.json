  "explanation": "- strcmp (declaration/definition or macro): The target uses strcmp; you must confirm this symbol is the standard strcmp and not a project macro/inline that is implemented using memcmp (which would violate the MISRA rule).\n- memcmp (declaration/definition or macro): Inspect memcmp to see whether strcmp (or any project string compare) is implemented on top of memcmp or if there are macro aliases mapping strcmp to memcmp.\n- struct metal_bus (full definition): You must know the type of the member name (e.g. char * vs. binary buffer) and whether it is documented/used as a null-terminated C string. The MISRA rule applies only when memcmp is used to compare null-terminated strings.\n- metal_container_of (macro/inline): Verify that metal_container_of yields a pointer to the expected struct metal_bus and that bus->name actually refers to the member you expect (no type punning that could change interpretation of the data).\n- metal_list_for_each (macro/inline): Inspect the traversal macro to ensure it does not alter or reinterpret the node memory in a way that affects whether name is a string (and to confirm normal list iteration semantics).\n- struct metal_list (definition): To understand the node layout and confirm that the list contains metal_bus objects as expected (so bus->name refers to a proper member of a bus object).\n- _metal and _metal.common.bus_list (definition/initialiser): To confirm what is stored in the list and how entries are added/initialised; this helps determine whether stored name fields are valid null-terminated strings.\n- metal_bus_register (and any code that initialises/assigns bus->name): This caller (and other registration/initialisation sites) is where bus->name is set. You must inspect those sites to confirm the name is a null-terminated string (if so, using memcmp on it would be a MISRA violation) and whether any compare helpers there use memcmp.\n- project headers that may redefine strcmp (e.g. included string wrapper headers): Some projects provide wrappers or macros that replace standard functions; check these headers to ensure strcmp is not replaced by an implementation that uses memcmp.\n\nCollectively these symbols let you determine (1) whether the code path actually compares null-terminated strings, and (2) whether strcmp (or a project alias) is implemented using memcmp. Both facts are required to decide if the MISRA rule is violated."
