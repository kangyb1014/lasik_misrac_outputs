  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_generic_dev_open uses any compiler language extensions, the analyzer must inspect the macros and types used inside it: \n- metal_list_for_each: this is a macro (or inline helper). Common implementations use GCC extensions (typeof, statement expressions). The macro definition must be checked for extensions.\n- metal_container_of: this macro frequently employs compiler extensions (typeof, GNU statement-expression) or tricky pointer arithmetic. Its definition is required to detect use of extensions.\n- struct metal_device: needed to inspect the types of members accessed (dev->name and dev->node). The member types and layout may influence how container_of is implemented or whether nonstandard constructs are used.\n- struct metal_list: required to examine the list node representation and whether iteration relies on extensions (e.g., container_of/for-each helpers expecting particular types).\n- _metal: the global instance referenced (_metal.common.generic_device_list) \u2014 its declaration/type must be examined to see if its definition uses extensions (designated initializers, compound literals, attributes, etc.).\n- type of _metal.common (definition of generic_device_list): to inspect how generic_device_list is declared/initialized and whether any nonstandard language features are used in its definition.\n- metal_generic_dev_sys_open (prototype): include its declaration to confirm it is a normal C function and that no extension (attribute syntax, inline asm in its signature) is being used when called.\n- strcmp (declaration): to ensure the standard library declaration is used and not shadowed by a nonstandard/extension variant.\n- ENODEV (errno macro): to confirm it is a standard errno macro and not redefined using extensions.\n- definitions of headers/macros that declare the above (e.g., the metal list/header files): the actual header files where the macros/types are defined must be checked because language extensions, attributes, or compiler-specific constructs are typically hidden there.\n\nInspecting these symbols and their definitions lets the next analyzer find any use of compiler-specific extensions (typeof, statement-expression ({...}), __attribute__, __asm__, __extension__, nonstandard macro tricks, etc.) that would violate the MISRA prohibition on language extensions."
