  "explanation": "Not enough evidence to call this a MISRA 8.13 violation. Rule 8.13 does recommend that pointers refer to const-qualified types when they are not used to modify the pointed-to object. In the snippet the bus parameter is not used (it is cast to void), so superficially it could be declared const. However, changing the parameter to const may not be possible: metal_generic_dev_open likely implements or overrides an API or function-pointer type whose signature requires struct metal_bus * (non-const). MISRA allows that a non-const pointer in such an interface is acceptable provided the reason is documented (or a deviation applied). The agent A did not show that this parameter is not constrained by an external API, nor provided a cross-reference proving the function could legally be changed to const. Therefore the report as given is not correct (insufficient justification). Recommendation: if the function is internal and not constrained by an external prototype, change the parameter to 'const struct metal_bus *bus' (or remove it) to satisfy the guideline; otherwise document/justify the deviation from MISRA 8.13."
