  "explanation": "I inspected the provided code fragments (metal_generic_dev_open and metal_generic_dev_sys_open) and found no use of memcmp. The only string comparison present is strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) which is the correct API for comparing null-terminated strings and therefore is not a violation of Rule 21.14. Other referenced items (metal_list_for_each, metal_container_of) are macros/constructs for list traversal and object access and are not shown to invoke memcmp in the provided snippets. No occurrences of the identifier \"memcmp\" appear in the supplied code, so there are no suspicious fragments to report with respect to MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
