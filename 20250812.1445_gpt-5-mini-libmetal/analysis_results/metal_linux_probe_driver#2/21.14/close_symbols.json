  "explanation": "sysfs_open_driver \u2014 The probe function calls sysfs_open_driver to locate a driver by name; its implementation may perform string comparisons. We must inspect it to see if it uses memcmp to compare null-terminated driver/name strings (which would trigger the MISRA rule). metal_log \u2014 The function logs formatted strings passed from the probe routine; although unlikely, its implementation could use memcmp on its string arguments. Include it to rule out indirect uses of memcmp. memcmp \u2014 The target MISRA rule is about use of memcmp on null-terminated strings; include the symbol so the analyzer can detect any direct or indirect calls to memcmp within the target function or functions it invokes. struct linux_driver (fields: mod_name, drv_name, sdrv) \u2014 We need the definition and types of mod_name and drv_name to know whether they are null-terminated strings (char* or char arrays). If they are null-terminated, use of memcmp to compare them would violate the rule; if they are length-known buffers, memcmp might be acceptable. struct linux_bus (field: bus_name) \u2014 To know the type/semantics of bus_name passed into sysfs_open_driver (is it a null-terminated string?). snprintf \u2014 The function is used to build the command string; include its prototype/implementation context so the analyzer can confirm it does not hide any memcmp-like string comparisons. system \u2014 The function is invoked to run commands; include to ensure no indirect memcmp use via wrapper implementations. These symbols are the minimal set needed to determine whether any memcmp usage affecting the probe routine exists, and whether such use would be operating on null-terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
