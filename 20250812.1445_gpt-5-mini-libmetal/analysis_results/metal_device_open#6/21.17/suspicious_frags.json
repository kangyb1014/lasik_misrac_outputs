  "explanation": "Other fragments do not need investigation for Rule 21.17 because they do not invoke or directly pass pointers into string.h functions within this function: the declarations (struct metal_bus *bus; int error;), the check for bus->ops.dev_open being non-NULL, the early returns that only propagate error codes, and the final return 0 statement contain no string handling and therefore cannot by themselves cause out-of-bounds accesses from <string.h>. The only places where string routines might be involved (calls that receive string pointers or direct calls to strlen) are included in the suspicious fragments above so they can be examined in context (including any downstream implementations invoked)."
