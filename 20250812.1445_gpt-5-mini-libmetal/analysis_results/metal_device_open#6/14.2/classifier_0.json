  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_device_open:\n```c\nint metal_device_open(const char *bus_name, const char *dev_name,\n\t\t      struct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\tint error;\n\n\tif (!bus_name || !strlen(bus_name) ||\n\t    !dev_name || !strlen(dev_name) ||\n\t    !device)\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\n\terror = metal_bus_find(bus_name, &bus);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\tif (!bus->ops.dev_open)\n\t\treturn -ENODEV;\n\n\terror = (*bus->ops.dev_open)(bus, dev_name, device);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_device_open:\nint metal_bus_find(const char *name, struct metal_bus **result)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.bus_list, node) {\n\t\tbus = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0 && result) {\n\t\t\t*result = bus;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn -ENOENT;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_bus {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_bus_ops\tops;\n\tstruct metal_list\tdevices;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\nmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.bus_list, node) {\n\t\tbus = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(bus->name, name) == 0 && result) {\n\t\t\t*result = bus;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 14.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The metal_list_for_each macro typically expands to: for (node = head->next; node != head; node = node->next) { ... }. The first clause initializes the single loop counter (node). The second clause is a simple test (node != head) with no persistent side-effects and only uses the loop counter and the list head (the head is not modified in the loop body). The third clause advances only the loop counter (node = node->next) and does not modify other objects used in the loop body. The loop counter (node) is not modified inside the body (only inspected), and the body\u2019s operations (strcmp, assignment to *result, return) do not violate the second/third clause requirements. Therefore, Rule 14.2 is not violated for this fragment."
