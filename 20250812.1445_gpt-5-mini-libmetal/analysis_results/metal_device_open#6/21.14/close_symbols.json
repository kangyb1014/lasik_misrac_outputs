  "explanation": "- strlen: The target calls strlen(bus_name) and strlen(dev_name); you must inspect the actual strlen declaration/semantics to confirm these are being used on NUL-terminated strings and to rule out any hidden memcmp usage or replacement.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule is specifically about use of memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings. Even though the target does not call memcmp directly, called code (metal_bus_find or dev_open callbacks) might. You must locate memcmp to see whether it is used anywhere in the call chain that compares bus_name or dev_name.\n- metal_bus_find: Called directly by the target. Its implementation may compare bus_name against stored names (potentially using memcmp) so it must be inspected for prohibited memcmp usage on NUL-terminated strings.\n- struct metal_bus (including ops and dev_open prototype): The target dereferences bus->ops.dev_open; you need the struct definition to know the dev_open prototype and how bus-related names are passed (e.g., whether dev_open receives NUL-terminated strings that it might compare erroneously with memcmp).\n- implementations of dev_open callbacks referenced by metal_bus.ops.dev_open: The call is indirect via a function pointer. Any concrete dev_open implementations reachable at runtime must be inspected because they may compare dev_name (or other NUL-terminated strings) using memcmp, which would violate the MISRA rule."
