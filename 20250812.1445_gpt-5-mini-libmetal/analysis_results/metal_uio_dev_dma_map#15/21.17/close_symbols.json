  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to assess memcpy safety against the MISRA rule:\n\n- struct metal_sg\n  - Needed to determine the size of each scatter/gather entry (sizeof(struct metal_sg)) used in the memcpy length calculation (nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg)). Also to know field types (virt, len) and their semantics for pointer arithmetic and bounds reasoning.\n\n- struct linux_device (including ldev->device, ldev->dev_name)\n  - The function indexes ldev->device.num_regions and accesses ldev->device.regions; knowing the concrete types and ranges is necessary to verify the earlier MMIO-range checks and ensure no undefined behavior affects later memcpy logic. dev_name is used in logging (helps trace call sites but not for memcpy correctness).\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - Contains virt and size used to check that each sg_in entry falls within a region. The exact types (pointer type, size field type) are needed to validate the pointer arithmetic (vaddr_lo + io->size) and confirm that those checks reliably prevent out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n- memcpy (from <string.h>)\n  - The semantics of memcpy (number of bytes copied, no overlap handling, required valid source/destination ranges) are central to applying the MISRA rule. We need the standard behavior to assess whether the byte-range passed could exceed source or destination object bounds.\n\n- sg_out allocation / capacity at each call site of metal_uio_dev_dma_map\n  - The function unconditionally copies nents_in entries into sg_out (when sg_out != sg_in). To determine whether memcpy may write past sg_out, the analyzer must know how large the destination buffer actually is in every caller (allocation size or declared length). This information is external to the function and is mandatory to judge safety.\n\n- call sites of metal_uio_dev_dma_map (to check passed sg_in, sg_out, nents_in and possible aliasing)\n  - To verify memcpy correctness you must inspect callers to see: how sg_in and sg_out were allocated/initialized, whether sg_out can equal sg_in (the function guards this but callers may rely on aliasing), and whether nents_in is validated by the caller. Caller context is required to prove absence of out-of-bounds reads/writes.\n\n- exact types of virt and len fields (in struct metal_sg and struct metal_io_region)\n  - The code performs pointer arithmetic (vaddr + len) and comparisons. If virt is not a byte-pointer type, or if len is signed/unsigned with different widths, arithmetic or comparison might overflow or be ill-typed. Exact types are required to reason about pointer range checks and to ensure they meaningfully constrain memory ranges before memcpy.\n\n- any compile-time limits or macros for SG counts (e.g. MAX_SG_ENTRIES or similar)\n  - If the codebase defines maximum allowed scatter/gather entries or validates nents_in elsewhere with known limits, those symbols help prove that the multiplication nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg) cannot overflow or exceed destination buffers.\n\nIn short: to decide if the memcpy call can violate the MISRA string-handling/bounds rule you must know the concrete layouts and sizes of struct metal_sg, the exact pointer/length field types, the destination buffer capacities (sg_out) at every call site, and the callers' usage/validation of nents_in. Without these symbols (definitions and call-site information) the memcpy usage cannot be proven safe."
