  "explanation": "For checking whether pointers in metal_uio_dev_dma_map can/should be const-qualified you must know the exact declarations of the objects and functions the code reads or passes to. Specifically:\n\n- struct metal_sg\n  - The function reads sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len and may pass sg_in to memcpy as the source. To determine whether sg_in can be declared const (e.g. const struct metal_sg *sg_in) you must know the types of its members (especially whether virt is void * or const void *). Assigning sg_in[i].virt into a non-const local vaddr_sg_lo would drop const if virt is const-qualified, so the member type is essential.\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - The function reads io->virt and io->size. To decide whether the io pointer (and by extension ldev->device.regions) could be const-qualified you must know whether io->virt is declared const void * (or void *). The pointer arithmetic and comparisons would behave differently with const-qualified members when the code assigns them to non-const local pointers.\n\n- struct linux_device (including nested .device.{regions,num_regions} and .dev_name)\n  - The code accesses ldev->device.regions and ldev->device.num_regions to iterate regions, and ldev->dev_name for logging. To determine if the ldev parameter itself could be a pointer to const (const struct linux_device *ldev) you must inspect these member types (is regions declared as pointer to mutable regions or pointer to const regions? is dev_name const char *?). If any member types are non-const or the code later needs to modify them, ldev cannot be const.\n\n- struct linux_bus\n  - The parameter lbus is currently unused ((void)lbus), but whether it could be declared const depends on its definition. Include its declaration to confirm no implicit modifications or API expectations prevent const.\n\n- memcpy prototype (from <string.h>)\n  - memcpy has the signature void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n). Knowing the exact prototype (that src is const) is important: it shows that sg_in can legally be a const source for memcpy. That supports qualifying sg_in as pointer-to-const if its element type permits it. Conversely, memcpy requires dest to be non-const, so sg_out cannot be const when it is used as destination.\n\nCollecting these symbols lets the next analyst determine whether any pointer parameters or struct members used only for reading in this function can be safely qualified with const without causing type mismatches (e.g. assignments into non-const locals) or breaking calls (memcpy destination must be non-const)."
