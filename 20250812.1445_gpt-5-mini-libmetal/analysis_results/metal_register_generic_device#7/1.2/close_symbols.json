  "explanation": "- struct metal_device (full definition): needed to inspect the types of device->name, device->num_regions, device->bus and device->node. The MISRA check must detect language extensions such as zero-length arrays (GCC extension), anonymous unions/structs, compiler-specific bit-field use, or other non-standard member declarations that could be hidden in the struct definition.\n- METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS (macro definition): the macro might be defined using compiler extensions (e.g. statement expressions, typeof(), or unusual token pasting) or non-standard constructs. Its definition is required to decide whether the comparison uses any language extension.\n- metal_generic_bus (declaration/definition and its type): the assignment device->bus = &metal_generic_bus must be checked for type compatibility and for any extension use in the initializer of metal_generic_bus (designated initializers, GNU extensions, __attribute__ annotations, compound literals, etc.).\n- _metal (declaration/definition and its type): the expression _metal.common.generic_device_list may rely on anonymous structs/unions or other non-standard layout/aliases. The type of _metal is needed to detect such extensions.\n- metal_list_add_tail (prototype/declaration): to verify that taking &device->node and passing it to metal_list_add_tail does not rely on non-standard pointer conversions or macros that expand to compiler extensions (e.g. GNU container_of using typeof())."
