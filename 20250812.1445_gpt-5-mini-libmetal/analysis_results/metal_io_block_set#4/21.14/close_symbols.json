  "explanation": "1) metal_io_virt: The target function calls metal_io_virt to obtain the pointer used for writes. To be sure the target function (directly) does not call memcmp or compare null-terminated strings via that call, the implementation of metal_io_virt must be inspected for any memcmp usage or for returning pointers that lead to indirect memcmp usage. \n\n2) definition of struct metal_io_region: The struct layout is needed to locate the ops field and to understand how block_set is provided. Knowing the fields and their types lets the analyst determine where function pointers come from and whether any embedded helpers call memcmp on strings. \n\n3) definition of the io->ops structure (the ops type that contains the block_set function pointer): The prototype and name of the ops struct is required to find all possible block_set implementations and to see whether any default/inline ops call memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\n4) all functions that can be assigned to io->ops.block_set (block_set implementations): The target function dispatches to io->ops.block_set when present. Any block_set implementation reachable at runtime must be inspected for use of memcmp on null-terminated strings; a violation could occur in those implementations even though metal_io_block_set itself does not call memcmp.\n\n5) memcmp and any project wrappers/aliases around memcmp (and locations where memcmp is called): To determine if the MISRA rule is violated anywhere reachable from the target function, the analyst must locate all calls to memcmp (including wrappers/aliases) in the codebase and determine whether any are used to compare null-terminated strings in the code paths reachable from metal_io_block_set (including block_set implementations and functions they call)."
