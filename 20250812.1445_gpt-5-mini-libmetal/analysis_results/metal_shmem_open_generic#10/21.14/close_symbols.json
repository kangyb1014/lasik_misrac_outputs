  "explanation": "- strcmp: The target uses strcmp to compare shmem->name and the input name. To check the MISRA rule we must inspect the actual strcmp implementation or any project wrapper to ensure it does not simply call memcmp when comparing null-terminated strings.\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule targets use of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings. Inspecting memcmp (and any local aliases/wrappers) is required to determine whether strcmp (or any project wrapper) ultimately uses memcmp for string comparison.\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: The code compares shmem->name to the input name. We must inspect the definition of this struct to determine the type and storage of name (e.g. char * vs char[]), and confirm that shmem->name is a null-terminated C string (so the MISRA rule would apply).\n- metal_container_of: This macro yields the shmem pointer from the list node. Its definition may affect the effective type of shmem (and therefore the interpretation of shmem->name); include it to ensure the recovered type is the expected struct metal_generic_shmem.\n- metal_list_for_each: Include this macro to confirm iteration semantics do not alter how shmem->name is obtained (e.g. any unusual casts or overlays). This is mainly for type-safety checking of the retrieved shmem pointer.\n- string.h (or project string wrapper/header that provides strcmp/memcmp declarations): The header may contain macros or project-specific wrappers/aliases that redefine strcmp or map it to memcmp (or to inline implementations). Inspecting the header(s) ensures there is no macro-level substitution that would make the use of strcmp violate the MISRA rule."
