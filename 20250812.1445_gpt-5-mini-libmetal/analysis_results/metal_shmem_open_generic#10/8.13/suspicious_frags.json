  "explanation": "The remaining code fragments do not introduce pointer types that could or should be const-qualified for the purposes of MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13: - The parameter 'name' is already const-qualified. - 'size' and the function return type are non-pointer scalar types, so Rule 8.13 does not apply. - The loop invocation 'metal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list, node)' is a macro invocation whose prototype and intent are not visible here; determining const-qualification for the loop control itself requires knowledge of that macro and the list API, so it is not flagged beyond the 'node' declaration above. - Simple control-flow statements (continue, return -ENOENT) and the comparison 'size <= metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io)' do not involve pointer declarations that could be made to point to const-qualified types. Therefore only the listed pointer-related declarations/usages need further investigation for compliance with Rule 8.13."
