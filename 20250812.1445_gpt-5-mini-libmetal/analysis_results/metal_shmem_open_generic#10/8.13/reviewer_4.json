  "explanation": "Not correct. MISRA Rule 8.13 (\u201cA pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible\u201d) advocates adding const where the object referenced is not intended to be modified, but it is a semantic recommendation that depends on the API intent. In this function the out-parameter returns the address of an existing struct metal_io_region (shmem->io) to the caller. That makes the pointee mutable by design (the caller is intended to receive a usable region), so marking the out-parameter as pointing-to-const is not necessarily possible or appropriate. There is no evidence in the code that the region must be immutable; changing the prototype to const struct metal_io_region ** would change the API and caller semantics. Therefore the agent A\u2019s blanket claim of a MISRA 8.13 violation is not justified. If the API should prohibit callers from modifying the region, then the signature should be changed to return a pointer-to-const (and the whole API adjusted accordingly), but as written the code does not demonstrably violate Rule 8.13."
