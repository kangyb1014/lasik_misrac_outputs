  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were identified in the provided function. Reasoning: the metal_list_for_each loop may iterate zero or more times \u2014 its body (including the if/continue and the nested if that can return 0) is reachable when the list has elements. The continue only affects loop flow and does not render subsequent code unreachable. The return 0 inside the conditional is a legitimate early exit; there is no code following that return within the same block that would be unreachable. The final return -ENOENT is reachable when the loop completes without finding a match. There are no labels, goto statements, dead statements after unconditional returns, or switch cases with unreachable fall-through in this fragment. Therefore no code in this snippet appears to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
