  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for MISRA C (a function parameter shall not be modified) analysis:\n\n- metal_list_for_each\n  - This macro drives the loop and may expand to statements that assign or update the loop iterator. We need its definition/expansion to confirm it only modifies the local iterator (node) and not any of the function parameters (name, size, result).\n\n- metal_container_of\n  - Usually a macro that computes the containing structure from a member pointer. Its expansion must be inspected to ensure it does not write through or reassign any of the function parameters (in particular the parameter 'result'). Also it establishes how 'shmem' is derived from 'node'.\n\n- _metal (specifically _metal.common.generic_shmem_list)\n  - The global list being iterated. Its type and how metal_list_for_each accesses it are needed to verify no aliasing/write to the function parameters occurs via the list object.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem\n  - Required to verify the types and members used: shmem->name, shmem->io, shmem->node. To determine the type of &shmem->io (to confirm the assignment *result = &shmem->io writes the object pointed-to by the parameter 'result' and does not attempt to modify the parameter pointer itself).\n\n- struct metal_list\n  - The iterator variable 'node' has this type; its definition/fields are needed to understand how the macros access container members and to check for any operations that might alias or modify function parameters.\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - Required to confirm the type of shmem->io and the type relationship with result (struct metal_io_region **). This ensures the assignment *result = &shmem->io modifies the object referred to by the pointer parameter (allowed) rather than the parameter itself (disallowed).\n\n- strcmp\n  - The function used to compare shmem->name and name. Its use must be checked to ensure it is not a non-standard macro or wrapper that could modify the 'name' parameter (which is const) or otherwise reassign parameters.\n\n- metal_io_region_size\n  - Although present in the static call graph, its signature/behavior should be checked to ensure it does not have side effects that could modify the function parameters (e.g., via aliasing). Also needed to confirm that calling it with &shmem->io cannot cause writes to 'result' or other parameters.\n\n- ENOENT\n  - The return macro/constant used. Not directly related to modification, but included so the next analysis agent has the full symbol context for the function's exit behavior.\n\nSummary: these symbols let the next agent inspect macros and types that determine whether the code reassigns or writes the parameter variables themselves (disallowed) versus writing the objects they point to (permitted)."
