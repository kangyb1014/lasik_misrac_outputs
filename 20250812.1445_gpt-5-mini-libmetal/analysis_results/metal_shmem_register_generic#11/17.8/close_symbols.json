  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule that a function parameter shall not be modified (the pointer itself must not be changed), the following symbols are needed:\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: Needed to know the exact layout/types of the pointed-to object (members name, io, node). Required to determine whether any expressions (shmem->name, shmem->io.ops.close, &shmem->node) could involve modifying the pointer itself vs. the object it points to.\n\n- metal_assert: Inspect the macro/function expansion to ensure it does not perform any assignments or side effects that could reassign the parameter variable 'shmem' (macros can sometimes introduce unexpected modifications).\n\n- strlen: Check that calling strlen(shmem->name) does not modify the pointer parameter (it should not, but verifying the standard/library or local replacement behaviour is necessary).\n\n- metal_list_add_tail: Must inspect the prototype/definition to verify it does not take a pointer-to-pointer or otherwise modify the 'shmem' pointer (we pass &shmem->node; ensure that is only used to modify the embedded node or list state, not to change the shmem parameter itself).\n\n- struct metal_list and struct metal_node: Needed to confirm that shmem->node is an embedded node object (so &shmem->node is an address into the object) and that operations on the node cannot legally/implicitly reassign the shmem pointer.\n\n- _metal: Definition (type of _metal.common.generic_shmem_list) is needed to ensure metal_list_add_tail usage targets a list object and that passing its address cannot cause any code path that reassigns the shmem parameter.\n\n- struct metal_io / metal_io_ops (io.ops.close): To verify the type of io.ops.close (function pointer) and that the assertion !shmem->io.ops.close is a pure read, not a macro or inline that could mutate the parameter.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyser confirm that only the object pointed to by 'shmem' (its fields/node) is accessed/modified and that the pointer parameter itself is never reassigned or modified by any called macro/function, satisfying the MISRA requirement."
