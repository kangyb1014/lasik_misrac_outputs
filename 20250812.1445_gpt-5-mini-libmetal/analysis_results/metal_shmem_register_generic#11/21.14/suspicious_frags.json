  "explanation": "No occurrences of the C standard library function memcmp are present in the provided code. The only string-related operation is strlen(shmem->name) != 0 which checks string length (not a memcmp comparison) and is not disallowed by Rule 21.14. The other operations (metal_assert macro expansion to metal_sys_assert, the check of shmem->io.ops.close, and metal_list_add_tail) do not perform string comparisons. The definition of metal_assert is provided but metal_sys_assert implementation is not present in the snippets; based on the given code there is no use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings, so there are no fragments to flag for investigation under Rule 21.14."
