  "explanation": "To determine whether metal_shmem_register_generic violates the MISRA rule banning use of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings you must inspect the code paths and types involved. Each listed symbol is required for the reasons below:\n\n- metal_assert: This macro/function evaluates the expressions in the asserts (shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0 and !shmem->io.ops.close). metal_assert\u2019s implementation might itself perform checks or call other helpers that could use memcmp; inspect it to ensure no memcmp-based string comparisons occur there.\n\n- strlen: The target calls strlen(shmem->name). Although standard strlen does not compare strings, the project may provide a custom strlen implementation (or wrapper) that could internally use memcmp incorrectly. You must examine strlen\u2019s implementation to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail: This function is called from the target. While unlikely to compare strings, its implementation must be checked to ensure it does not call memcmp (directly or indirectly) on shmem->name or other null-terminated strings.\n\n- metal_generic_shmem (struct/type definition): You need the definition of the struct to confirm the type and semantic of the name field (e.g., char * vs fixed-size array, whether it is documented/guaranteed to be a null-terminated C string). That determines whether any comparison of that field would qualify as a null-terminated string comparison under the MISRA rule.\n\n- memcmp: Include the memcmp symbol (its implementation/uses) so you can search for direct or indirect uses of memcmp in the above functions (and in any code they call). The MISRA rule is specifically about memcmp being used to compare null-terminated strings, so you must identify any memcmp calls and confirm whether their operands are null-terminated strings.\n\nInspecting these symbols (their implementations and call chains) is sufficient to determine whether the target function or any code it invokes violates the stated MISRA rule."
