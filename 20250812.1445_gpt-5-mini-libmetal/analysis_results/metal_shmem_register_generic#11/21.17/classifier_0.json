  "is_rule_violated": true,
  "scenario": "Yes. strlen(shmem->name) is called after only checking shmem->name is non-NULL; there is no guarantee the pointed object is NUL-terminated or that a NUL byte exists before the end of the object. For example, if shmem->name = buf where char buf[3] = {'A','B','C'} (no terminating '\\0'), strlen(shmem->name) will read past buf and may access out of bounds (undefined behavior). This can violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
