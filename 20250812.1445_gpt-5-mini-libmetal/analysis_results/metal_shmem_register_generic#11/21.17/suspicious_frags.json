  "explanation": "Only one call to a <string.h> function appears in the provided code: strlen in the metal_assert expression. All other lines do not call any string.h functions and therefore are not subject to Rule 21.17: \n- The struct member declaration (const char *name;) merely declares a pointer and does not invoke any string handling functions.\n- metal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close); does not use string functions.\n- metal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list, &shmem->node); does not use string functions.\nThere are no other uses of memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat/strlen/strspn in the provided code, so no additional fragments need investigation under Rule 21.17."
