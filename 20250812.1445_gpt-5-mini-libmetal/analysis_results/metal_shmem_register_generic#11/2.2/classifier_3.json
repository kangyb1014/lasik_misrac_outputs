  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_register_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_register_generic(struct metal_generic_shmem *shmem)\n{\n\t/* Make sure that we can be found. */\n\tmetal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0);\n\n\t/* Statically registered shmem regions cannot have a destructor. */\n\tmetal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close);\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list,\n\t\t\t    &shmem->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_shmem_register_generic:\n#define metal_assert(cond) metal_sys_assert(cond)\n</additional code>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code fragment that you need to analyze:\n```c\n\t/* Statically registered shmem regions cannot have a destructor. */\n\tmetal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close);\n\n```\nFocus on the above code fragment and judge whether it violates the rule 2.2 or not.\n</target_code>\n",

  "scenario": "The call metal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close) expands to metal_sys_assert(...) and performs a runtime check (potentially aborting or handling an error). This is an executed operation that can affect program behaviour if the condition fails, so it is not dead code. (It would only be dead code if metal_sys_assert were a no-op and the condition were provably always true \u2014 neither of which is established by the provided code.)"
