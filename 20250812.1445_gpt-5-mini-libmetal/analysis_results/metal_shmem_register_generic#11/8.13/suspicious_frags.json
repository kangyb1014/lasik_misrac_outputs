  "explanation": "No code fragments require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer parameter in the function is 'struct metal_generic_shmem *shmem'. It cannot be made a pointer-to-const because the function passes '&shmem->node' to metal_list_add_tail, which will modify the node fields (linking the node into the global list), so the pointee must be mutable. The member 'name' is already declared as 'const char *', satisfying const qualification for that pointer. The access to 'shmem->io.ops.close' is read-only (used only in an assertion), but since the overall structure must remain non-const because of the node modification, making parts const is not applicable here. No other pointer variables appear in the provided code that could be const-qualified."
