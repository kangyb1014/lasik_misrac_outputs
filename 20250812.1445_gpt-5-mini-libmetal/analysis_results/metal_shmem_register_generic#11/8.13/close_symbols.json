  "explanation": "To decide whether pointers in metal_shmem_register_generic should be const-qualified you must know which objects are read-only and which are modified by this function (or by callees). Each listed symbol is required for that determination:\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: The full definition of the struct is needed to see which fields are mutable and their types; you cannot mark the incoming pointer as pointing to const if any field the function (or its callees) modifies is non-const.\n\n- metal_generic_shmem.name (field type): The type of the name field (char * vs const char *) determines whether the string pointer inside the struct is already const-qualified or could/should be declared const.\n\n- metal_generic_shmem.io (field type) / io.ops.close (field type): The type of the io/ops.close function pointer is needed to see whether those pointers are to mutable data or function pointers; the code asserts close is NULL, but the field's type affects const-qualification decisions for nested pointers.\n\n- metal_generic_shmem.node (field type): The node field is passed to metal_list_add_tail; you must know its type to determine whether the function mutates the object via that field (which would prevent making the whole shmem pointer const).\n\n- struct metal_list (type of generic_shmem_list / node): The list/node type and its semantics tell you whether metal_list_add_tail modifies the node or list structure (and therefore whether the object behind shmem must be mutable).\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (prototype): You must inspect this callee's parameter types (const vs non-const) and whether it mutates the passed node/list. If it takes non-const pointers and modifies node/list, shmem cannot be const-qualified.\n\n- _metal (global) and _metal.common.generic_shmem_list (type): The type of the global list argument confirms whether adding to the global list requires mutable access; it also helps determine if any constness constraints propagate from that object.\n\n- metal_assert (macro/function prototype): To confirm that the assertions do not perform mutations or require non-const arguments (and to ensure they don't change const-qualification analysis).\n\n- strlen (prototype from <string.h>): strlen takes a const char *; knowing its prototype verifies whether passing shmem->name to strlen would require/benefit from const qualification of that field.\n\nUsing these symbols you can determine which fields are only read (and therefore could be const) and which are written (preventing const qualification of the pointer to the containing struct)."
