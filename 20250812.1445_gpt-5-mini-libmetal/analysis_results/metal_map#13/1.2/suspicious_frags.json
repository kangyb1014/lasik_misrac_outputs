  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code fragment. The function uses standard C syntax and POSIX API calls/macros (mmap, PROT_*, MAP_*, MAP_FAILED, flock, fstat, ftruncate, errno, off_t, size_t, struct stat), which are OS/library features rather than compiler language extensions. There are no occurrences of known compiler-specific language extensions such as __attribute__ or __declspec, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, inline assembler (asm), labels-as-values (&label), GCC statement-expression or sizeof on VLA in an extension-only way, zero-length arrays, or other constructs explicitly documented as compiler extensions. The mixed declaration-and-code inside the block (off_t reqsize = ...; struct stat stat;) is standard C (C99 and later) rather than a compiler extension. Therefore there are no fragments to flag for MISRA C:2023 Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
