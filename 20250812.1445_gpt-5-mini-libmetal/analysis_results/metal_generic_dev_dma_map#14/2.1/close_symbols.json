  "explanation": "- METAL_DMA_DEV_W: The branch if (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) controls execution of metal_cache_flush. To decide if that branch (or its complement) is unreachable you must know the exact value/definition of this symbol.  \n- Other METAL_DMA_DEV_* direction constants / the DMA direction enum type: You need the full set/type of valid dir values to determine whether dir can ever equal METAL_DMA_DEV_W for any caller or whether the comparison is tautologically true/false.  \n- struct metal_sg (definition: members virt and len): The loop body and the memcpy size depend on the structure layout and the existence of virt/len members; knowing the structure ensures the code inside the loop is meaningful and whether sizeof(struct metal_sg) is non\u2011zero.  \n- sizeof(struct metal_sg) (or the compiled size): If the size were somehow zero (theoretical/configuration issues) the memcpy length and loop semantics would be affected; the size confirms whether the memcpy can be a no\u2011op or not.  \n- memcpy (declaration/definition or macro replacement): If memcpy is replaced by a macro/function that alters control flow (or is a no\u2011op in this build) that could make the memcpy call or later statements unreachable; the concrete definition is required.  \n- metal_cache_flush (declaration/definition and any attributes, e.g. noreturn): If this function has attributes that prevent return (e.g. noreturn, longjmp/exit inside) or is conditionally compiled out, it would affect reachability of subsequent statements in the loop and overall function.  \n- metal_cache_invalidate (declaration/definition and any attributes, e.g. noreturn): Same reasoning as metal_cache_flush \u2014 a non\u2011returning implementation would make code after its call unreachable; its definition/attributes are needed.  \n- All call sites of metal_generic_dev_dma_map and their argument/value constraints (values or invariants for dir, nents_in, sg_in, sg_out): MISRA unreachable\u2011code analysis must consider how the function is used across the project. If every caller passes e.g. nents_in==0 or a fixed dir value, some branches/loop body may be unreachable in practice. Provide callers and any documented/contracts on parameter ranges so reachability can be decided."
