Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code..\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of metal_generic_dev_dma_map.\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_dma_map(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t     uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t     int nents_in,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_out)\n{\n\tint i;\n\t(void)bus;\n\t(void)device;\n\n\tif (sg_out != sg_in)\n\t\tmemcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg)));\n\tfor (i = 0; i < nents_in; i++) {\n\t\tif (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) {\n\t\t\tmetal_cache_flush(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetal_cache_invalidate(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t}\n\n\treturn nents_in;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:The expression-statement \u201c(void)device;\u201d evaluates the parameter without any side-effect solely to suppress an 'unused parameter' warning.

  "explanation": "The agent's literal interpretation is too strict: the statement \u201c(void)device;\u201d is the common, intentional idiom to mark a parameter as used solely to suppress an unused-parameter diagnostic. In practice it has no runtime effect and removing it normally does not change program behaviour, but MISRA usage and coding practice treat this as an explicit, documented no-op to express intent (and many MISRA-compliant coding standards explicitly allow this idiom or provide an approved macro for it). Thus the report that this specific line is a Rule 2.2 violation is not correct in context. If a project wants to avoid even this form it should remove the unused parameter or use an approved annotation/macro, but the presence of \u201c(void)device;\u201d by itself should not be reported as a dead-code violation in typical MISRA C reviews."
