  "explanation": "To decide whether the memcpy call copies beyond the bounds of the source or destination objects you must know: (1) the exact memory footprint per entry \u2014 so the full definition of struct metal_sg (fields, types, and any packing) to compute sizeof(struct metal_sg) and to verify subsequent indexed accesses (sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len) are valid; (2) the memcpy prototype (from <string.h>) so you know the third argument is a byte count (size_t) and how conversions/overflows behave; (3) the actual call sites of metal_generic_dev_dma_map and the code that prepares/allocates sg_in and sg_out so you can determine the allocated lengths of the buffers these pointers reference (the static function body alone cannot prove buffer sizes); (4) any documented or coded constraints on nents_in (maximum/minimum allowed entries) or related constants (e.g. METAL_MAX_SG) so you can check the relation between nents_in and the allocated array lengths; (5) platform integer and size semantics (width of size_t, sizeof pointers, INT_MAX) to detect potential integer overflow in the multiplication nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg) or incorrect conversions that could truncate the byte count passed to memcpy; and (6) any packing/attribute annotations that change sizeof(struct metal_sg). Without these symbols/definitions you cannot conclusively determine whether memcpy accesses are within the bounds of the source and destination objects, which is required to assess compliance with the cited MISRA C rule."
