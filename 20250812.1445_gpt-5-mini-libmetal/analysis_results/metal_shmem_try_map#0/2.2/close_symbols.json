  "explanation": "Brief justification for including each symbol when assessing dead-code (MISRA) in metal_shmem_try_map:\n\n- metal_align_up\n  - Computes the rounded-up size and therefore the number of pages. If this always returns the same value as size for the platform, some size- or page-dependent code paths could be dead. Needed to determine reachability of branches that depend on pages/size.\n\n- metal_map\n  - Called at the start and its return controls an early return on error. If metal_map can never fail (or always fails) on target platforms, subsequent code becomes dead or unreachable. Must know its possible outcomes/side-effects.\n\n- metal_unmap\n  - Used to unwind on allocation/map failures. If it is a no-op or always fails/has side-effects, that affects whether the cleanup code is required or removable.\n\n- metal_log\n  - Produces observable side-effects (logging). Whether logging is considered part of program behaviour matters for dead-code determination: removing a log call might change behaviour. Need its semantics (e.g., side-effects, conditional compilation) to decide if log calls are dead.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING\n  - The log level/token passed to metal_log; required to understand whether those particular log calls are active/compiled out on the target.\n\n- strerror\n  - Used to produce messages in the log; if strerror has side-effects or is stubbed out/always returns the same string in the environment, that affects whether the call and surrounding log are dead.\n\n- mlock\n  - Called but its error is ignored (no early return). To decide if the mlock call (and its associated log) is dead, we must know if mlock has any observable/required side-effects on the platform.\n\n- errno\n  - Used after mlock failure to form the log message. Its value and whether mlock sets it determine whether the log call is meaningful or removable.\n\n- malloc\n  - Allocates phys and io. If malloc can be treated as always-successful or always-fails in the environment, then the error branches (cleanup and returns) could be dead or required. Need allocator semantics.\n\n- free\n  - Used in cleanup when io allocation fails. If free is a no-op or has side-effects, that affects whether the cleanup sequence is required.\n\n- ENOMEM\n  - Error code returned on allocation failure. If ENOMEM is never used/meaningful in the environment, the error-return branches may be considered dead.\n\n- _metal (pagemap_fd)\n  - Global used to select between two initialization branches. If _metal.pagemap_fd is provably always <0 or always >=0 on the target, one branch (the loop calling metal_virt2phys or the single phys[0]=0 branch) would be dead. Knowing its runtime/static range is essential.\n\n- metal_virt2phys\n  - Called in the per-page loop when a pagemap is present. If this always fails/succeeds or is a no-op, the loop or its error handling may be dead. Also needed to see whether writes to phys[page] are meaningful.\n\n- METAL_BAD_OFFSET\n  - Value assigned on per-page conversion failure. If this constant equals some default already produced, or if its usage is never observed, assignments could be dead; needed to reason about observable effects.\n\n- metal_shmem_io_ops\n  - Passed to metal_io_init; its contents (callbacks) determine observable behaviour of the initialized io region. If those ops are no-ops, some initialization may be unnecessary.\n\n- metal_io_init\n  - Finalizes the io region. If this is a no-op or has side-effects relied upon later, removing the calls may change behaviour. Also used in both branches; needed to see whether one branch is redundant.\n\n- struct metal_page_size (page_size, mmap_flags, page_shift)\n  - The function depends on these fields to compute alignment, mmap flags and to pass page_shift. If these fields are statically fixed such that some calculations/parameters are redundant, parts of the code may be dead.\n\n- struct metal_io_region (type/layout)\n  - Understanding what metal_io_init/populated fields do and whether populating phys/virt/mem sizes is required depends on the layout and semantics of the io region type. Needed to see if assignments/initialization are necessary.\n\n- metal_phys_addr_t (type/size)\n  - Size and representation affect malloc size and whether phys assignments (phys[0]=0, phys[page]=METAL_BAD_OFFSET) have observable effects. Also relevant to determine whether a single phys entry vs array matters.\n\nThese symbols collectively determine reachability, side-effects, and observability of the function's operations. For a correct MISRA dead-code assessment you must know whether calls/assignments/logging alter program behaviour on the target platform or are effectively no-ops; the listed symbols supply that semantic information."
