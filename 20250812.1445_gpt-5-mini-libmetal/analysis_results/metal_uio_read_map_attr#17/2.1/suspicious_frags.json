  "explanation": "I selected the fragments that cover all control-flow points where execution might be prevented from reaching later statements: the snprintf result check (possible early return), the sysfs open/read failure branch (early return and a call with a potentially NULL attr), the value conversion from the attribute contents, and the final close/return sequence. Other parts of the function do not present plausible unreachable-code concerns: the declarations and the cls assignment are simple initializations and always reachable; the path buffer definition is a static allocation and not control flow; there are no constant conditionals, infinite loops, or dead-code constructs elsewhere in the function. The listed fragments therefore cover the only locations that could cause or mask unreachable code and should be investigated further for Rule 2.1 compliance."
