  "explanation": "No calls to the Standard Library string.h functions listed in MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 (e.g. memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) are present in the provided function. The only string-related operations are snprintf (from <stdio.h>) and strtoul; snprintf usage includes a bounds check (result >= sizeof(path)) to detect truncation/overflow, and strtoul only reads from attr->value (no string.h copying or concatenation). Therefore there are no direct uses of the <string.h> routines that would need investigation under Rule 21.17. (Note: other potential issues in the code\u2014such as calling sysfs_close_attribute(attr) when attr is NULL or checking snprintf return value for negative errors\u2014are outside the scope of Rule 21.17 and so are not listed as suspicious for this rule.)"
