  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found relevant to MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. The only pointer in the function is the parameter 'const char *path', which is already const-qualified and is only used for read-only operations (strlen, and passed unchanged to shm_open/open whose prototypes accept const char *). There are no other pointer variables or pointer-to-non-const uses in the function. Other identifiers (flags, mode, fd) are non-pointer types and thus not subject to this rule."
