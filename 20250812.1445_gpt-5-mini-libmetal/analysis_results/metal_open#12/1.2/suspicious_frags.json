  "explanation": "No compiler language extensions are used in the provided code. The code only uses standard C constructs (constant int declarations, conditional operator, function calls, pointer checks, return expressions). Identifiers and APIs present (open, shm_open, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, O_CLOEXEC, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, errno, EINVAL, strlen) are either standard C library functions/macros or POSIX/platform APIs \u2014 these are platform/library features, not compiler language extensions. There are no vendor-specific language features (for example GCC nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, asm blocks, attribute syntaxes, or other documented compiler extensions) present in the snippet, so nothing requires investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2."
