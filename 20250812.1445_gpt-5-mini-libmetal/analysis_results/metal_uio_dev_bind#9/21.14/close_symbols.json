  "explanation": "Explainers for each required symbol:\n- strcmp: The target calls strcmp. Some C library or project implementations of strcmp may be thin wrappers around memcmp; to determine whether memcmp is being used to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect strcmp's implementation or prototype.\n- strlen: Target calls strlen. While strlen itself does not compare strings, its implementation or use may affect whether memcmp is used elsewhere; include to see if any indirect use of memcmp occurs when handling string lengths.\n- sysfs_get_device_attr: The function returns attributes and may internally compare attribute names or strings; its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings.\n- sysfs_get_driver_attr: Same reason as sysfs_get_device_attr \u2014 it may compare attribute names/strings internally; inspect implementation for memcmp usage.\n- sysfs_write_attribute: This writes attributes using given string data; implementations may perform string comparisons (e.g., to validate input) and could (incorrectly) use memcmp on null-terminated strings \u2014 its implementation must be checked.\n- metal_log: Logging routines are unlikely to compare strings, but include its implementation to be sure no hidden memcmp usage exists in formatting/helpers used here.\n- errno (extern): The target returns -errno on failures; include errno to understand error-path behavior but mainly to locate any library calls that might set errno after calls that could use memcmp.\n- SYSFS_UNKNOWN (macro): The code compares driver_name to SYSFS_UNKNOWN with strcmp \u2014 confirm SYSFS_UNKNOWN is indeed a string literal (null-terminated) and not e.g. a sentinel value that would change how comparisons are done.\n- struct linux_device (definition): To confirm types of fields (dev_name, sdev, override) and to verify that dev_name is a null-terminated string (so any comparison involving it could be subject to the MISRA rule).\n- struct linux_driver (definition): To confirm drv_name is a null-terminated string and to see sdrv field used to fetch attributes; makes it possible to trace where string data originates.\n- definition of ldev->sdev type (the struct that contains driver_name): To confirm driver_name is a null-terminated string and determine whether comparisons involving it are string-based.\n- struct sysfs_attribute (definition): To understand how attributes are represented and whether any attribute handling routines might use memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\nCollecting these symbols/definitions and inspecting the implementations will allow determination of whether any called or wrapper functions use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings (thus violating the MISRA rule)."
