  "explanation": "MISRA Rule 21.17 concerns functions from <string.h> (e.g. strlen) and any code that uses their results to size or access buffers. The three strlen calls and the subsequent use of their result to allocate and populate reply, plus the creation of a response using slen as the buffer length, should be investigated together for possible out-of-bounds or null-pointer access (e.g. session->value_1 or session->value_2 being NULL or not NUL-terminated, and mismatches between allocated size and actual produced data). Other fragments in the function do not need investigation under Rule 21.17: (void) cls; variable declarations; the NULL check on reply and the free(reply) path; add_session_cookie, MHD_add_response_header, fprintf, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response, and the use of free as the free-callback are not calls from <string.h> and do not themselves perform string handling that could read beyond object bounds. Likewise, basic memory allocation (malloc) by itself is not a <string.h> function (the issue is how its size is computed, which is already included above)."
