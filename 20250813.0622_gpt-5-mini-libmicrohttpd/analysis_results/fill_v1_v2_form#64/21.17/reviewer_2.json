For example, if session->value_1 was filled with strncpy without ensuring a terminating '\\0' (or came from an external input that didn't include a terminator), strlen(session->value_1) will read past the object\u2019s bounds until a 0 byte is found (undefined behavior). strlen(NULL) similarly dereferences an invalid pointer. The literal SECOND_PAGE is safe (NUL-terminated), but the session fields make this fragment susceptible to out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\n\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nfill_v1_v2_form (const void *cls,\n                 const char *mime,\n                 struct Session *session,\n                 struct MHD_Connection *connection)\n{\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n  char *reply;\n  struct MHD_Response *response;\n  size_t slen;\n  (void) cls; /* Unused.

  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct in the absence of additional, external guarantees. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 forbids calling the string-handling functions in a way that can read beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. In the shown function there are direct calls to strlen(session->value_1) and strlen(session->value_2) without any checks that (a) session is non-NULL, (b) the value_1/value_2 pointers are non-NULL, or (c) the pointed-to objects are NUL-terminated and bounded. If any of those pointers are NULL or if the buffers are not NUL-terminated (for example, if they were populated with strncpy without guaranteeing a terminator), then strlen can read past the object bounds (or dereference NULL) \u2014 precisely the behaviour Rule 21.17 forbids.\n\nIf there is a separate, provable invariant (e.g. struct Session fields are fixed-size arrays that are always initialized to contain a terminating '\\0', or callers always ensure non-NULL, NUL-terminated strings) then the calls could be compliant. But nothing in the provided snippet enforces or documents that invariant, so the reported violation is valid. Recommended fixes: check for NULL, ensure NUL-termination on writes, or use bounded alternatives (e.g. strnlen with the known maximum buffer size) and document/verify preconditions."
