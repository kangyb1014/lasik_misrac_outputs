  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The statement \u201c(void) cls;\u201d is an intentional no-op used to document and silence an \"unused parameter\" diagnostic; it has no program-state side effects but its presence is a deliberate annotation, not an oversight. MISRA Rule 2.2 targets genuinely useless code whose removal would not affect program behaviour; in practice the cast-to-void is an accepted idiom to indicate an unused parameter and to avoid diagnostics. The modified test harness and empty log do not change this fact. Therefore claiming that this specific statement constitutes a Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
