  "explanation": "To decide whether this function can cause out\u2011of\u2011bounds accesses via string.h functions you must examine everything this function references or might expand to. Provide:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: needed to know the exact types of flags_auto, flags and total_size and whether any of those members are (or alias) pointers to buffers that could be passed to string functions (directly or via macros/inline helpers). The field types determine whether bitwise checks and the head/length checks are well\u2011typed and whether any pointer arithmetic or implicit conversions occur.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseFlags: the complete enumeration and underlying integer type are required to ensure the flag tests and assignments do not rely on macros or expressions that call string functions or perform pointer/size conversions that could lead to out\u2011of\u2011bounds memory accesses.\n\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions (including MHD_RO_END): the variadic loop uses va_arg to fetch values of this enum; you must know the exact values/types and sentinel (MHD_RO_END) to confirm the va_arg usage is correct and that the variadic protocol does not actually carry pointer/string arguments that might be passed to string.h functions elsewhere.\n\n- enum MHD_Result (MHD_YES, MHD_NO): the return values and their definitions are needed to understand any macros/inline conversions used for results (in case these macros expand to expressions that use string functions).\n\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE, MHD_RO_END, MHD_YES, MHD_NO: the concrete definitions (macros or constants) are needed to check whether any of these are implemented as expressions, function\u2011like macros, or wrappers that might invoke string.h functions or perform unsafe pointer/size manipulations when evaluated.\n\nIn short: supply the full definitions of the struct, the enums and the flag/sentinel constants so the analyzer can verify (1) no macros expand to string.h calls, (2) no pointer/buffer members are indirectly used with string functions, and (3) the variadic handling cannot cause mismatched types that lead to subsequent unsafe string operations."
