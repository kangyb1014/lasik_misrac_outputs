  "explanation": "For determining whether the function should use const-qualified pointers (MISRA: pointer should point to const when possible) we must know whether the function actually mutates the object pointed to and whether any involved members or constants impose or expect constness. Required symbols and why:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: the full definition is needed to see if the function writes any of its members (which prevents making the pointer-to-struct const) and to find any nested pointer members that themselves may or may not require const qualification.\n- struct MHD_Response::flags_auto, ::flags, ::total_size: these specific members are read or written by the function. We must know each member's declared type and qualifiers (e.g. whether any are declared const) to decide if the pointer parameter could have been declared const.\n- enum MHD_Result: the return type (and its constants) must be known to ensure no hidden pointer/const interactions influence the analysis (e.g. if MHD_YES/MHD_NO were macros expanding to pointers \u2014 unlikely but must be checked).\n- enum MHD_ResponseFlags: the declared type of flags values (and whether any members are pointer types or const-qualified) must be inspected to ensure bitwise tests/assignments do not involve pointers that would change const reasoning.\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions and MHD_RO_END: va_arg reads values of this enum; confirm that the varargs/enum usage does not involve pointer types that affect const correctness.\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH, MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE: these flag macros/constants are used in tests and affect control flow; verify they are integer constants (not pointer expressions) and do not imply any constness requirements on struct members.\n- MHD_YES, MHD_NO: verify these result constants are scalar enum/integer values and not pointer-like macros which could affect const analysis.\n\nIn short: the struct definition and the exact declarations/qualifiers of the members the function reads/writes are essential; the enums and flag constants must be checked to ensure they are scalar (not pointer) and don't change the const-qualification reasoning."
