  "explanation": "To determine whether the function modifies its parameters (MISRA: a function parameter shall not be modified) the analyser must know the concrete definitions and semantics of the identifiers that appear to read from or write to the parameters:\n\n- struct MHD_Response: need the full struct definition to know whether any access like response->flags_auto, response->flags or response->total_size is actually writing to the pointer itself (impossible) or to members (allowed). Also to confirm none of these members are implemented via macros or accessor functions that could alter the pointer parameter.\n- struct MHD_Response::flags_auto, ::flags, ::total_size: explicit member declarations/types are required to confirm that the assignment response->flags = flags modifies the object pointed to (permitted) and not the pointer parameter itself (forbidden).\n- enum MHD_ResponseFlags: the type of the 'flags' parameter; needed to check whether any of the symbolic flag names are implemented as expressions or macros with side effects that could modify the 'flags' parameter rather than just being constants.\n- MHD_RF_INSANITY_HEADER_CONTENT_LENGTH and MHD_RF_HEAD_ONLY_RESPONSE: these symbols are used in bitwise expressions involving the parameter 'flags' and response->flags. The analyser must see their definitions to ensure they are simple constants (no side effects) and to understand the bit tests performed (they do not assign to 'flags').\n- MHD_RAF_HAS_CONTENT_LENGTH: used against response->flags_auto; its definition is needed to ensure no unexpected side effects are hidden there.\n- enum MHD_ResponseOptions and MHD_RO_END: needed because the varargs loop reads enum MHD_ResponseOptions values with va_arg; the analyser must confirm MHD_RO_END is a constant sentinel and that the va_arg usage does not modify the named fixed parameter 'flags'.\n- enum MHD_Result and MHD_YES / MHD_NO: return values; while not directly about parameter modification, their definitions can show whether any macros expand to code that might modify parameters (unlikely but must be checked if they are macros rather than plain enum constants).\n- va_start / va_arg / va_end (from <stdarg.h>): the definitions/macros for these must be available to confirm that va_start(ap, flags) and subsequent va_arg usage do not in some platform-specific implementation modify the local parameter 'flags' (they should not, but the analyser must be able to inspect the implementation or assume standard behavior).\n\nIn short: the struct and its members and all symbolic flag/option/result constants (and the stdarg macros) are required to prove whether any code or macro expansion inside this function actually assigns to the parameter 'flags' or reassigns the pointer 'response' itself. All of the listed symbols let the analyser verify there are no hidden side effects that would violate the MISRA rule."
