  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n- sysconf (declaration/implementation, typically in <unistd.h>): The function calls sysconf when the conditional macros are set. To determine whether the target function (directly or indirectly) uses any <string.h> routines or performs out\u2011of\u2011bounds memory accesses, you must inspect the actual declaration/implementation (or any project-specific wrapper/macro) of sysconf. If sysconf is a macro or wraps project code, that code could call string functions; if sysconf is the system call wrapper, it does not introduce string handling here. Knowing the exact sysconf symbol removes uncertainty about indirect string.h usage.\n- _SC_CRAY_NCPU (macro value): This macro is passed to sysconf in one compilation branch. Its definition or presence can affect which branch is compiled and whether sysconf is invoked. Also verify it does not expand to any code that could use string functions.\n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF (macro value): Same reasons as _SC_CRAY_NCPU \u2014 it controls which sysconf name is used and whether the branch is active; its definition must be known to rule out indirect string usage.\n- HAVE_SYSCONF (configuration macro): Controls whether the entire sysconf-based block is compiled. You must know whether this macro is defined to know if sysconf is actually invoked in the built binary (and thus whether any indirect string operations from sysconf matter).\n- HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU (configuration macro): Controls the inclusion of the branch that calls sysconf with _SC_CRAY_NCPU. Needed to determine which branches are compiled and whether sysconf will be used.\n- HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF (configuration macro): Controls the inclusion of the branch that calls sysconf with _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF. Needed for the same reasons as above.\n\nRationale summary: The MISRA rule in question concerns use of <string.h> functions. The target function body contains no direct calls to any string.h functions; therefore the only way it could violate the rule is via an indirect call (e.g., through sysconf) or via macros that expand to code invoking string functions. The symbols above are exactly those that can enable/define that indirect code path or are the direct call target; examine their declarations/definitions to conclude whether any string.h routines could be executed as part of this function."
