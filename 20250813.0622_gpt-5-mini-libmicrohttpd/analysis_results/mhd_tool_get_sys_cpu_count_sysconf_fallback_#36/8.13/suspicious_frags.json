  "explanation": "No pointer usage exists in the provided function. The code declares only scalar variables (int ret; long value), uses the sysconf call which returns a long by value, performs integer casts and comparisons, and contains preprocessor conditionals. There are no pointer declarations, no pointer parameters or return types, no address-of (&) or indirection (*) operations, and no pointer casts that could implicate const qualification. Therefore MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 (pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible) is not applicable to any fragment of this function; no fragments need investigation for this rule."
