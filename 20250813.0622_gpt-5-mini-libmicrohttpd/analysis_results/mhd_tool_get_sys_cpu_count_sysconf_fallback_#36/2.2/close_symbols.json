  "explanation": "HAVE_SYSCONF \u2014 This preprocessor symbol controls whether the entire sysconf-based block is compiled in. To decide if any statements inside are dead, you must know if this #if is true at compile time. HAS_DECL__SC_CRAY_NCPU \u2014 Controls inclusion of the branch that calls sysconf(_SC_CRAY_NCPU). If undefined, that call and its guarded statements are not present and cannot be executed. HAS_DECL__SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF \u2014 Controls inclusion of the branch that calls sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF). If undefined, that call and its guarded statements are not present and cannot be executed. _SC_CRAY_NCPU \u2014 The constant passed to sysconf in the first guarded call; its availability/definition (and value) is part of whether that call is meaningful or compiled. _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF \u2014 The constant passed to sysconf in the second guarded call; same rationale as above. sysconf \u2014 The runtime function invoked from this code. Its prototype and runtime semantics (possible return values, error behavior) determine whether the assignments and overflow checks in the function can affect program behaviour (i.e., whether those operations are effective or effectively no-ops). mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count \u2014 The caller of the target function. To determine if the target function itself (or parts of it) are dead you must know whether and under what conditions its caller invokes it. mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_special_api_, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_, mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count, mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_fallback_ \u2014 These sibling implementations are called by mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count; the caller may select between them conditionally. Inspecting these symbols is required to decide whether the sysconf_fallback implementation is ever chosen (so that its code is live) or never chosen (which could make it dead code). detect_cpu_core_count \u2014 The higher-level caller of mhd_tool_get_system_cpu_count. To prove that the target function (or its operations) can affect program behaviour you may need to trace reachability up to entry points; this symbol is the next known caller in the chain and is required to establish whether the whole call path is used."
