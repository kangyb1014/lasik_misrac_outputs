  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for language-extension use:\n\n- sysctlbyname: The function is called when HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME is set. Its declaration/definition must be inspected to ensure it is not a compiler-specific extension (for example a macro or an implementation that uses compiler-only keywords/attributes).\n\n- sysctl: Same as sysctlbyname \u2014 the call may resolve to an implementation that uses compiler extensions (macros, attributes, builtin helpers). Inspecting its declaration/definition and header lets you detect any nonstandard compiler extensions.\n\n- CTL_HW: This is a preprocessor macro used to form the mib array. Macros can hide compiler-specific constructs; you must know its definition (from system headers) to ensure it does not expand to an extension.\n\n- HW_NCPU: Same rationale as CTL_HW \u2014 check its macro definition in system headers to ensure no compiler-specific extensions are used.\n\n- __linux__: This predefined macro controls conditional compilation. You must know whether the compiler treats it as a standard predefined macro or as a documented compiler extension for the target compilers (to rule out extension usage tied to predefined macros).\n\n- HAVE_SYSCTLBYNAME: Build-time feature macro gating the sysctlbyname call. You need its presence/absence to determine which code path is active and therefore which external symbols/headers must be inspected for extensions.\n\n- HAVE_SYSCTL: Build-time macro gating the sysctl call. Required to know whether the code path using sysctl is compiled and must be checked for extensions.\n\n- HAS_DECL_CTL_HW: Build-time macro indicating whether CTL_HW is declared. Needed to determine if the CTL_HW macro definition (and possible extension usage) is relevant.\n\n- HAS_DECL_HW_NCPU: Build-time macro indicating whether HW_NCPU is declared. Same reason as HAS_DECL_CTL_HW.\n\n- size_t: The type is used for value_size; its typedef/definition (from stddef.h or headers) should be checked only to ensure no compiler-specific typedefs or extensions are used (very unlikely but necessary for a complete MISRA extension check).\n\n- NULL: The macro is used as an argument; check its definition to ensure it is the standard null pointer macro and not a compiler-specific extension.\n\nThese symbols collectively allow the next analyst to inspect the exact declarations/definitions (headers and macros) that the target function depends on and thus determine whether any compiler-specific language extensions are used in the compiled code paths."
