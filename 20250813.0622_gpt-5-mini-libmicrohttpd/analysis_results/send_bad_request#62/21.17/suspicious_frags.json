  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No suspicious fragments found. The only use of a <string.h> function is strlen(BAD_REQUEST_PAGE). BAD_REQUEST_PAGE is defined as adjacent string literals, which the compiler concatenates into a single null-terminated string literal object; therefore strlen will scan within the bounds of that object and cannot access beyond it. There are no other calls to the Standard Library string.h functions listed in Rule 21.17 (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn) that could cause out-of-bounds accesses. The cast to (const void *) and the call to MHD_create_response_from_buffer_static are not string.h operations and are outside the scope of Rule 21.17. Consequently, there are no code fragments in the provided code that need further investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17."
