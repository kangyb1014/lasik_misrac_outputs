  "explanation": "Other code fragments in the provided snippets do not need investigation for Rule 8.13: - The local pointer variables and parameters in send_bad_request (struct MHD_Connection *con, struct MHD_Response *res) are used with APIs that likely modify the pointed-to objects (queueing/destroying responses), so they are expected to be non-const and therefore not candidates for adding const qualification. - Calls to MHD_queue_response and MHD_destroy_response operate on mutable response/connection objects; their parameters should remain non-const. - The use of strlen(BAD_REQUEST_PAGE) is a read-only operation on the string literal; it does not indicate a const-qualification issue beyond the macro itself. The three fragments above were chosen because they relate directly to the const-qualification of pointers: the macro that expands to the string literal, the explicit cast to (const void *), and the pass-through of buffer to the lower-level creation function (which may affect or reveal mismatched const qualifications)."
