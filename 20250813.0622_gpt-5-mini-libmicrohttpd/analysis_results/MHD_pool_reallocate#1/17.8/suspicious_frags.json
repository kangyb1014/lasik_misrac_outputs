  "explanation": "No function parameter variables are assigned to in this function. The pointer parameter 'pool' is used to modify the object it points to (e.g. pool->pos, pool->end), which is allowed by the rule; the pointer variable 'pool' itself is never reassigned. The pointer parameter 'old' is never assigned to; only the memory it points to is read or modified via memset/memcpy/_MHD_* macros (allowed). The scalar parameters 'old_size' and 'new_size' are only read, not written. Pointer arithmetic and casts (e.g. (uint8_t *)old + new_size) produce temporary values and do not modify the parameter variables. Assertions and helper macros (mp_ptr_diff_, mp_ptr_le_, ROUND_TO_ALIGN_*, etc.) are used in a read-only fashion here. Therefore there are no fragments that violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 in this function."
