The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they are required to assess MISRA rule about well\u2011formed for loops:\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash (definition/body): The target calls this function repeatedly; to determine if any for loops affecting program correctness exist in the target\u2019s dynamic behaviour we must inspect this function\u2019s loops (their loop counters, control flags, and whether they use/modify objects shared with the caller).\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest (definition/body): Same rationale as above \u2014 any for loops inside this callee (or their use of external objects) can cause the target\u2019s effective behaviour to violate the MISRA for\u2011loop constraints.\n\n- digest_init_one_time (definition/body): Called by the two digest functions (per the call graph). It may contain initialization loops or modify global state/objects that are used in loops elsewhere; we must inspect its loops and side effects.\n\n- get_base_digest_algo (definition/body): May iterate over algorithm tables or return pointers to shared structures; loops here must be checked for well\u2011formedness and for use/modification of objects visible to other loops.\n\n- digest_get_size (definition/body): Could contain loops or side effects relevant to loop control; include to inspect any internal iteration.\n\n- calc_userhash (definition/body): Lower\u2011level hash computation routine likely to contain loops (over input strings, buffers). We must inspect its for loops to ensure they use a single loop counter, have no forbidden side effects, and do not modify objects used in surrounding loops.\n\n- calc_userdigest (definition/body): Same as calc_userhash \u2014 inspect for loops and any modifications of objects visible to callers.\n\n- user_ids (definition \u2014 array declaration): The target indexes into this global array and increments user_ids_used; if any callee loops reference or modify this array or depend on its size, that affects whether loop control expressions use objects modified in loop bodies.\n\n- user_ids_used (definition \u2014 variable): The target reads and increments this counter; if any for loops (in the target or callees) use this object in their loop clauses or modify it in their bodies, that would violate MISRA constraints. Need its type and where else it is modified.\n\n- struct UserEntry (full definition): The code writes into fields of this struct (buffers for hashes); to inspect loops in callees that write/read these buffers (and to check whether loop clauses use objects that are modified in bodies) we need the exact field names, types and buffer sizes.\n\n- MHD_Result (enum) and values MHD_YES, MHD_NO: The target uses MHD_Result res and compares it to MHD_NO to gate calls; to reason about control flow and whether loop bodies (including called functions) are executed, we need the enum definition and any semantics tied to it.\n\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_* constants: These constants are passed to the digest routines and can select code paths inside those functions; different algorithms may have different implementations and loops \u2014 so their definitions (or the code paths they select) are required to inspect any for loops triggered by those parameters.\n\nIn short: include the full definitions/bodies of all direct callees and their transitive callees (per the static call graph), plus the global variables and type/struct definitions the target reads/writes. Those symbols let the analyzer find any for statements in the called code and determine whether loop counters, control flags, or other objects used in loop clauses are modified in the loop bodies (directly or via called functions), which is the essence of the MISRA requirement."
