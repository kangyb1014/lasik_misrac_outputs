Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "For deciding whether code in add_new_user_entry is dead (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour) the analyzer must know the semantics, sizes, reachability and observable side\u2011effects related to the symbols below:\n\n- user_ids\n  - Required because the function indexes into this array and the capacity expression (sizeof(user_ids)/sizeof(user_ids[0])) is used to decide an early return. To determine if that check (and the subsequent body) can ever execute or is redundant you must know the definition and compile\u2011time size of user_ids.\n\n- user_ids_used\n  - Required to know its initial value(s), how and where it is modified elsewhere and whether the capacity test or the final increment (user_ids_used++) have observable effects. If user_ids_used is never read/used elsewhere, the increment (or the capacity check) could be dead.\n\n- struct UserEntry\n  - The function writes fields of a UserEntry (username, realm, userhash_*, userdigest_*, allow_area_*). You must know the layout and types (and sizes of the hash buffers) to determine whether these stores are observable (overflows, aliased storage) and whether the writes are used by other code (i.e. whether removing those writes changes behaviour).\n\n- enum MHD_Result and constants MHD_YES, MHD_NO\n  - The control flow in the function depends on comparisons with MHD_NO and initial assignment to MHD_YES. To reason about which branches execute and whether subsequent calls are skipped, you must know the possible values and semantics of this enum.\n\n- MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_MD5, MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA256, MHD_DIGEST_AUTH_ALGO3_SHA512_256\n  - These constants are passed to the digest routines; their semantics may affect whether those routines succeed, fail, or have side effects. Knowing their definitions can be necessary when reasoning about whether certain algorithm paths are ever taken or whether calls are no\u2011ops.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash\n  - This function is called multiple times and its return value (compared to MHD_NO) gates later operations. To determine if the calls inside add_new_user_entry (and the code that depends on their result) are dead you need its prototype and semantics: does it mutate global state or the entry buffers even on failure, can it ever return MHD_NO, and under what conditions. If it always returns a success value and always performs side effects that are used elsewhere, those calls are not dead; if it never has side effects and its results are unused, they may be dead.\n\n- MHD_digest_auth_calc_userdigest\n  - Same reasons as for MHD_digest_auth_calc_userhash: its return values and side effects determine whether subsequent code is reachable/observable.\n\n- digest_init_one_time, get_base_digest_algo, digest_get_size, calc_userhash, calc_userdigest\n  - These are the internal callees of the two digest wrappers. If the wrapper results depend deterministically on these helpers (for example always succeed or always fail), that can make branches in add_new_user_entry dead or live. Also these helpers may perform side effects (initialization, global state changes) that make the calls non\u2011removable. To conclude deadness you may need to inspect these lower\u2011level functions.\n\n- add_new_users\n  - Static call graph shows add_new_users calls add_new_user_entry. To decide whether add_new_user_entry is reachable (and thus whether it can be considered dead code) you must examine its callers. If add_new_users is itself never called or its invocation conditions make the call unreachable, add_new_user_entry could be dead. Provide add_new_users implementation to check that.\n\n- main\n  - Because add_new_users is listed as called by main in the static graph, you need to check program entry points to determine global reachability of add_new_users / add_new_user_entry. If main never calls add_new_users (or is excluded), the whole path may be dead.\n\nNote: to fully decide MISRA dead\u2011code membership you also need to know all other code that reads user_ids contents (authentication/lookup routines) and all global initialization sequences that set user_ids_used or any of the digest subsystem state. If those reader/initializer symbols exist outside the set above, include them in the analysis because observable reads make the writes and the increment non\u2011dead."
