  "suspicious_frags": [],
  "explanation": "No code fragments require further investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Rationale:\n\n- Function parameters: username, password, and realm are declared as const char *const; both the pointer and the pointee are const-qualified, satisfying the rule.\n\n- Struct members that are pointers to string data (username, realm) are declared as const char * (pointee const). That meets the requirement that pointers should point to const-qualified types when appropriate. The pointer itself is mutable because entries are assigned different static string pointers at runtime; making the pointer member itself const would prevent those legitimate assignments.\n\n- The local variable entry is declared as struct UserEntry * and points into the modifiable user_ids[] array. The function modifies the pointed object (assigns members such as username, realm, computed digests, and permission flags), so the pointed-to type cannot be const; declaring entry as pointer-to-const would prevent these necessary modifications.\n\n- The static array user_ids and the counter user_ids_used are mutated by the function (fields written and user_ids_used incremented), so their types must remain non-const.\n\n- Calls to the digest functions pass const-qualified string pointers (username, realm, password). There is no evidence in the provided code that these APIs require non-const pointees; the passed arguments are const-qualified and thus consistent with Rule 8.13.\n\nGiven the above, there are no pointer declarations in the provided code that could (and should) be made to point to const-qualified types without breaking required behavior. Therefore no fragments need investigation for compliance with Rule 8.13."
