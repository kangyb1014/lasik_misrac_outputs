Although a string literal has static storage, using the macro in an expression will decay to a pointer to char (non-const), which violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 that pointers should point to const-qualified types when possible. Example violating use: char *p = GREETINGPAGE; \u2014 to fix, declare the literal with const, e.g. static const char GREETINGPAGE[] = \"<html>...%s...</html>\".\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void probe_log(const char *event,\n                      const char *key,\n                      const char *data,\n                      size_t size,\n                      size_t maxanswersize,\n                      const char *note)\n{\n  FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/427.txt\", \"a\");\n  if (!f)\n    return;\n\n  fprintf(f, \"[iterate_post] event=%s key=%s size=%zu maxanswersize=%zu note=%s data_ptr=%p\\n\",\n          event, key ? key : \"(null)\", size, maxanswersize, note ? note : \"(null)\", (const void *)data);\n\n  if (data != NULL && size > 0u)\n  {\n    /* Limit how much of data we dump to avoid enormous logs. */\n    size_t dump = size;\n    if (dump > 256u)\n      dump = 256u;\n\n    fprintf(f, \"data (first %zu bytes): \", dump);\n    /* fwrite accepts void*, cast away const for the write only. */\n    fwrite((const void *)data, 1u, dump, f);\n    if (dump < size)\n      fprintf(f, \"...\");\n    fprintf(f, \"\\n\");\n  }\n\n  fclose(f);\n}\n\nstatic enum MHD_Result\niterate_post (void *coninfo_cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key,\n              const char *filename, const char *content_type,\n              const char *transfer_encoding, const char *data, uint64_t off,\n              size_t size)\n{\n  struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls;\n  (void) kind;               /* Unused.

  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 requires that pointer types be const-qualified where possible. In the iterate_post code all incoming string parameters (key, filename, content_type, transfer_encoding, data) are already declared as const char *. The only mutable pointer in the function is answerstring (char *), which points to a malloc'd, writable buffer and therefore must not be const. The macro GREETINGPAGE (a string literal) has array-of-char type in C, but when passed to snprintf (whose format parameter is const char *) it is implicitly converted to const char * \u2014 no non-const pointer variable is created or assigned in this code. Thus iterate_post itself does not introduce a pointer-to-non-const that could reasonably be made const, and it does not violate Rule 8.13. (Note: code could be tightened by defining GREETINGPAGE as static const char[] for clarity and to avoid any accidental char * = GREETINGPAGE assignments elsewhere, but that is a suggestion, not evidence of a rule violation in this function.)"
