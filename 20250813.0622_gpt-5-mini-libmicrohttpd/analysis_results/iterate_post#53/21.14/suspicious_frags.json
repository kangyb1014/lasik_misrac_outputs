  "explanation": "I inspected the provided function for any use of the Standard Library function memcmp (which Rule 21.14 prohibits for comparing null-terminated strings). The code contains no calls to memcmp. The only string comparison present is strcmp (if (0 == strcmp (key, \"name\"))), which is permitted for null-terminated strings; other standard functions used are malloc and snprintf (no memcmp). Therefore there are no code fragments in this function that violate or require investigation for MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
