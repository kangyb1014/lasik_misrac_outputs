  "explanation": "The claim is not correct. The explicit (void) parameter casts are a conventional way to mark parameters as used and to suppress compiler warnings; they are not considered a MISRA-style defect in this context. MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 targets executed operations that are truly dead in the sense that their removal would not affect the program behaviour. The (void)param statements do not change the program\u2019s functional behaviour at runtime, but their presence is a deliberate, well-understood idiom to affect translation/diagnostics (i.e. to suppress unused-parameter warnings) and to document intent. In practice these casts are treated as an explicit \u201cuse\u201d of the parameter (so static analysis and coding standards commonly accept them) and are the appropriate way to silence warnings without changing the interface. If you want to avoid even the appearance of a Rule 2.2 concern you can (a) remove unused parameters from the function prototype where possible, (b) use a compiler-supported attribute to mark parameters as unused, or (c) document and record an approved deviation where the project policy requires it. But the agent A\u2019s assertion that those (void) casts are a MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 violation is incorrect."
