  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The single statement \u201c(void) off;\u201d is the standard, intentional idiom to mark a parameter as purposely unused and to silence compiler warnings. MISRA Rule 2.2 forbids truly dead code (operations that are executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour). In practice this cast-to-void is not considered accidental dead code \u2014 it documents intent and prevents spurious diagnostics. Moreover, whether removing such a statement would change observable behaviour can be ambiguous in embedded systems (timing, optimization differences, or diagnostics) so it is not safe to classify every (void)parameter; as dead code simply by the literal absence of side effects.\n\nIf the project policy prefers to avoid the idiom, alternatives are to omit the parameter name in the function definition where allowed, use a compiler-specific unused-parameter attribute, or document/justify the use of (void)parameter as a permitted deviation. But the agent A\u2019s assertion that this specific (void) off; is a violation of MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 is incorrect."
