  "explanation": "No unreachable code fragments were found in the provided function. Control-flow analysis shows every statement can be reached: if strcmp(key, \"name\") is true, the inner branch (size > 0 && size <= MAXNAMESIZE) can lead to allocation and either the malloc-failure return or the normal path that calls snprintf and then returns; the else of that inner if (size out of range) sets con_info->answerstring = NULL and then returns. If strcmp(...) is false, the final return MHD_YES is reached. The (void) casts are deliberate to suppress unused-parameter warnings and are not unreachable code. The macro definitions (MAXNAMESIZE, MAXANSWERSIZE, GREETINGPAGE) do not introduce unreachable code. Therefore there are no code fragments that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1."
