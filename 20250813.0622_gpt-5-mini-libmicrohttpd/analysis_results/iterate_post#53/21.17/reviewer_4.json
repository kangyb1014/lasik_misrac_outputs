  "explanation": "The report is correct in the sense required by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. The function calls strcmp(key, \"name\") without checking that the pointer 'key' is valid and that it points to a NUL-terminated array. If the caller were to supply key == NULL (or a buffer that is not NUL-terminated), the strcmp call would dereference/read beyond the bounds of the object referenced by 'key', producing undefined behaviour and therefore violating Rule 21.17. \n\nWhether this is an actual defect in the overall program depends on the calling API contract: if the surrounding library/dispatcher (not shown) guarantees that key is always non-NULL and NUL-terminated, the use is safe; otherwise the code must defend against invalid pointers. MISRA requires that uses of string.h functions must not be able to result in out-of-bounds accesses unless the validity is proven. The provided probe not producing logs does not invalidate the logical issue \u2014 it just means the function was not exercised in the test run.\n\nRecommended remediations: check key != NULL before calling strcmp (and document the precondition), or use a bounded comparison strategy and/or validate the buffer is NUL-terminated within expected bounds, or rely on an explicitly documented/verified API guarantee of non-NULL, NUL-terminated input."
