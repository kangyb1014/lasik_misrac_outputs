  "explanation": "No function parameter variable is modified in the body of iterate_post. The parameters kind, filename, content_type, transfer_encoding and off are explicitly marked unused via (void) casts and therefore not modified. The pointer parameter coninfo_cls is not reassigned; it is read and cast into a local pointer variable (struct connection_info_struct *con_info = coninfo_cls), which does not modify the parameter itself. Only the object pointed to by that pointer (con_info->answerstring) is written to or set to NULL \u2014 modifying the object referred to by a pointer parameter is permitted by MISRA C Rule 17.8. Other parameters (key, data, size) are only read (e.g. strcmp, snprintf) and not assigned to. Therefore there are no fragments that violate Rule 17.8 and nothing else needs investigation for this rule."
