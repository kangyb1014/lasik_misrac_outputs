  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule (parameters themselves must not be modified, though objects they point to may be):\n\n- struct connection_info_struct: needed to determine the layout and mutability of the object pointed to by coninfo_cls and to confirm whether writing to a member (answerstring) modifies the pointed-to object (allowed) rather than the pointer parameter itself (disallowed).\n\n- connection_info_struct::answerstring: the specific member assigned in the function; its type/qualifiers (e.g. char * vs const char *) determine whether the assignment modifies the pointed-to object and whether that is permitted.\n\n- MAXNAMESIZE: used in the size check (size <= MAXNAMESIZE) \u2014 knowing its value/definition ensures the branch decision is correctly understood (does not affect whether a parameter is written, but required to understand control flow that leads to potential modifications).\n\n- MAXANSWERSIZE: used for malloc and snprintf buffer sizing; needed to reason about the allocation and the buffer into which snprintf writes (again to confirm that writing is to a newly allocated buffer, not to a parameter object).\n\n- GREETINGPAGE: the format string passed to snprintf; required to confirm snprintf writes into the allocated answerstring buffer and does not cause any writes into parameter objects (e.g. via side-effects of a macro).\n\n- malloc: prototype/semantics ensure it returns a new block and does not modify any of the function parameters.\n\n- snprintf: prototype/semantics confirm it writes into the provided destination buffer (answerstring) and does not modify the function's pointer parameters like data, key, or coninfo_cls.\n\n- strcmp: prototype/semantics confirm it reads from key and does not modify the key pointer or the pointed-to data.\n\n- enum MHD_Result: the return type used; include to ensure return macros/values (MHD_NO / MHD_YES) are simple constants and not macros with side effects that could modify parameters.\n\n- MHD_NO, MHD_YES: the returned symbols \u2014 include them to ensure they are constants and do not expand to code that could modify parameters.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: include to ensure the 'kind' parameter type/semantics do not imply special behavior (e.g. macros that might mutate the argument) \u2014 mainly to be complete when reasoning about parameter treatment.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine whether any of the function's parameters (the pointer variables coninfo_cls, key, filename, content_type, transfer_encoding, data, or scalar parameters kind, off, size) are directly assigned to or otherwise modified inside iterate_post, or whether only the objects they point to are modified (which is allowed by the rule)."
