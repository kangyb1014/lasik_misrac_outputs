  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report as stated is not correct because it rests on an unproven assumption about the definition of mhd_assert. Whether the assertion statement is dead code depends entirely on how mhd_assert is defined in the project: \n\n- If mhd_assert expands to a real runtime action (for example logging, abort(), or a runtime check in debug builds), then the statement has an observable effect and is not dead code. In that case there is no violation of Rule 2.2. \n\n- If mhd_assert is defined as a no-op (e.g. ((void)0)) in the build being analyzed, then the expression statement becomes an executed no-op; removing it would not change program behaviour and, strictly speaking, that single statement would meet the rule\u2019s definition of dead code. In that situation a Rule 2.2 violation could be reported. \n\nAgent A did not show the actual mhd_assert macro definition from the project, nor demonstrate that it is a no-op in the analyzed build. The test harness inserted logging around the function but produced no evidence that the macro expands to ((void)0) for the build under test, so the claim is not proven. To resolve this definitively, inspect the actual mhd_assert macro for the build configuration in question. If it is a no-op and you want to satisfy MISRA, either remove the noop statement, ensure the macro yields a meaningful effect, or document/justify the use as an accepted exception."
