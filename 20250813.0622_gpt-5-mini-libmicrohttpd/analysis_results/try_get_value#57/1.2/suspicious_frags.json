  "explanation": "I found no uses of compiler-specific or nonstandard language extensions in the provided function. The code only uses standard C constructs and library functions (strlen, strstr, strchr, malloc, memcpy) and standard operators (pointer arithmetic, indexing, casts). There are no occurrences of known compiler extensions such as __attribute__, __builtin_*, typeof, asm, statement-expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, labels-as-values, zero-length/ flexible array misuse, nonstandard calling conventions, or compiler pragmas. The cast to size_t and pointer arithmetic are standard C, and all declarations follow standard syntax. Therefore there are no fragments that need investigation for Rule 1.2 (use of language extensions)."
