Any operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to decide whether try_get_value contains dead code:\n\n- process_multipart_headers\n  - Caller of try_get_value (per the static call graph). To determine whether code in try_get_value is ever executed (or is effectively dead) we must know how process_multipart_headers invokes it and what arguments it passes \u2014 in particular the runtime state of the destination pointer (is *destination always non-NULL, making the early return always taken?).\n\n- post_process_multipart\n  - Caller of process_multipart_headers. To establish the full calling context (initialization patterns, call sites, or orchestration that might make try_get_value unreachable or its body semantically dead) we need the higher-level caller(s) so we can trace how destination and buf/key are produced and whether try_get_value is meaningfully used.\n\n- strlen\n  - Used to compute klen. Its result affects index arithmetic and subsequent checks; understanding its semantics is necessary to reason about whether the following checks/branches can be reached or are vacuously dead (for example, if key is always empty or always present/absent as arranged by callers).\n\n- strstr\n  - Controls the while loop and search progress (bpos and spos). The loop\u2019s execution, the conditions inside it, and whether the function ever reaches the allocation/copy path depend on strstr behavior and return values for the inputs provided by callers.\n\n- strchr\n  - Used to find the closing quote. Whether the function returns early (no end-quote) or proceeds to allocate/copy depends on strchr semantics and the string contents; this affects whether code after that call is ever executed.\n\n- malloc\n  - Allocates memory for *destination. Whether allocation succeeds/fails (and any wrappers/overrides in the project) determines if the assignment/copy that follows is ever performed or becomes dead due to consistent allocation failure or alternative allocation policies.\n\n- memcpy\n  - Performs the copy into the newly allocated buffer. To determine if the copy and the associated write of the terminating NUL are necessary (or dead), we must know the semantics and usage of memcpy in the project (or if it is replaced/optimized away), and whether the copied data is ever used by callers.\n\nNote: These symbols cover the local string/heap operations and the calling context required to decide if code paths inside try_get_value are effectively never used (dead). If deeper analysis of caller logic shows additional helper functions or macros affecting the destination pointer, include those caller-side symbols as well."
