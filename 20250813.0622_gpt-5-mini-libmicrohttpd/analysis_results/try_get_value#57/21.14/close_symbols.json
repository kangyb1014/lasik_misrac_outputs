  "explanation": "Provide these symbols so the next analyser can determine whether try_get_value (directly or indirectly) uses the disallowed memcmp-on-NUL-terminated-strings pattern.\n\n- memcmp: The rule specifically forbids using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The analyser must know the definition/declaration (or any macro/wrapper) for memcmp to detect any direct or indirect use inside this translation unit or via inlined/wrapped implementations.\n\n- memcpy: try_get_value calls memcpy. The analyser should verify memcpy is not a macro alias or wrapper that actually calls memcmp or otherwise performs a forbidden comparison.\n\n- strlen, strstr, strchr: These standard string functions are used in try_get_value. The analyser needs their declarations/implementations (or knowledge of whether they are macros/wrappers) to ensure none of them expand/translate to memcmp-based string comparisons in this build.\n\n- malloc: try_get_value calls malloc; include it to check for any macros/wrapper substitutions that could hide memcmp usage (unlikely but necessary to rule out hidden uses in project-specific replacements).\n\n- NULL: The function uses NULL pointer checks. Include the NULL macro to ensure no surprising redefinition that could hide use of memcmp (defensive: analyzers usually verify standard macros).\n\n- size_t: Used for length computations (klen, vlen). Include to resolve types and check any type-dependent macros that could change behavior.\n\n- MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_: This symbol appears in the static call graph (called by process_multipart_headers). Even though try_get_value does not call it directly, it may exist as a project-provided string-comparison wrapper that could be implemented with memcmp; include it to allow the analyser to check for project wrappers that use memcmp for NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- process_multipart_headers: Caller of try_get_value. Include the caller so the analyser can inspect surrounding code (call sites, macros, inlining) to be certain no memcmp usage is introduced through macros, inlining, or other build-time transformations involving try_get_value.\n\nThese symbols allow the analyser to determine whether any memcmp usage affecting try_get_value is present directly in the function body or indirectly via macros, wrappers, or inlined/called functions."
