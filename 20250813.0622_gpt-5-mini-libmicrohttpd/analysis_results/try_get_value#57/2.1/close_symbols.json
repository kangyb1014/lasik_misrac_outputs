  "explanation": "- process_multipart_headers: caller of try_get_value. You must inspect how the destination (char **) argument is set up and passed (initial value of *destination, number of calls, call sites) to determine whether the initial-NULL check (if (NULL != *destination) return;) or other parts of try_get_value are ever executed or are unreachable in the project context.\n- strlen: used to compute klen. Its semantics (returns length of key) are required to reason about index arithmetic, the comparisons with characters after the key, and whether klen can be zero (affecting subsequent pointer/index calculations).\n- strstr: drives the while loop (finding occurrences of key). Its semantics (returns NULL if not found, pointer to first occurrence otherwise) are required to determine whether the loop body and its various return/continue branches are reachable.\n- strchr: used to find the closing '\"' and compute endv. Its semantics determine whether the not-found branch (NULL == endv) and the vlen computation (endv - spos - klen - 1) can occur and whether vlen can be zero\u2014affecting reachability of allocation/copy code.\n- malloc: allocation of *destination; its semantics (including behavior on size 0) are needed to decide whether the out-of-memory return path is reachable and whether allocation result affects the rest of the code.\n- memcpy: the copy into *destination; required to reason about the code that performs the copy (number of bytes copied) and whether that block can be reached given computed vlen.\n- NULL: used in multiple comparisons in the function. Definition/usage is required to reason correctly about the conditional branches and reachability.\n- size_t: used for klen and vlen and pointer-difference results; required to reason about arithmetic, underflow/overflow, and whether computed sizes allow the subsequent code to execute.\n\nThese symbols together are the minimal set needed to determine whether any of the branches or return statements inside try_get_value are statically or contextually unreachable in the project (MISRA rule analysis)."
