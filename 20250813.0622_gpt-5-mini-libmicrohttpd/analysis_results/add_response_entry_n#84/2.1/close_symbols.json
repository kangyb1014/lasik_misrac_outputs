  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for assessing unreachable code in add_response_entry_n:\n\n- add_response_entry (definition/implementation): add_response_entry is the only static caller of add_response_entry_n per the call graph. To determine whether any branches in add_response_entry_n are unreachable in the overall project, we must inspect how add_response_entry calls add_response_entry_n (what arguments it passes, any pre-checks it performs). If the caller always supplies values that make certain if-conditions in add_response_entry_n always true or always false, those branches may be unreachable. The caller implementation is therefore required.\n\n- MHD_add_response_header and MHD_add_response_footer (definitions/implementations): These are callers of add_response_entry (transitively callers of add_response_entry_n). They may enforce higher-level invariants or preconditions (for example, always providing non-NULL response, non-zero lengths, or sanitized header/content) so they can make branches in add_response_entry_n unreachable. Their code is needed to reason about project-wide reachability.\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_ (declaration/definition/macro): This is the callee whose return value is returned by add_response_entry_n. Although it does not affect whether earlier if-branches are reachable, it may be a macro or function with attributes (e.g., noreturn) or side effects that change control flow in unusual builds. Its declaration/definition is needed to verify it is a normal returning function and to see if any build-time macros could alter the function body (for example, if this identifier is a macro that expands to something that changes control flow).\n\n- struct MHD_Response (type definition): Understanding whether response can be NULL or whether callers pass a valid pointer (or whether functions wrap/guarantee response non-NULL) can make the initial NULL check redundant/unreachable. The type definition can also reveal any annotations or macro magic tied to the type affecting usage.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind (type definition): While not likely to affect reachability directly, the enum definition (and any invariants about which enum values are used) could influence caller behavior and thus whether certain code paths are reachable; include it for completeness when examining callers.\n\n- memchr (declaration/implementation from <string.h> / any project override): add_response_entry_n uses memchr on header and content. If the project provides a custom memchr macro/wrapper or a different semantics (or if static analysis assumptions about memchr are required), that could affect whether calling memchr with certain arguments is UB or whether the checks are meaningful. In particular, to reason about whether memchr(header, ..., header_len) is safe or whether some branches are unreachable because header/content cannot contain those characters (due to prior sanitization), you need to inspect any project-provided implementation/wrapper or visible prototype.\n\nCollecting these symbols (the implementations/prototypes of the callers and of the callee, plus the type definitions and memchr) lets the next analyst determine whether any of the if-branches in add_response_entry_n are never taken or are dead because of guarantees established elsewhere in the project (thus violating the MISRA rule against unreachable code)."
