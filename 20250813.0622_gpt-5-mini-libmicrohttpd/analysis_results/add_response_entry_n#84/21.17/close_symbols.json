  "explanation": "To determine whether add_response_entry_n can cause out-of-bounds accesses via the string.h usage (memchr), the analyzer needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- memchr: The call sites in add_response_entry_n use memchr(header, ..., header_len) and memchr(content, ..., content_len). You must have memchr's exact semantics/prototype (number of bytes read is header_len/content_len starting from the pointer) to reason about required object bounds and guarantee no access past the referenced objects.\n\n- MHD_add_response_entry_no_check_: This function is called at the end of add_response_entry_n. To understand whether header/content pointers or lengths are adjusted, validated, or assumed elsewhere (and thus whether earlier memchr checks are sufficient), the implementation/signature is required. Also to ensure that downstream uses do not rely on different invariants that affect safety reasoning.\n\n- add_response_entry: This direct caller of add_response_entry_n supplies the header/content pointers and lengths. To prove memchr cannot read out-of-bounds you must trace where header_len/content_len and the header/content pointers originate; the caller's code shows how these arguments are derived and whether their sizes match the real object sizes.\n\n- MHD_add_response_header and MHD_add_response_footer: These higher-level callers invoke add_response_entry (per the static call graph). To fully trace provenance of header/content buffers and lengths back to public API boundaries (where buffers are provided by callers of the library), the implementations/signatures of these functions are needed. They may perform conversions, length computations, or checks that affect safety.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The response pointer is validated (NULL check). Knowing the layout/ownership semantics of struct MHD_Response can be necessary if header/content pointers are stored/referenced inside that structure or if its API enforces constraints on buffer lifetimes/sizes.\n\n- enum MHD_ValueKind: Its definition is needed to fully understand how add_response_entry_n is used (different kinds might select different handling code paths in callers), which can affect how header/content arguments are constructed and thus whether memchr arguments are safe.\n\nIn short: memchr plus the functions and types that produce or consume the header/content pointers and lengths are required so you can trace the provenance and ensure the pointer+length pairs represent valid accessible object ranges (no reads beyond object bounds)."
