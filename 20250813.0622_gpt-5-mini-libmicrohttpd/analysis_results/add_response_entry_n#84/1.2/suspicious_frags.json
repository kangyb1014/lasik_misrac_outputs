  "explanation": "No compiler-specific language extensions are present in the provided function. I inspected the code for common extension tokens and constructs that compilers document as extensions (and so would trigger Rule 1.2):\n\n- No use of compiler-specific keywords or attributes such as __attribute__, __declspec, __asm, asm, __builtin_*, __typeof__, __extension__, or similar vendor-specific identifiers.\n- No use of GCC/Clang statement-expressions ({ ... }) used as an expression, or nested functions (a GCC extension).\n- No use of trailing commas in parameter lists, zero-length arrays, or flexible array members in a nonstandard way.\n- No use of C++-only constructs or other non-C language extensions.\n\nAll visible constructs are standard C: a static function definition, an enum type parameter, pointer parameters, size_t, NULL, and calls to the standard C library function memchr. The use of bool is a standard C type when stdbool.h is used (or it could be a typedef in project headers); in either case, its usage here is not an obvious compiler extension token. Therefore there are no fragments in this function that need further investigation for Rule 1.2."
