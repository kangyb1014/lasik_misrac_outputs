Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "I selected fragments that are actual no-op or annotated-as-dead-code constructs which are executed (or may be compiled in) but appear to have no runtime effect and therefore merit investigation for MISRA C Rule 2.2 (dead code): the explicit (void) casts used solely to mute compiler warnings, the mhd_assert that may compile to a no-op in non-debug builds, and the blocks/comments in pre_send_setopt that are marked as \"Dead code currently\" and contain immediate return statements. These are the highest-risk locations for code that is executed yet removable without changing program behaviour.\n\nOther code in MHD_send_data_ and the helper functions was not flagged because it represents normal conditional logic, error handling, or platform-specific code guarded by preprocessor macros. Those branches either: (a) depend on runtime conditions (e.g. socket state, errno, tls_conn) so they are not dead, or (b) are excluded entirely by #ifdef preprocessing and thus not part of the compiled program (not relevant to runtime dead code). The many detailed branches that perform socket option tweaks and perform returns are meaningful for behaviour (they change state or return error indicators) and therefore are not considered dead code for the purpose of Rule 2.2."
