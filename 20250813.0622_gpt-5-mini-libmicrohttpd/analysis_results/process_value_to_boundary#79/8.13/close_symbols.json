  "explanation": "For MISRA C const-pointer analysis we need the concrete declarations and types to determine whether pointers could/should be const and whether passes across APIs are const-correct: \n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor (full definition): the function obtains buf via (char *)&pp[1], writes to buf (buf[newline] = '\\0') and reads many pp members. The exact member types (buffer layout, whether a flexible array of char follows the struct) and which members are pointers (and their constness) are essential to decide whether buf or any pp->* pointers could be const-qualified.\n\n- type/signature of pp->ikvi (function-pointer): pp->ikvi is called with buf as an argument. Knowing the parameter types (whether the buffer argument is declared const) is necessary to decide if the passed pointer could/should be const.\n\n- type of pp->cls: ikvi receives pp->cls; its type may affect constness requirements in the ikvi prototype.\n\n- declarations (types/constness) of content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding: these are passed to ikvi; their declared constness in the struct affects whether the struct fields should be const-qualified.\n\n- declaration of the buffer member after the struct (e.g. char buffer[] or similar): to know whether the memory addressed by &pp[1] is (a) intended writable storage (char[]) or (b) could be const data; this determines whether buf should be const char * or char *.\n\n- types of buffer_pos, buffer_size, value_offset: although likely size_t, we must confirm types to understand pointer arithmetic and boundary checks which affect whether data is modified.\n\n- enum PP_State (definition): needed to know PP_Error and other states' types; while not directly about const pointers, the enum definition is required to fully understand assignments to pp->state and whether any pointer fields are affected by state transitions.\n\n- RN_Dash: value assigned to pp->skip_rn; knowing its type/definition ensures skip_rn's type (possibly enum) and whether any const qualification applies.\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: result values returned by the function and expected by ikvi; their types (enum/int) are needed to match function pointer signatures and check const-correct return types.\n\n- MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: constant passed to ikvi; its type may appear in ikvi prototype and affect constness expectations.\n\n- prototypes of memchr and memcmp: to confirm their parameter types (they accept const void *), which influences whether passing char * (buf) is const-correct or could be changed to const char *.\n\nProviding these symbols allows checking: which pointers are writable vs read-only, whether function pointer prototypes accept const pointers, and whether any non-const pointers in process_value_to_boundary could (or should) be const-qualified to comply with MISRA guidance."
