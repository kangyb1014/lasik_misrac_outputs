  "explanation": "To determine whether the memchr/memcmp usages in process_value_to_boundary can access beyond object bounds we need the following information:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: the full struct definition (layout and sizes). The function uses &pp[1] to set buf, so we must know how the struct is allocated relative to its trailing buffer and what guarantees exist about contiguous memory.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor::buffer_pos and MHD_PostProcessor::buffer_size: these fields are directly used to compute search/read ranges (e.g. newline + 4 < pp->buffer_pos, pp->buffer_pos - newline - 4). We must know their types and invariants (maximum values, relation buffer_pos <= buffer_size) to verify that the size arguments passed to memchr and the indexes used with buf are within the allocated buffer.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor::value_offset and MHD_PostProcessor::must_ikvi: value_offset is advanced by newline and used to call ikvi; must_ikvi affects whether ikvi is called. Knowing their types and semantics ensures correct reasoning about offsets and whether data passed to ikvi might cause indirect out-of-bounds reads.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor::skip_rn and RN_Dash: skip_rn is set to RN_Dash; RN_Dash's definition (type/value) is needed to understand state changes, but primarily to be complete about state mutations (less critical for bounds but useful for control-flow analysis).\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor::state, enum PP_State including PP_Error, and MHD_PostProcessor::dash_state: process_value_to_boundary sets these values and returns when PP_Error is set. Knowing the enum values and effects allows understanding of early exits and conditions that influence buffer consumption and subsequent reads.\n\n- MHD_PostProcessor::ikvi (function pointer) and its prototype: the code calls pp->ikvi(pp->cls, ..., buf, pp->value_offset, newline). We must know the callback signature and whether it expects NUL-terminated strings or trusts the passed length, and whether it might read beyond the supplied length. That affects whether the buf and newline passed are safe and whether earlier writes (buf[newline] = '\\0') are required/sufficient.\n\n- post_process_multipart and find_boundary: process_value_to_boundary is called from post_process_multipart; find_boundary produces the boundary pointer and blen passed into process_value_to_boundary. To verify memcmp(&buf[newline + 4], boundary, blen) we must know how boundary and blen are computed (is boundary a pointer into a valid buffer of at least blen bytes?) and that blen is not larger than the allocated boundary object.\n\n- boundary pointer and blen: specifically, the concrete object and length that boundary/blen refer to (ownership, lifetime, and minimum size) are required to ensure memcmp(boundary, ...) will not read out of boundary's allocation.\n\n- Allocation/initialization routine for MHD_PostProcessor and its trailing buffer (&pp[1]): the expression (char *)&pp[1] assumes a particular allocation/layout pattern (struct followed immediately by a data buffer). We need the code that allocates/initializes pp to verify the actual buffer capacity equals pp->buffer_size and that indexing buf[0 .. buffer_size-1] is valid.\n\n- memchr and memcmp prototypes/semantics from <string.h>: confirm that memchr(ptr, ch, n) examines exactly n bytes starting at ptr and memcmp(a,b,n) compares exactly n bytes; these semantics determine required bounds checks (i.e., that the provided size arguments and pointer arithmetic do not allow reads past allocated objects).\n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO: return values used by the function and the ikvi callback; understanding their meaning helps follow control flow (e.g. early return on MHD_NO) which can affect whether subsequent buffer reads occur.\n\n- MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: constant passed to ikvi; not directly a bounds issue but included so the ikvi invocation can be fully understood in context.\n\nIn short, to evaluate the memchr/memcmp calls for MISRA violations you must know: the memory layout and capacity of the buffer pointed to by buf (how &pp[1] is allocated and pp->buffer_size), the guarantees on pp->buffer_pos, the origin/size of boundary/blen, and the exact semantics of memchr/memcmp and the ikvi callback. The listed symbols provide those necessary hooks to prove (or disprove) that all string.h calls cannot read past object boundaries."
