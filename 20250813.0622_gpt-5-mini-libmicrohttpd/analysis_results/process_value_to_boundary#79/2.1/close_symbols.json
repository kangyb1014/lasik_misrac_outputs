  "explanation": "To decide if any code in process_value_to_boundary is unreachable you must understand every external symbol that affects the function's control flow and exit points:\n\n- struct MHD_PostProcessor: the full definition (members and types) is required because the function indexes beyond the struct (&pp[1]) and reads/writes many members. Without the struct layout you cannot tell if accesses are valid or whether some branches are impossible.\n- MHD_PostProcessor::buffer_pos and ::buffer_size: these two fields drive the newline-search loops and the conditions that break/continue or cause the PP_Error/return path. Their semantics and ranges determine whether the while(1) can loop forever or certain branches (e.g. the 'out of memory' PP_Error return) can be reached.\n- MHD_PostProcessor::skip_rn, ::state, ::dash_state: these are written when a boundary is found. Knowing the possible enum values and how they are used elsewhere is necessary to determine whether those assignments correspond to reachable code and whether later code paths (in this function or callers) become unreachable.\n- MHD_PostProcessor::must_ikvi: controls whether the ikvi callback must be invoked; its initial value influences whether the ikvi call is executed (and therefore whether the error return from that call is possible).\n- MHD_PostProcessor::ikvi (function pointer) and its signature/contract: the callback is invoked and its return value (MHD_NO/MHD_YES or convention) directly controls an early return (PP_Error path). You need the prototype and possible return behaviors (can it block, longjmp, be NULL?) to determine reachability of the code after the call.\n- MHD_PostProcessor::cls, content_name, content_filename, content_type, content_transfer_encoding: these are passed into ikvi; while they do not change control flow in this function, their types/validity may affect whether ikvi can be called (e.g. if ikvi expects non-NULL) and thus whether the ikvi-related return path is reachable.\n- MHD_PostProcessor::value_offset: modified and used to compute offsets; knowing its type and possible overflow behavior is necessary to reason about reachable numeric conditions.\n- RN_Dash: assigned to pp->skip_rn when a boundary is found. Its value/meaning is needed to determine whether that assignment can occur and whether the code that leads to it is reachable.\n- PP_Error: assigned to pp->state in the error branch \u2014 you need the enum definition to see if that is distinct and used by callers; distinguishing PP_Error from other states matters when assessing whether some later code is obsolete/unreachable.\n- MHD_NO and MHD_YES: return values used by this function and by the ikvi callback; you must know their definitions to know what control-flow they represent.\n- MHD_POSTDATA_KIND: argument passed to ikvi \u2014 knowing its definition can affect ikvi behavior and thus reachable outcomes.\n- memory layout for &pp[1] (trailing buffer / flexible array semantics): the code sets buf = (char *)&pp[1] and treats data following the struct as a buffer. You must know how instances are allocated and whether pp->buffer_pos/buffer_size correspond to that buffer; otherwise some branches may be impossible (e.g. buffer_pos never >= something) or UB may make code effectively unreachable.\n- memchr and memcmp: standard semantics are used to find '\r' and compare the candidate boundary; you should confirm expected behavior (return values, no side effects) so you can accurately reason about loop progress and the boundary-detection branches.\n\nHaving these symbols/definitions lets an analyst determine which loop iterations, breaks, continues and return statements are actually reachable under the real data structure layout, the possible values of the pp fields, and the ikvi callback behavior \u2014 which is exactly what's needed to evaluate whether any code in process_value_to_boundary is unreachable (MISRA rule)."
