If oa[i].value (or oa[i].ptr_value) actually holds a pointer to a const-qualified object (e.g. const char * or const struct sockaddr *), the explicit cast to (void *) and the subsequent use as a non-const parameter discards const qualification \u2014 violating MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void log_append(const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n  FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/371.txt\", \"a\");\n  if (f == NULL)\n  {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  va_list ap;\n  va_start(ap, fmt);\n  vfprintf(f, fmt, ap);\n  fputc('\\n', f);\n  va_end(ap);\n\n  fclose(f);\n}\nstatic void probe_before(void *daemon, void *params, int has_first, void *first)\n{\n  /* Log entry with pointers and an indication whether we successfully read a first vararg. */\n  log_append(\"parse_options: enter daemon=%p params=%p has_first=%d first=%p\",\n             daemon, params, has_first, first);\n}\nstatic void probe_after(int ret)\n{\n  log_append(\"parse_options: exit ret=%d\", ret);\n}\n\nstatic enum MHD_Result\nparse_options (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon,\n               struct MHD_InterimParams_ *params,\n               ...)\n{\n  va_list ap;\n  enum MHD_Result ret;\n\n  va_start (ap, params);\n\n  /*\n   * Best-effort probe of the first variadic argument (if any).\n   * We copy the va_list so we do not disturb the original list passed\n   * to parse_options_va; this preserves original logic.\n   * Note: attempting to read a variadic argument when none were passed\n   * is undefined behavior in C.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA C:2023 Rule 8.13 is about declaring pointer types as pointing to const-qualified types where possible. The parse_options function shown does not itself drop a const qualifier: it declares two typed pointer parameters (daemon and params) and a variadic argument list. The scenario described by agent A describes a call-site cast (oa[i].value cast to (void *)) that may discard const qualification \u2014 that would be a problem at the call site (casting away const), not a violation in the parse_options definition as shown.\n\nNotes and recommendations:\n- The problematic const-discarding action (casting a const T * to void *) would be the source of any const-qualification loss; it is not introduced by the parse_options definition. That action, if present, should be fixed at the caller (avoid casting away const) or the called code should be adjusted to accept const-qualified pointers.\n- If the intent is to accept pointer-to-const via the variadic arguments, consider changing the code paths that extract the varargs and parse_options_va to use const void * (and corresponding const-qualified pointer types) and avoid explicit (void *) casts at call sites. This will make const intent explicit and avoid the cast-away-const issue.\n\nTherefore, the specific claim that parse_options violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is not supported by the presented code and scenario."
