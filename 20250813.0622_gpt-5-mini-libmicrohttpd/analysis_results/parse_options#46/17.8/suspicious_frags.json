  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in the provided code. The function only declares local variables (ap, ret), calls va_start(ap, params) which uses params as the last fixed argument but does not modify the parameter itself, passes daemon and params by value to parse_options_va, and returns ret. There are no assignments, increments, or reassignments to the parameters (daemon or params). Modifying the object pointed to by params inside parse_options_va would be allowed by Rule 17.8; the caller here does not alter the pointer parameter itself. Therefore there are no fragments that require investigation under Rule 17.8."
