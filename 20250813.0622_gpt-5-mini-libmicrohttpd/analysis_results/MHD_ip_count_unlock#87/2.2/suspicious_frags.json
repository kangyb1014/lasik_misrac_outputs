  "explanation": "Selected fragments:\n- The call mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master); expands (via the provided macro) to a no-op ((void)0). It is an executed operation that performs nothing; removal would not affect behaviour, so it is a candidate for dead-code investigation.\n- The line (void) daemon; (in the #else branch) is an explicit no-op used to suppress unused-parameter warnings; removing it would not change program behaviour in the configuration where that branch is compiled, so it is a candidate for dead-code investigation.\n- The macro definition #define mhd_assert(ignore) ((void)0) causes all mhd_assert invocations to become no-ops; the macro itself effectively produces dead operations at call sites and thus should be investigated.\nWhy other fragments need not be investigated here:\n- The call MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex); (and its macro expansion) is a side-effecting operation: it attempts to unlock a mutex and may call MHD_PANIC on failure. Removing that call would change program behaviour (synchronization and error handling), so it is not dead code.\n- The preprocessor conditional lines (#if / #else / #endif) are configuration-controlled constructs; code excluded by the preprocessor is unreachable in that build but not necessarily dead code per MISRA (Note 2). We reported the explicit no-op in the #else branch because that statement itself is a no-op when that branch is compiled.\n- The function signature, static qualifier, and other declarations are not in themselves executed no-ops and thus are not candidates for Rule 2.2 investigation from the supplied snippet.\nNo other executable statements are present in the provided function body that look like operations whose removal would not affect program behaviour."
