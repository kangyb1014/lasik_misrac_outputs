  "explanation": "No uses of the <string.h> functions listed by MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 are present in the provided code or in the shown macro definition. Review of the fragments:\n\n- Function MHD_ip_count_unlock: body only calls MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_(&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex) under a thread-enabled conditional, or uses (void) daemon to suppress unused-parameter warnings. There are no calls to memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlen, strspn, or any other string.h routine.\n\n- Macro MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_: expands to an invocation of MHD_mutex_unlock_ and, on failure, MHD_PANIC with a string literal passed through _(). The expansion as shown does not invoke any string.h functions; passing a string literal to a macro or function does not itself cause out-of-bounds access. The string literal \"Failed to unlock mutex.\\n\" is a compile-time constant and not subject to Rule 21.17 concerns.\n\n- There is no other code in the supplied snippets that manipulates buffers or performs pointer arithmetic on character arrays which could cause accesses beyond object bounds.\n\nNote: If the definitions of MHD_mutex_unlock_, MHD_PANIC, or the _() macro (gettext wrapper) \u2014 which are not provided here \u2014 internally call any of the banned string.h functions with pointer parameters, those definitions should be inspected separately. Based solely on the provided code and macro definition, there are no suspicious fragments related to Rule 21.17."
