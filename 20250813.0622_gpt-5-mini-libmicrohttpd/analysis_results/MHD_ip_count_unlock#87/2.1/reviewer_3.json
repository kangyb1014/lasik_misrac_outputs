The #else branch (the '(void) daemon;' statement) is never compiled/used in this build configuration and therefore is unreachable code in the project.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void\nmhd_log_probe (const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n  FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/697.txt\", \"a\");\n  if (NULL == f)\n    return;\n  va_list ap;\n  va_start (ap, fmt);\n  vfprintf (f, fmt, ap);\n  fputc('\\n', f);\n  va_end (ap);\n  fclose (f);\n}\n\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_count_unlock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  /* preserve original assertion */\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);\n\n  /* Log entry and key state info (addresses and master pointer) */\n  mhd_log_probe(\"MHD_ip_count_unlock: enter; daemon=%p, master=%p, per_ip_connection_mutex=%p\",\n                 (void *) daemon,\n                 (void *) daemon->master,\n                 (void *) &daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  /* This branch is expected to be taken in threaded builds. */\n  mhd_log_probe(\"MHD_ip_count_unlock: compiled with thread support; unlocking mutex %p\",\n                 (void *) &daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n  mhd_log_probe(\"MHD_ip_count_unlock: mutex unlocked for daemon=%p\", (void *) daemon);\n#else\n  /* This branch is not compiled in threaded builds; its absence from logs\n     serves as evidence of unreachable (not compiled) code when thread\n     macros are defined. */\n  mhd_log_probe(\"MHD_ip_count_unlock: compiled WITHOUT thread support; (void)daemon executed; daemon=%p\",\n                 (void *) daemon);\n  (void) daemon;\n#endif\n}\n\n```\nThe test code was compiled successfully, but the test log is empty for MHD_ip_count_unlock.

  "explanation": "The agent A is mistaken. MISRA C Rule 2.1 concerns code that is present in the compiled program but cannot be reached by any control flow at run time (i.e. compiled/unconditional code that cannot execute). Code excluded by the preprocessor (#if / #else) is not part of the translation unit when the thread macro is defined \u2014 it is not compiled, not part of the object code, and therefore is not \u2018\u2018unreachable\u2019\u2019 in the sense intended by the rule. The (void)daemon; branch is an alternative for non-threaded builds and may be compiled in other configurations; its absence from a particular build does not constitute unreachable compiled code. The empty test log only shows the function may not have been executed in that run; it does not demonstrate a Rule 2.1 violation. Therefore the report is not correct."
