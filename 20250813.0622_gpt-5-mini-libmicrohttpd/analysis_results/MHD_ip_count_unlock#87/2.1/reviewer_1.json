  "user_message": "An agent A claimed that the following MHD_ip_count_unlock code violates the MISRA C 2023 rule 2.1.\n<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 is A project shall not contain unreachable code.\n.\n</misra_rule>\n<target_code>\nHere is the original code of MHD_ip_count_unlock.\n```c\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_count_unlock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (&daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n#else\n  (void) daemon;\n#endif\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<scenario>\nThe agent A provided the following violation scenario:In the given project MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS is defined (MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS 1). That means the #if branch is always taken and the #else branch with the single statement '(void) daemon;' is never compiled or executed. Because that alternative branch can never be reached in this project configuration, it constitutes unreachable code and therefore violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1.\n</scenario>\n<test_code>\nAlso, the agent A provided the following modified code that prints out the log to support their scenario:\n```c\nstatic void\nmhd_log_probe (const char *msg, const struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  FILE *f = fopen(\"/tmp/logs/697.txt\", \"a\");\n  if (f != NULL)\n  {\n    time_t t = time(NULL);\n    pid_t pid = getpid();\n\n    if (daemon != NULL)\n    {\n      /* Print pointer values for daemon and some members to capture state. */\n      (void) fprintf(f, \"%ld pid=%ld: %s: daemon=%p master=%p per_ip_connection_mutex=%p\\n\",\n                     (long) t, (long) pid, msg,\n                     (const void *) daemon,\n                     (const void *) daemon->master,\n                     (const void *) &daemon->per_ip_connection_mutex);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      (void) fprintf(f, \"%ld pid=%ld: %s: daemon=NULL\\n\",\n                     (long) t, (long) pid, msg);\n    }\n    (void) fclose(f);\n  }\n}\n\nstatic void\nMHD_ip_count_unlock (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)\n{\n  mhd_assert (NULL == daemon->master);\n#if defined(MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS) || defined(MHD_USE_W32_THREADS)\n  /* Log entry into the compiled thread-enabled branch.

  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The #else branch is excluded by the preprocessor when MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS (or MHD_USE_W32_THREADS) is defined, so that alternative is not compiled into the built project \u2014 it does not produce code in the translation unit and therefore is not \"unreachable code\" in the sense intended by MISRA C Rule 2.1. MISRA Rule 2.1 concerns code that is present in the compiled project but cannot be executed at runtime; code excluded by #if/#else preprocessing is not part of the compiled program and so does not violate the rule for that build configuration.\n\nThe empty test log does not prove a Rule 2.1 violation: it may simply mean the function was not exercised by the test harness. If you have a different project policy that treats uncompiled alternative branches in source as a Rule 2.1 violation across all possible build configurations, then that is a project-specific interpretation \u2014 but under the common interpretation and the usual application of MISRA 2.1 to the built project configuration, agent A's claim is incorrect."
