  "explanation": "No occurrences of the Standard Library function memcmp (or any string comparison using memcmp) exist in the provided function MHD_ip_count_unlock or in the related macro definitions shown. The function body either calls MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ (when threading is enabled) or explicitly discards the daemon parameter; the mhd_assert macro is a no-op ((void)0). The MHD_mutex_unlock_chk_ macro expands to a conditional call to MHD_mutex_unlock_ and MHD_PANIC with a string literal; neither expansion uses memcmp or performs comparisons of null-terminated strings. Therefore there are no fragments in the supplied code that need investigation for Rule 21.14. If memcmp is used elsewhere in the codebase (not provided here), those locations would need to be inspected, but none are present in the submitted fragments."
