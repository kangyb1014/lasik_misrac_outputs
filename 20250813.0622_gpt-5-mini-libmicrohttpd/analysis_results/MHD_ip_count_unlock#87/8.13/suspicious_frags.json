  "explanation": "I only reported fragments that involve pointer types or pointer usage that may need const qualification for Rule 8.13. Other parts of the provided code were not included because they do not introduce pointer targets that could be const-qualified or are unrelated to pointer constness: the #if/#else conditional directives control compilation but do not change pointer types; the (void) daemon; line in the else branch is just to suppress an unused-parameter warning and does not affect const qualification; the function return type (static void) and the surrounding braces are not relevant; the MHD_PANIC call and string literal in the macro are not pointer targets that could/should be const-qualified for this rule. The listed fragments cover the function parameter, member accesses, the macro that forwards the mutex pointer, and the underlying unlock call \u2014 these are the code locations that require inspection with respect to whether pointers could/should be const-qualified."
