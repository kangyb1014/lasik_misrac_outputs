  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in the shown fragment. The macro parameter pmutex is untyped (a macro argument) and is simply forwarded to MHD_mutex_unlock_. Unlocking a mutex modifies the mutex object, so the pointed-to type should not be const. A concrete violation scenario would be if a function (or macro) took a pointer to a non-const type but did not modify the pointed object \u2014 e.g. a prototype like void foo(struct X *p) that does not modify *p: p should be declared const struct X *p, otherwise Rule 8.13 would be violated."
