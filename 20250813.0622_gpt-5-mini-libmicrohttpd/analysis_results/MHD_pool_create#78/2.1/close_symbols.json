  "explanation": "For deciding whether any code in MHD_pool_create is statically or effectively unreachable the analyzer must know: \n\n- MAP_ANONYMOUS, _WIN32: these preprocessor macros select which compile-time branches are present. Whether the mmap/VirtualAlloc block exists (and the alternate MAP_FAILED assignment path is compiled) depends directly on them. Without these you cannot determine if whole blocks are compiled out (i.e. unreachable).\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: this value participates in the runtime branch (max < MHD_sys_page_size_ * 4 / 3). Its value or range is required to determine whether the inner \"if ((max <= 32*1024) || (...))\" branch can ever be true or false and thus whether subsequent branches are reachable.\n\n- mmap, VirtualAlloc: the semantics and return values of these functions are necessary to reason about whether pool->memory can ever equal MAP_FAILED after their calls (which controls which allocation path is taken). For example, mmap returns MAP_FAILED on error; VirtualAlloc returns NULL on failure \u2014 that influences reachability of the error/fallback branch.\n\n- MAP_FAILED: the actual sentinel compared against pool->memory; needed to reason whether the comparison can be true for the configured platform/API (and therefore whether the fallback malloc path is reachable).\n\n- malloc, free: malloc is used twice (allocating the pool and the fallback buffer). Behavior (including possible NULL returns and behavior for size==0) is required to see whether early returns or the fallback path are possible or impossible.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: produces alloc_size when mmap fails. Its definition/value determines whether alloc_size can be zero (which affects the later assert mhd_assert(0 < alloc_size)) and therefore whether the code after that assert is reachable.\n\n- struct MemoryPool: the layout and types of fields (memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size) are needed to understand semantics of assignments and comparisons (e.g. type of memory compared to MAP_FAILED) and whether certain operations are no-ops or impossible.\n\n- mhd_assert: the assert macro may expand to code (or to nothing) which can affect reachability (it can contain traps, calls that do not return, or be compiled out). Knowing its definition is necessary to decide if the asserts introduce unreachable subsequent code.\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: used in the final alignment assertion; knowing its value/range is useful to determine whether that assert can ever fail or be a no-op, which affects reachability of code after it (or whether the assert itself is unreachable).\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: macro/function called at the end; its definition could include non-returning behavior or other side effects that influence reachability analysis.\n\nThese symbols (preprocessor macros, function return semantics, constants, and type/layout information) are the minimal set required to determine which branches are actually present in the compiled code and whether any branches/statements can never be executed (i.e. unreachable) in any valid configuration or runtime behavior."
