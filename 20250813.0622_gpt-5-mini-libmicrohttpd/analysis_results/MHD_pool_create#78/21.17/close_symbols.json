  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for checking MISRA string.h bounds violations:\n\n- struct MemoryPool\n  - Definition (member types: memory, is_mmap, pos, end, size) is required to know the type of pool->memory and the semantics/units of pool->size, and to confirm that the values passed to any string.h function (via _MHD_POISON_MEMORY or otherwise) correspond to the allocated object and its size.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY\n  - This macro/function is the only apparent indirect call-site in the function that likely uses string.h routines (e.g. memset). You must inspect its implementation to see whether it calls memset/memcpy/etc and what pointer/length arguments it uses, to determine if those calls can access beyond the allocated object.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN\n  - Used to compute alloc_size in the malloc fallback path. Its definition is needed to verify that the computed alloc_size >= requested max and matches the size passed later to _MHD_POISON_MEMORY (so any memset length does not exceed the allocated buffer).\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE\n  - Used in the alignment assertion and likely used by ROUND_TO_ALIGN; its value is needed to check both alignment assumptions and that any rounding does not shrink the usable buffer below the poisoned length.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_\n  - Used to compute alloc_size for the mmap/VirtualAlloc path (round-up to page granularity). Knowing its value/semantics is necessary to confirm that the mmap/VirtualAlloc allocation size equals the size later passed to the poisoning routine.\n\n- MAP_FAILED\n  - Controls the branch that chooses between mmap/VirtualAlloc and malloc fallback. You must know its definition/value to reason about which allocation branch executes and therefore which size/path applies to the poisoning call.\n\n- mmap and VirtualAlloc (and their relevant flags)\n  - The mmap/VirtualAlloc call sites determine whether a region of alloc_size bytes is reserved/committed and what pointer is returned. Their semantics ensure the returned pointer is valid for accesses of length alloc_size; inspect these to confirm the memory region size matches pool->size used by _MHD_POISON_MEMORY. Include relevant flags (MAP_ANONYMOUS, MAP_PRIVATE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE) if platform-dependent behavior affects the allocated region size or failure modes.\n\n- malloc and free\n  - The fallback path uses malloc(alloc_size). You must rely on malloc's contract (and ensure no wrapper changes) that it provides at least alloc_size bytes; free is present because the function frees pool on failure\u2014understanding allocation/failure semantics is necessary to confirm pointer/size relationships before any string.h call.\n\nIn short: the key indirect string.h usage likely originates in _MHD_POISON_MEMORY, and to show there is no out-of-bounds access you must confirm (1) what _MHD_POISON_MEMORY does (memset/memcpy and lengths), (2) that pool->memory points to a buffer at least pool->size bytes long, and (3) that pool->size (alloc_size) is computed correctly for both the mmap/VirtualAlloc and malloc branches. The listed symbols are the minimal set needed to verify those three points."
