  "explanation": "Needed symbols and why they matter for the MISRA 'pointer should point to const whenever possible' check:\n\n- struct MemoryPool: The decisive information is the declared type of the pool->memory member (e.g. void *, unsigned char *, const void *, etc.). Whether pool->memory is or can/should be const depends entirely on this struct definition and on the types of the other fields (is_mmap, pos, end, size) used in the function.\n\n- _MHD_POISON_MEMORY: This macro/function is called with pool->memory and pool->size. If it writes to the memory (i.e. its prototype takes a non-const void * or otherwise mutates the buffer), pool->memory must be a pointer to non-const data. If it only reads or accepts const void *, pool->memory could be const. Its definition/prototype is therefore essential.\n\n- MAP_FAILED: This macro/constant is compared with and assigned to pool->memory. Its type (typically void * but needs confirmation in this codebase) affects whether assigning it to pool->memory requires casts or violates const-qualification rules.\n\n- MHD_sys_page_size_: The page-size symbol determines which allocation path is taken (mmap/VirtualAlloc vs malloc). While not directly about pointer constness, the allocation method can imply required mutability (mmap/VirtualAlloc return writable memory in this code), so its declaration/type and usage affect whether the memory is intended to be writable.\n\n- ROUND_TO_ALIGN: This macro/function computes alloc_size for the fallback malloc path; its definition may include casts or type adjustments that affect the type passed to malloc and any casts that might relate to pointer constness analysis (e.g. if it embeds casts that would hide qualifier conversions).\n\n- ALIGN_SIZE: Used in the alignment assertion on ((uintptr_t) pool->memory) % ALIGN_SIZE. Its definition/type is needed to confirm the assertion's intent and any implicit casts that could hide qualifier mismatches.\n\nIn short, the critical items are the struct MemoryPool definition and any macros/functions that read/write the memory buffer (_MHD_POISON_MEMORY) or that define the sentinel/returned pointer type (MAP_FAILED). The other listed macros/variables influence allocation path and type/casting behavior that can affect whether pool->memory must be a non-const pointer."
