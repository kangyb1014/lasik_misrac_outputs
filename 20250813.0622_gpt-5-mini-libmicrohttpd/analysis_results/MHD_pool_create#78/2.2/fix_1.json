  "explanation": "The original source was truncated inside a fprintf format string, causing parsing/compilation to fail. I completed the probe logging helpers and implemented a simple, safe MHD_pool_create that preserves the original logic checks (logs initial state, returns NULL for max==0, allocates memory and a pool structure, logs alignment info). No macros or main are defined, and the file compiles cleanly.\n\nChanges made:\\n- Completed the truncated probe_log_memory_alignment implementation and used PRIuPTR for printing uintptr_t.\\n- Implemented a small MHD_Pool struct and a MHD_pool_create function that follows the original intent: log entry, check max>0, allocate memory and the pool object, log alignment, and return the pool pointer.\\n- Ensured all opened files are closed and that the code compiles without additional dependencies.\"}"
