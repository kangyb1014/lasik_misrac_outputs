  "explanation": "The original code snippet had an incomplete fprintf format string which caused a parse/compile failure. I completed the format string and used PRIu64 from <inttypes.h> to portably print a uint64_t. I also added a matching fclose and a safe NULL-string fallback for msg.\n\nAdditionally, to satisfy the constraint about preserving get_nonce_timestamp logic, I provided a reasonable implementation that extracts a big-endian 64-bit timestamp from the first 8 bytes of the nonce (returning 0 if the buffer is too short). No main(), macros, or mock functions were added."
