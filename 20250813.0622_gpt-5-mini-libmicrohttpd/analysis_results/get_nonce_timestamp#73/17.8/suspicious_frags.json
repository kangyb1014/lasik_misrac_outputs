  "explanation": "The only parameter that is modified in this function is the noncelen parameter; both the declaration (size_t noncelen) and the assignment that changes it should be investigated for potential noncompliance with MISRA C Rule 17.8. Other fragments do not need investigation for this rule: the nonce parameter is declared as const char *const (the pointer and the pointed-to data are const) so it is not modified; ptimestamp is declared as uint64_t *const (the pointer itself is const) and only the object it points to may be modified via the helper function MHD_strx_to_uint64_n_, which is permitted by the rule; the remaining conditional checks, return statements, and size comparisons do not modify function parameters and therefore are not relevant to Rule 17.8."
