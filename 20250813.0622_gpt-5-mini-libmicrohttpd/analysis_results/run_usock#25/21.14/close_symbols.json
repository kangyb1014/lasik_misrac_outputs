  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA check of memcmp-on-null-terminated-strings:\n\n- ws_receive_frame: run_usock uses the returned msg pointer from ws_receive_frame. To determine whether msg is a null-terminated C string (and therefore whether any memcmp use on it would violate MISRA), you must inspect ws_receive_frame implementation (allocation, termination, and any internal memcmp usage).\n\n- ws_send_frame: run_usock calls ws_send_frame to send text. ws_send_frame may internally compare buffers/strings using memcmp; its implementation is needed to find any memcmp usage and to see whether it compares null-terminated strings.\n\n- send_all: static call graph shows ws_send_frame calls send_all and run_usock may also interact with it. send_all could contain memcmp calls (or call other routines that do). Include its definition to inspect for memcmp-on-strings.\n\n- make_blocking: included because it appears in the call chain (send_all and run_usock). Although unlikely to compare strings, any reachable function may contain memcmp; include it to rule out memcmp usage in the reachable path.\n\n- MHD_upgrade_action: run_usock calls this; its implementation (and any functions it calls) must be checked because memcmp anywhere reachable from run_usock is relevant to the MISRA violation analysis.\n\n- MHD_upgraded_connection_mark_app_closed_: MHD_upgrade_action calls this according to the call graph. Include it to inspect for any memcmp usage in that downstream routine.\n\n- struct WsData (definition): run_usock accesses ws->urh and ws->sock and passes ws and its fields into other functions. The WsData definition (types of fields and ownership/termination semantics for buffers it may carry) is required to reason whether buffers passed around are null-terminated strings and therefore whether memcmp would be an inappropriate comparison.\n\nNote: The goal is to examine all functions and data reachable from run_usock for any use of memcmp on null-terminated strings. Provide the full source (or prototypes and relevant internal helper functions) for the listed symbols so the next analyzer can locate any memcmp usages and determine whether they compare null-terminated C strings (a MISRA violation)."
