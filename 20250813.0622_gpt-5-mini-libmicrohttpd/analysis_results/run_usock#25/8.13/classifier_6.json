  "scenario": "If ws_receive_frame does not modify the input buffer and returns data that the caller only reads, then both the parameter and the returned pointer should be const-qualified. In the code fragment msg = ws_receive_frame(buf, &got, &type); msg is declared as unsigned char * (non-const) and buf is passed as a non-const array; this permits modification even if none is intended. Thus if ws_receive_frame merely reads buf and returns a read-only pointer, the correct form would be e.g. const unsigned char *ws_receive_frame(const unsigned char *buf, ssize_t *got, int *type); and msg should be const unsigned char *msg; failing to use const in that case violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13. Note: if ws_receive_frame actually returns heap memory that the caller must free or the caller is expected to modify the returned data, then const would not be appropriate and no violation would occur."
