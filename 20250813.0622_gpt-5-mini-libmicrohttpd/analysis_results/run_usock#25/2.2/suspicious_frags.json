  "explanation": "Fragments not reported here were reviewed and are not suspected of constituting dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 for the following reasons: - make_blocking(ws->sock) has a visible side effect (socket mode) and could affect behavior, so it is not dead. - The ws_receive_frame call and its NULL check determine control flow (break on NULL); those operations are executed and affect subsequent behavior. - The free(msg) inside the text-frame branch is used to release the frame buffer before checking sent; removing it would change behavior (memory management), so it is not dead. - The sent variable is assigned on all paths where it is later inspected; assignments that affect control flow (break on -1) are not dead. - The final free(ws) and MHD_upgrade_action(urh, MHD_UPGRADE_ACTION_CLOSE) clearly affect program state and are therefore not dead. - The use of snprintf for sizing and the subsequent call chain may be inefficient but are not provably dead without runtime/semantic information; they perform observable memory allocation/IO actions. The listed suspicious fragments were selected because they contain operations that either appear redundant, are guarded by conditions that may always evaluate the same way, or omit handling for other message types (possible code paths where operations may never be executed). These warrants further investigation to confirm whether any of those operations are in fact dead code."
