  "explanation": "For each listed symbol, why it is required to decide whether code in update_directory is dead (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour):\n\n- update_cached_response\n  - update_directory calls this to publish the built response (or NULL). Whether removing calls to update_cached_response changes observable program behaviour depends entirely on what this function does (store/destroy global cached response, free resources, etc.). Its semantics determine if creating/setting responses in update_directory has side effects, so it must be inspected.\n\n- list_directory\n  - This routine is called to append directory contents into the response buffer; it may modify rdc.buf/rdc.off or other global state. If list_directory has observable side effects (logging, filesystem writes, global state changes), operations in update_directory that only exist to feed list_directory could be dead or necessary. Its behaviour must be known.\n\n- MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback\n  - update_directory constructs an MHD_Response using this factory. The factory\u2019s ownership semantics (does it take ownership of the buffer, schedule the free callback, produce a reference used elsewhere) determine whether creating the response and passing rdc.buf to it is observable. If it is a no-op wrapper, creating the response might be dead; otherwise it is not.\n\n- MHD_destroy_response\n  - update_cached_response (called by update_directory) calls MHD_destroy_response per the static graph. The destroy semantics (side effects, resource release) influence whether earlier allocations/creations are meaningful or could be removed.\n\n- mark_as_html\n  - Called on the created response to mark Content-Type or similar. If mark_as_html modifies global state or the response in a way that affects behaviour, the call is not dead. Need its implementation to decide.\n\n- MHD_add_response_header\n  - mark_as_html calls this (per static graph), and update_directory conditionally calls it under FORCE_CLOSE. Header additions are externally observable (change HTTP behaviour). Knowing its semantics and whether FORCE_CLOSE is defined is necessary to judge deadness of header-related code.\n\n- languages (global array)\n  - The loop over languages drives most of the function\u2019s work. If the array contents (emptiness, values) make the loops never execute or make particular branches unreachable, large portions of code may be non-executed or effectively dead. The array\u2019s contents and lifetime are required to reason about executed operations.\n\n- categories (global array)\n  - Analogous to languages: category entries drive inner loop iterations and printed headers. Their contents determine whether that loop body (and its side effects) is executed.\n\n- struct Language (type and fields dirname, longname)\n  - update_directory reads language->dirname and longname; dirname is used with stat and to build paths. The semantics of these fields (e.g., can dirname be NULL, point to special values) affect control flow and whether operations are executed, so the type/field semantics are needed.\n\n- INDEX_PAGE_HEADER (macro/string)\n  - Its length is used to initialize the buffer and copied into it. If the header is empty or trivial, some memcpy/snprintf operations might be removable; knowing its value is necessary to assess whether copying it is observable.\n\n- INDEX_PAGE_FOOTER (macro/string)\n  - Same rationale as INDEX_PAGE_HEADER for the footer copy and buffer-space checks.\n\n- ResponseDataContext (struct definition)\n  - update_directory manipulates rdc.buf_len, rdc.buf, rdc.off. To know whether these writes are observable (e.g., used by list_directory, by other threads, or by the response factory), we must know the layout and intended semantics of ResponseDataContext.\n\n- struct MHD_Response (opaque type)\n  - The created response object represents the observable HTTP response. Its structure and lifetime semantics (what operations on it are observable) determine whether creation/marking/updating of the response is meaningful or removable.\n\n- MHD_NO (macro/enum value)\n  - list_directory\u2019s return is compared to MHD_NO; the meaning of MHD_NO (failure vs success) controls whether the error-handling path (free buffer, update_cached_response(NULL), return) is executed and thus whether those cleanup operations are necessary.\n\n- FORCE_CLOSE (preprocessor macro)\n  - The MHD_add_response_header(\"Connection\",\"close\") call is guarded by #ifdef FORCE_CLOSE. Whether that code is compiled (and thus potentially dead) depends on this macro. A dead-code judgment must respect compile-time configuration.\n\n- malloc\n  - Allocation is performed and, depending on later ownership (MHD_create...), may be required. If the allocation has no observable effect (e.g., buffer never used or freed elsewhere), it could be dead \u2014 but you must know allocation semantics and ownership to decide.\n\n- free\n  - The function explicitly frees rdc.buf in several error paths and passes &free as a callback to the response factory. Whether those frees are required (or redundant/duplicative) depends on ownership semantics and whether failure paths are reachable; thus free semantics and use sites must be examined.\n\n- strlen\n  - Used to compute header/footer lengths. If these calls return constant known values, some copying could be trivially removable; still necessary to reason about whether copying is observable.\n\n- memcpy\n  - Copies header/footer into the buffer; the observable effect of these copies depends on whether the buffer is ever used to build an observable response \u2014 requires checking buffer usage and ownership.\n\n- snprintf\n  - Many snprintf calls append formatted HTML. Whether those writes are observable depends on whether the buffer is later used (and whether list_directory or the response creation actually emits them). Must know snprintf success semantics and whether its output is relied upon.\n\n- stat (function) and struct stat\n  - stat() results control whether directories are considered \"empty\" and whether code enters the loops. If stat always fails or succeeds for given inputs, large code regions might never/always execute; also stat reads external filesystem state, which is an observable effect (timing and existence). To decide whether code is dead, you must know effects of stat and the target filesystem expectations.\n\nIn summary, the above symbols determine (a) which branches and loops actually execute (languages, categories, stat), (b) whether operations mutate global or externally visible state (update_cached_response, mark_as_html, MHD_create_..., MHD_add_response_header, MHD_destroy_response, list_directory), and (c) ownership/resource semantics (malloc/free, response type, factory). All are needed to decide whether any executed operations could be removed without changing program behaviour (i.e. are dead)."
