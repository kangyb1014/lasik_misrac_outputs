  "explanation": "I found only two uses of functions from <string.h>: strlen(DENIED) and strlen(PAGE). Both DENIED and PAGE are defined as string literals (possibly concatenated adjacent literals), which are null-terminated objects known at compile time. Calling strlen on these literals does not access beyond their bounds, so they do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17. No other <string.h> functions (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strspn, etc.) are used in the provided code. Therefore there are no code fragments that need further investigation under Rule 21.17."
