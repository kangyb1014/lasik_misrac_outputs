  "explanation": "No function parameter is modified in this code fragment. Details: \n- There are no assignment statements, increments/decrements, or pointer reassignments involving the parameters con, upg_header, or con_header. \n- upg_header and con_header are declared as const char * and are only used in comparisons and passed to strcmp and strstr (both take const char * and do not modify the pointers or the pointed-to objects). \n- con is only cast to void to silence an unused-parameter warning; this does not modify the parameter. \n- The ternary return expression and NULL/strcmp checks are pure reads. \nTherefore, Rule 17.8 (a function parameter should not be modified) is not violated; no fragments require further investigation."
