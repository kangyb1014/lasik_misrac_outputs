  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation in this fragment. The call uses con_header which is declared const char * and strstr takes const char * parameters; the return value is compared to NULL and not stored. A violation would occur if the (non-const) return of strstr were assigned to a non-const pointer, e.g. char *p = strstr(con_header, \"Upgrade\"); which would drop the const qualifier."
