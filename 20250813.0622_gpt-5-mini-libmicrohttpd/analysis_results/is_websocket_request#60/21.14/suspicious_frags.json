  "explanation": "No use of memcmp is present in the provided code. The function uses strcmp to compare upg_header to the string literal WS_UPGRADE_VALUE and strstr to search con_header; both pointers are explicitly checked for NULL before use. WS_UPGRADE_VALUE is a string literal (#define \"websocket\"). Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that violate or need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14 (which specifically prohibits using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings). If memcmp appears elsewhere, it would need review, but it is not present in the given snippets."
