  "explanation": "To decide if any part of is_websocket_request is statically unreachable you must examine how it is called and what values its parameters can take:\n\n- ahc_cb: This is the caller listed in the static call graph. You must inspect ahc_cb to see whether is_websocket_request is ever invoked and, if so, with what arguments (always NULL, always non-NULL, or conditional). If ahc_cb never calls it the whole function would be unreachable.\n\n- MHD_lookup_connection_value and MHD_lookup_connection_value_n: These are the likely producers of the upg_header and con_header arguments (they appear in ahc_cb's callees). Their semantics (can they return NULL? do they always return a pointer to an internal static string? can they return an empty string?) determine whether the upg_header/con_header tests in is_websocket_request can ever evaluate both true or false and thus whether either branch of the conditional is unreachable.\n\n- WS_UPGRADE_VALUE: The function compares upg_header against this value with strcmp. You must know the exact value (and whether it can be NULL or an empty string) to determine if the strcmp comparison can ever succeed; if it is impossible to match, the MHD_YES branch may be unreachable.\n\n- strcmp and strstr: Understanding their (standard) behavior is necessary to reason correctly about the conditional expression. In particular, you must know how they behave on non-NULL inputs and that strcmp returns 0 for equality and strstr returns NULL when the substring is absent. Also you must ensure there are no project-specific wrappers/overrides whose behavior could force a particular result and make a branch unreachable.\n\n(Other symbols such as MHD_YES/MHD_NO or the literal \"Upgrade\" do not affect reachability of the conditional logic itself; the key questions are who calls is_websocket_request and what values the header lookup functions can supply, and the exact WS_UPGRADE_VALUE used in the strcmp.)"
