  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for analyzing MISRA rule (memcmp vs null-terminated strings):\n\n- memcmp: the rule is about use of the Standard Library memcmp. Inspecting memcmp (or any direct references) is required to determine whether memcmp is called in this function or in any callees and whether it is used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- cpuset_create: called by the target function; its implementation could call memcmp internally (or return data that later leads to memcmp use). Must inspect to ensure no memcmp-on-strings occurs in this call chain.\n\n- cpuset_size: called to get buffer size for sched_getaffinity_np; inspect implementation/declaration to ensure it does not use memcmp on strings or return data that causes such use.\n\n- cpuset_isset: used in loops for testing CPU membership; its implementation must be inspected to ensure it does not use memcmp to compare null-terminated strings (even if return is an int, implementation details matter).\n\n- cpuset_destroy: called at end; its implementation must be checked for any memcmp usage on strings.\n\n- sched_getaffinity_np: system/library call used to fill cpuset; its implementation (or wrapper) should be checked for memcmp usage on strings.\n\n- getpid: simple syscall wrapper, included to be thorough \u2014 inspect if any wrapper in this build uses memcmp (unlikely but required for completeness).\n\n- sysconf: called when _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN is used; inspect its implementation/wrapper for memcmp usage.\n\n- _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN: the sysconf parameter macro is needed to correlate which sysconf query is made; helps find the relevant sysconf handling implementation to inspect for memcmp usage.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_sys_cpu_count_sysctl_: this local helper is called when NetBSD reports zero CPUs; its implementation must be inspected because it is in the call chain and could use memcmp on null-terminated strings.\n\n- cpuset_t: the type of the cpuset object returned/used here \u2014 its internal representation (struct/array) must be known to determine if any operations treat it as character/string data or if helper functions might use memcmp on embedded strings.\n\n- cpuid_t: CPU identifier type used as loop index \u2014 included to understand any casts/operations that might involve string comparisons in helper functions.\n\nOverall rationale: the target function itself does not contain obvious string operations, but to conclude no MISRA violation we must inspect all directly called functions, relevant macros, and types for any use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings. The above symbols identify the minimal set of functions, types and macro values that form the call/data surface the target function depends on."
