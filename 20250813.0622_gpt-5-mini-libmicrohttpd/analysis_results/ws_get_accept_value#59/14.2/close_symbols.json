The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "You must inspect any function reachable from ws_get_accept_value that may contain for\u2011loops (the MISRA rule applies to every for statement and a loop body includes the behaviour of any called functions). Reason for each symbol:\n\n- SHA1Reset: direct callee; its implementation may contain for loops or side effects relevant to MISRA loop formation.\n- SHA1Input: direct callee; it itself calls SHA1ProcessMessageBlock and may contain for loops whose counters/side effects must be checked.\n- SHA1ProcessMessageBlock: callee of SHA1Input; SHA1 algorithms commonly implement loops here (byte/word processing). We need its source to verify loop counters, side effects and use of external objects.\n- SHA1Result: direct callee; its implementation may contain for loops and it calls SHA1PadMessage, so both must be inspected.\n- SHA1PadMessage: callee of SHA1Result; padding routines frequently contain loops (e.g. for appending length/padding bytes). Inspect for loop well\u2011formedness and whether loop counters or other objects are modified outside allowed places.\n- BASE64Encode: direct callee; encoding routines normally contain loops. We must verify any for loops meet the three MISRA clauses and do not modify objects outside the loop counter (or call functions that do so).\n- struct SHA1Context: type passed to SHA1* functions; inspect fields to see what objects the SHA1 functions modify inside their loops (loop counters must not be modified outside allowed locations and loops must not depend on objects modified in the loop body other than the counter/flags).\n- SHA1HashSize: size constant passed into BASE64Encode and used in loop bounds; loop bounds/constants can affect whether the loop clauses obey MISRA requirements and whether non\u2011counter objects are used in conditions.\n- SHA1_RESULT_SUCCESS: return value tested after SHA1Result; while not directly a loop symbol, the control flow (success/failure) can affect whether particular loops are executed; include to understand conditional execution paths.\n- WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID_LEN, WS_GUID, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN: these constants/objects determine buffer lengths passed to strncpy and SHA1Input and thus feed into loop bounds or indexing inside callee functions (e.g. SHA1Input/BASE64Encode). If callee loops use these values (or objects derived from them) in their clauses, you must check their use against MISRA requirements.\n\n(Excluded standard library internals such as malloc/strncpy/strlen because their sources are typically external; focus on project/source functions reachable from ws_get_accept_value and the constants/types they use.)"
