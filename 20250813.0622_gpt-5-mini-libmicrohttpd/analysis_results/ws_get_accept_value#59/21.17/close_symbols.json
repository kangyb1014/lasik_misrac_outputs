  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is needed for checking the <string.h> bounds rule:\n\n- WS_KEY_LEN: The function compares strlen(key) to WS_KEY_LEN and uses WS_KEY_LEN when allocating and indexing str and when copying from key (strncpy with WS_KEY_LEN + 1). You need the numeric value to verify that the number of bytes copied/read does not exceed source or destination bounds and that adding +1 for NUL is correct.\n\n- WS_GUID: The actual GUID string appended to key is needed to know its contents only insofar as ensuring its declared length matches WS_GUID_LEN and that copying it with strncpy is appropriate (e.g. no embedded NULs that change effective copied bytes).\n\n- WS_GUID_LEN: The function uses WS_GUID_LEN in the malloc size, in the second strncpy call (WS_GUID_LEN + 1) and in computing key+GUID length. Its numeric value is required to check that the destination buffer size (malloc) is sufficient for the bytes copied and the NUL terminator and that the strncpy calls do not write past the allocation.\n\n- WS_KEY_GUID_LEN: This length is passed to SHA1Input as the number of bytes to hash. You must confirm its relation to WS_KEY_LEN and WS_GUID_LEN (typically WS_KEY_LEN + WS_GUID_LEN) to ensure SHA1Input does not read beyond the allocated str buffer. If WS_KEY_GUID_LEN differs, the SHA1Input call could be a source of out-of-bounds access.\n\n- SHA1HashSize: Size of the SHA1 output buffer (hash[]). While not directly a string.h function, BASE64Encode takes that buffer/size; you need this to reason about BASE64Encode input length and subsequent output buffer size, which affects the safety of writing (*val)[len] = '\\0'.\n\n- BASE64Encode (prototype & allocation/NUL-termination contract): Critical. The code relies on BASE64Encode to allocate or provide (*val) and to return len such that writing (*val)[len] = '\\0' is safe. You must know: does BASE64Encode allocate *val? Does it return the number of data bytes excluding a terminator? Does it NUL-terminate the buffer itself or require the caller to append NUL? If BASE64Encode allocates only len bytes or does not guarantee space for a trailing NUL, writing at index len is out-of-bounds.\n\n- strncpy (ISO C semantics): The MISRA rule is about the use of string.h routines. You must assume/confirm the standard strncpy behavior: it copies up to n bytes, does not guarantee NUL-termination if source length >= n, and pads with NULs if source is shorter. This behavior is needed to reason about whether strncpy(str, key, WS_KEY_LEN + 1) yields a terminated string and whether strncpy(str + WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID, WS_GUID_LEN + 1) writes within bounds.\n\n- strlen (ISO C semantics): The initial check uses strlen(key). To conclude that copying WS_KEY_LEN + 1 bytes from key is safe you must rely on the standard definition of strlen returning the number of characters before the terminating NUL; this establishes that key contains WS_KEY_LEN characters plus a terminating NUL so copying WS_KEY_LEN+1 bytes from key is safe. Include the standard semantics (reads until NUL) to reason about possible out-of-bounds reads if key is not NUL-terminated.\n\n- SHA1Input (prototype & read-length semantics): SHA1Input(&ctx, (const unsigned char *) str, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN) reads WS_KEY_GUID_LEN bytes from str. You need its contract to ensure it reads exactly that many bytes (not more) and does not require a terminating NUL. Combined with WS_KEY_GUID_LEN and the allocated size of str this determines whether SHA1Input can read out-of-bounds.\n\n- malloc (allocation semantics): The code computes malloc(WS_KEY_LEN + WS_GUID_LEN + 1). To verify that the requested size is sufficient and that no integer overflow or allocator-specific constraints make the returned buffer smaller, you need to know or assume standard malloc semantics (allocates at least the requested number of bytes or returns NULL). This supports validating that subsequent strncpy and SHA1Input operations do not access beyond the allocated object.\n\nIn short: to check whether any strncpy/strlen/related operations may access beyond their source or destination buffers you must know the numeric sizes (WS_KEY_LEN, WS_GUID_LEN, WS_KEY_GUID_LEN, SHA1HashSize), the actual GUID content (WS_GUID) to confirm its length, the exact semantics/contracts of the nonstandard helper BASE64Encode and SHA1Input (allocation, returned length, whether they NUL-terminate or read exact byte counts), and the standard behaviors of strncpy/strlen and malloc."
