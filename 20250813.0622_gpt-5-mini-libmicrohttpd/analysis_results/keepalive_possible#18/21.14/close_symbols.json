  "explanation": "To determine whether keepalive_possible violates the MISRA rule forbidding use of memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect the code paths that could perform string comparisons. The symbols below are required and why:\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci: The target function calls this lookup function to test header tokens (\"close\" and \"Keep-Alive\"). The lookup implementation may perform token comparisons; we must inspect its source to see whether it uses memcmp on null-terminated header strings.\n\n- MHD_lookup_header_token_ci: The static call graph and codebase sometimes expose two similarly named lookup variants (the call graph shows MHD_lookup_header_token_ci). Include this symbol in case the s_token wrapper delegates to it; you must inspect it as well for any memcmp usage.\n\n- memcmp: This is the Standard Library function targeted by the MISRA rule. Include the symbol so the analyzer can detect direct usage of memcmp in the lookup functions (or any helper they call) and then determine whether it is being used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- struct MHD_Connection: The target function accesses several fields of this struct (keepalive, rq, rp, read_closed, discard_request, stop_with_error). You need the struct definition to understand types and lifetimes, and to know whether any pointers into request/headers are to NUL-terminated strings or to length-delimited buffers.\n\n- struct MHD_Response: The function inspects response fields (flags, flags_auto, upgrade_handler). The response structure definition may include storage/ownership information for header strings; you need that to decide whether memcmp (if used) is comparing NUL-terminated strings.\n\n- definition of c->rq / request structure (type and http_ver field): The code tests c->rq.http_ver and passes the connection to header lookup. You must know the request structure and how headers are stored within it (e.g., pointers+lengths vs NUL-terminated C strings) to determine whether any memcmp usages would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n- header storage & access types/APIs used by MHD_lookup_header*_token_ci (header value representation): The lookup function will operate on the internal representation of headers. To decide if memcmp is being misused you must know whether the header values passed to memcmp are guaranteed to be length-known buffers (which can be compared with memcmp) or are NUL-terminated strings (for which memcmp would violate the MISRA rule). Include the header container/type definitions and any small helper functions used to read header tokens.\n\nIn short: inspect the lookup function(s) and any helper string-comparison functions they call (including memcmp) plus the connection/request/response data definitions that determine whether header values are null-terminated. Those symbols are the minimal set needed to decide MISRA compliance for the target function."
