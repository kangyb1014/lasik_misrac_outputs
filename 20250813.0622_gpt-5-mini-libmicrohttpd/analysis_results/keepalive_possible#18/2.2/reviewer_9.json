  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.2 defines dead code as an operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour. If mhd_assert is defined as ((void)0), the assertion statements are removed by the preprocessor/expansion and are not executed in the compiled program. Code that is absent from the executable is therefore not \"executed\" and does not meet the rule's definition of dead code. \n\n(If mhd_assert were defined so that the assertion expression is evaluated at runtime but has no observable effect, that could be a different issue \u2014 then those evaluations might constitute dead code \u2014 but the scenario described (mhd_assert -> ((void)0)) does not show a Rule 2.2 violation.)"
