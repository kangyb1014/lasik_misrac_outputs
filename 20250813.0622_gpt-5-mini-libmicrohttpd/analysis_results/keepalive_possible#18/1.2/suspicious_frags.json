  "explanation": "I found no use of compiler-specific language extensions in the provided code fragment. The following constructs are standard C and therefore do not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 1.2:\n\n- Enum return type and use of enum constants (e.g. enum MHD_ConnKeepAlive, MHD_CONN_MUST_CLOSE).\n- Pointer and const pointer declarations (e.g. struct MHD_Connection *const c).\n- Preprocessor conditionals and macros (e.g. #ifdef UPGRADE_SUPPORT, MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci) \u2014 these are standard preprocessor features; use of macros is not a compiler language extension per se.\n- Standard control flow statements and operators (if, return, logical and bitwise operators).\n- Comments including the Doxygen-style /**< comment \u2014 this is a standard C comment token and not a compiler extension.\n- Assertions implemented as a macro (mhd_assert) \u2014 macro usage is not a language extension unless the macro itself expands to compiler-specific constructs (none shown here).\n\nNo evidence of known compiler extensions was observed (for example: __attribute__, __asm__/asm, typeof, statement expressions ({ ... }), nested functions, __builtin_* calls, or other vendor-specific keywords). If any of the referenced macros or types (e.g. MHD_IS_HTTP_VER_SUPPORTED, MHD_lookup_header_s_token_ci, the enum/type definitions) expand or are defined using compiler-specific extensions elsewhere in the codebase, those definitions would need to be inspected \u2014 but within this fragment itself there are no explicit language extensions to report."
