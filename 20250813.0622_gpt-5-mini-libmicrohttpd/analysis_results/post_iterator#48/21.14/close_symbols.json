  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for MISRA Rule analysis:\n\n- strcmp\n  - The function uses strcmp to compare 'key'. MISRA's rule forbids using memcmp to compare NUL-terminated strings; to be sure this code does not violate the rule we must confirm strcmp is the actual call and not a macro or wrapper that resolves to memcmp. Provide the strcmp declaration/macros to detect any redirection.\n\n- memcmp\n  - The rule targets memcmp specifically. We need memcmp's symbol to detect any direct or indirect usage (e.g. macro aliases, wrapper functions) in the translation unit or linked headers that could amount to comparing NUL-terminated strings with memcmp.\n\n- memcpy\n  - The function uses memcpy to copy incoming form-data into session->value_1/value_2. To determine whether later comparisons would be of NUL-terminated strings (and therefore whether memcmp would be inappropriate), we must confirm how data is copied and terminated. Knowing memcpy is used helps assess whether the stored buffers are guaranteed to be NUL-terminated before any potential comparisons.\n\n- struct Session (definition)\n  - The code manipulates session->value_1, session->value_2 and session->sid. To decide whether these are NUL-terminated strings (and thus whether comparing them with memcmp would violate MISRA), we need the Session struct definition (types and sizes of value_1/value_2/sid). Also required to verify that the code writes a terminating '\\0' correctly and that buffer sizes are as assumed.\n\n- struct Request (definition)\n  - The function casts cls to struct Request* and reads request->session. The Request definition confirms that 'session' is the expected pointer type and helps trace types/aliases to Session so that buffer semantics from Session apply.\n\n- post_iterator callback prototype / libmicrohttpd header declaration (signature of the iterator callback)\n  - The 'key' parameter is compared with strcmp; to validate that 'key' is a proper NUL-terminated C string (so strcmp is the correct API), we need the callback contract from libmicrohttpd headers: whether 'key' is guaranteed to be a NUL-terminated C string. If 'key' were not NUL-terminated, use of strcmp would itself be unsafe.\n\n- MHD_Result enum and MHD_YES value\n  - Not directly about memcmp, but including the MHD_Result enum / MHD_YES definitions ensures correct resolution of return values/types when analyzing the function; this can be necessary for full static-analysis context and for detecting any macros that might alter behavior or symbol resolution.\n\nProviding these symbols (declarations/definitions) lets the next agent determine: (1) whether any memcmp is present or implicitly invoked (e.g. via a macro or wrapper), (2) whether strcmp is a plain strcmp implementation or an alias to memcmp, and (3) whether the buffers involved (key, session->value_1/value_2/sid) are NUL-terminated strings so that application of the MISRA rule is required."
