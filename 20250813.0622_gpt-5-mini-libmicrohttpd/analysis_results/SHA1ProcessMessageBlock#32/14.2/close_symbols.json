The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "1) SHA1CircularShift\n   - The function (or macro) is called repeatedly from inside the for-loop bodies. MISRA's requirement treats the behaviour of the loop body as including called functions; you must inspect SHA1CircularShift to ensure it has no persistent side effects (does not modify the loop counter 'i' or any object used in the for-loop clauses) and that it does not access or modify objects used in the loop control expressions. If SHA1CircularShift is a macro, check for multiple evaluation of arguments that could introduce side effects.\n\n2) struct SHA1Context (complete definition)\n   - The function reads and updates members of context (message_block, intermediate_hash, message_block_index). You must see the types and qualifiers of these members (e.g. whether message_block is an array of uint8_t/volatile, whether intermediate_hash is an array, whether message_block_index is volatile or has special semantics). MISRA forbids the second clause to use objects modified in the loop body and forbids side effects on objects used in clauses; the full struct definition lets you verify that no loop clause depends on fields that are modified in the body and whether accesses could have hidden side effects.\n\n3) stdint typedefs (uint32_t, uint8_t or equivalent)\n   - Knowing the underlying typedefs ensures correct understanding of types used for loop counter interactions and expressions (e.g. integer promotions, signedness). Also needed if any macro or function uses type-dependent behaviour that could affect whether loop clauses use objects modified by the body.\n\nNotes: No other external symbols (callers SHA1PadMessage / SHA1Input) are required to decide whether the for loops in SHA1ProcessMessageBlock are well-formed under MISRA C \u2014 the primary concerns are whether the loop counter 'i' is the only counter and whether called code (SHA1CircularShift) or accessed context members introduce side effects on objects used in the for clauses."
