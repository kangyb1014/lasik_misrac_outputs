  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "No for-loop fragments in SHA1ProcessMessageBlock appear to violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2. Each for statement meets the clauses of the rule: \n\n- Loop counter: all loops use a single loop counter variable (i) initialized in the first clause (e.g. i = 0 or i = 16). There is only one loop counter per loop and it is not modified in the loop body.\n- Second clause: each loop\u2019s condition (e.g. i < 16, i < 80, i < 20, etc.) uses only the loop counter and does not reference any object that is modified in the loop body. (W, A, B, C, D, E and context->... are modified in bodies but are not used in the loop condition expressions.)\n- Third clause: each loop increment is i++ which modifies only the loop counter and does not use objects modified in the body.\n- Side-effects via called code/macros: the only called macro/function in loop bodies is SHA1CircularShift, which is a pure macro performing bit shifts and has no persistent side effects; thus its use does not introduce hidden modifications to loop-control objects or the loop counter.\n\nTherefore no code fragments need to be reported for further investigation under Rule 14.2."
