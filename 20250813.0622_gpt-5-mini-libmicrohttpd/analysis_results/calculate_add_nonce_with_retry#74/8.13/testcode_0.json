  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\n\n</misra_rule>\n\nAnother agent reported that the target code violated the Rule 8.13.\nHere is the comment from the agent.\n<violation scenario>\nThe parameter 'connection' is declared as 'struct MHD_Connection *const connection' (a const pointer to a mutable object). In this function the pointed-to connection object is only read (no modifications to *connection are performed), so per MISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 it should point to a const-qualified type \u2014 e.g. 'const struct MHD_Connection *const connection'. 'realm' is already 'const char *' (correct). 'da' and 'nonce' are legitimately non-const because they are modified, so the only violation here is the non-const pointee type of 'connection'.\n</violation scenario>\n\nYour job is to insert logging code to capture the control flow and state information of the program.\nInsert logging code so that other agents can reproduce and get evidence for the violation scenario.\n<response format>\n- test_code: a modified calculate_add_nonce_with_retry code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/595.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If test code is not required to validate the scenario, you can leave this blank.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry as much as possible.\nYou CAN just insert probe functions to the original code.\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of calculate_add_nonce_with_retry:\n```c\nstatic bool\ncalculate_add_nonce_with_retry (struct MHD_Connection *const connection,\n                                const char *realm,\n                                struct DigestAlgorithm *da,\n                                char *nonce)\n{\n  const uint64_t timestamp1 = MHD_monotonic_msec_counter ();\n  const size_t realm_len = strlen (realm);\n  mhd_assert (! da->hashing);\n\n#ifdef HAVE_MESSAGES\n  if (0 == MHD_get_master (connection->daemon)->digest_auth_rand_size)\n    MHD_DLOG (connection->daemon,\n              _ (\"Random value was not initialised by \" \\\n                 \"MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_RANDOM or \" \\\n                 \"MHD_OPTION_DIGEST_AUTH_RANDOM_COPY, generated nonces \" \\\n                 \"are predictable.\\n\"));\n#endif\n\n  if (! calculate_add_nonce (connection, timestamp1, realm, realm_len, da,\n                             nonce))\n  {\n    /* Either:\n     * 1.
