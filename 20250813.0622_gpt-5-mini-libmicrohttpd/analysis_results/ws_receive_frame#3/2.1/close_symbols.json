  "explanation": "WS_FIN: required to evaluate the branch conditions (frame[0] == (WS_FIN | ...)). Knowing its numeric value/bitmask is necessary to decide whether the first/second if-conditions can ever be true (and thus whether other branches are unreachable).\nWS_OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME: required to determine the concrete value compared with frame[0] in the text-frame branch; needed to assess mutual exclusivity or impossibility of that branch.\nWS_OPCODE_CON_CLOSE_FRAME: required to determine the concrete value compared with frame[0] in the close-frame branch; needed to assess whether that branch is reachable or redundant.\nrun_usock: the caller of ws_receive_frame \u2014 its implementation constructs and supplies the frame buffer and the *length value. To decide if specific branches are ever reached you must inspect how run_usock populates frame[0], frame[1], and *length (i.e. which opcodes/length encodings it can produce).\nmalloc: the allocation call guards the decryption/loop block with if (NULL != msg). To determine whether that inner block is potentially unreachable (for example because malloc is replaced/wrapped to never fail) you must know the behavior of malloc in the project environment.\nNULL: the macro/value used in the malloc null-check; knowing its definition (and any project-specific redefinition) is needed when reasoning about the if (NULL != msg) branch reachability.\nssize_t: the pointed-to length type affects arithmetic and range of *length (used to compute data_length and loop bounds). Knowing its width/range and any project typedefs is necessary to decide whether computed indices/branches can be reached or if integer conversions make some code unreachable."
