  "explanation": "To decide whether add_response_entry is dead code (its presence or removal would not affect program behaviour) you must reason about two things: (A) whether the function can be reached/used by the program (reachability from callers) and (B) whether the function body performs any effect that matters (including side effects, error conditions or crashes). The listed symbols are necessary for that analysis: \n\n- add_response_entry_n: must inspect its definition/signature and semantics (side effects, return meaning, modification of response) because add_response_entry delegates almost all work to it. If add_response_entry_n has important side effects (or is a no-op) that determines whether add_response_entry is required. Also needed to check whether add_response_entry simply forwards values or performs meaningful conversions. \n\n- MHD_add_response_header and MHD_add_response_footer: these are the direct callers of add_response_entry (per the static call graph). You need their implementations to determine whether add_response_entry is ever invoked at runtime and with what arguments (especially whether header or content can be NULL). If those callers are themselves unused/removed, add_response_entry could be dead. \n\n- MHD_YES and MHD_NO (and enum MHD_Result): the function returns one of these enum values. You must confirm the exact enum semantics and whether callers react to the returned value; removing add_response_entry could change control flow if callers expect those results. Knowing the enum definition also helps detect whether return values are used or ignored. \n\n- struct MHD_Response and enum MHD_ValueKind: the parameter types may imply side effects (e.g. methods manipulating response internals) or constraints on arguments (e.g. Ownership, allowed NULL). Their definitions are needed to determine if removing add_response_entry alters state or whether calls are validated elsewhere making this function redundant. \n\n- strlen: the function calls strlen(header) and strlen(content) without checking header for NULL. You must confirm whether header can be NULL at call sites; otherwise the call could cause undefined behaviour (crash). Understanding the behaviour of strlen in this context is necessary to judge whether add_response_entry performs meaningful validation or is redundant/unsafe.\n\nIn summary, to decide if add_response_entry is dead you must (1) inspect its callee add_response_entry_n for effects, (2) inspect its callers (MHD_add_response_header / MHD_add_response_footer and, if needed, their callers) to establish reachability and argument constraints (NULLness), and (3) verify the types and enum return values to see if removal would change observable behaviour. The symbols above are the minimal set required to perform that reasoning."
