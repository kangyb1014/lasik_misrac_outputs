  "explanation": "- z_stream: The const-correctness issue revolves around assignments to strm->next_in and strm->next_out. You must know the exact declaration of z_stream (types and const qualifications of next_in and next_out, and avail_in/avail_out types) to determine whether assigning src (const void *) to strm->next_in or tmp to strm->next_out discards or requires const qualification (i.e. whether the API forces removal of const).\\n- Bytef: z_stream member pointer types use Bytef (or z_const Bytef). Knowing Bytef's underlying type (typically unsigned char) is required to understand the pointer types involved and how const should be applied.\\n- z_const: zlib historically uses a z_const macro to express optional const. You need the macro definition in the used zlib version to know whether next_in/next_out are declared with const (z_const Bytef *) or not. This directly affects whether the assignment from a const source violates the rule.\\n- deflate prototype/semantics: deflate operates via the z_stream fields; you must know whether deflate ever writes into the input buffer pointed-to-by next_in (it normally reads from next_in and writes to next_out). If deflate writes into the input buffer, src cannot be const; if it only reads, src could be const but z_stream API may not express that. The prototype and documented semantics are therefore needed to decide if const qualification is possible/appropriate.\\n- memcpy prototype: memcpy's parameter types (dest non-const, src const) show that memcpy accepts a const source. This is relevant to whether tmp (used as memcpy source) could/should be const; combined with deflate semantics (does deflate write into tmp?) this tells whether tmp must be non-const.\\nThese symbols together let an analyst determine whether pointers in compress_buf (src, tmp, and the z_stream member pointers) are effectively used read-only and therefore should be declared or propagated as const, or whether API requirements force non-const pointers (which would justify the current non-const declarations)."
