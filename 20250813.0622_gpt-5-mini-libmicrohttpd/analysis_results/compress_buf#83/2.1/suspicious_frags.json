  "explanation": "I focused on constructs that can create unreachable-code situations: the outer do/while loop and its control (the if/else that sets flush and decrements src_size but does not advance the src pointer) and the inner do/while loop together with the early return path on realloc failure. These are the sites where control flow can cause code following the loops to become unreachable (infinite looping, or early return on error). Other parts of the function are simple, directly reachable initializations or single-statement operations (variable declarations, '*dest = NULL;', '*dest_size = 0;', the final 'return ret;') and do not contain branch/loop constructs that would render code unreachable. No other standalone statements in the function are inherently unreachable based on the presented logic, so they do not need further investigation for Rule 2.1."
