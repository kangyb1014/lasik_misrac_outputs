  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they matter for checking the MISRA rule (\"The Standard Library function memcmp shall not be used to compare null terminated strings\"): \n\n- memcmp\n  - Direct: the rule targets use of memcmp. To determine whether compress_buf (or any function it calls) violates the rule you must know whether memcmp is invoked in this translation unit or in any callee reachable from compress_buf. The symbol memcmp is required so the analyzer can detect any direct or indirect use and inspect the call-sites to see whether the compared buffers are null-terminated strings.\n\n- deflate\n  - compress_buf calls deflate. If deflate (or code in its implementation) calls memcmp to compare buffers, that could create an indirect violation. You must inspect deflate\u2019s implementation (and its callees) for any memcmp usage and whether those calls compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- read_cb\n  - read_cb is the caller of compress_buf (per the static call graph). To decide whether any memcmp use (direct or indirect) operates on null-terminated strings you need to see how read_cb constructs/passes the src buffer and tmp buffer and what semantic type (string vs. binary data) they have. If read_cb passes null-terminated string data, then a memcmp inside compress_buf or inside deflate that compares that data could violate the rule.\n\n- z_stream\n  - compress_buf manipulates z_stream fields (avail_in, next_in, avail_out, next_out) and passes the stream to deflate. To understand whether the buffers passed to deflate are treated as string data (and thus whether any memcmp inside deflate would be comparing null-terminated strings) you need the z_stream definition and the semantics of its fields. This helps determine whether data handled here is textual (NUL-terminated) or binary.\n\nNotes: standard library functions used locally in compress_buf (memcpy, realloc, free) do not implement string comparison and so are not the primary concern for this MISRA rule; only memcmp (directly or in reachable callees) and the provenance/semantics of the buffers passed into potential memcmp calls (hence read_cb and z_stream/deflate) are necessary to decide compliance."
