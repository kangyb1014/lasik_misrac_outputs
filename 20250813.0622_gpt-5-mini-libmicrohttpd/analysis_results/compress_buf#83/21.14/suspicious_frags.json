  "explanation": "I inspected the provided functions (compress_buf and read_cb) and found no uses of the Standard Library function memcmp. The code uses memcpy for copying memory, realloc/free for allocation management, and zlib's deflate; there are no comparisons of null-terminated strings using memcmp or any evidence of memcmp being used on strings. Therefore there are no code fragments in the supplied code that need investigation under MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.14."
