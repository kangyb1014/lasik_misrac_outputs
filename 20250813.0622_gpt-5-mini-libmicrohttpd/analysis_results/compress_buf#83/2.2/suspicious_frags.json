  "explanation": "Other code fragments in compress_buf are not reported because they appear to be necessary for correct operation and thus are unlikely candidates for dead code under MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. Examples: the initializations (*dest = NULL; *dest_size = 0;) are required to make realloc()/size arithmetic well-defined; the CHUNK constant and the avail_in/avail_out assignments control chunked compression and loop termination; the flush variable and outer loop ensure the stream is flushed on the final iteration; setting strm->avail_out and strm->next_out (not listed above) and calling deflate() are required to produce output bytes; the inner loop condition and the use of have to compute sizes and offsets are part of the data-copy logic; and the error-handling (tmp_dest == NULL branch, free calls and early return) manage allocation failures. These operations have observable effects (memory allocation/cleanup, compression progress, produced output) and so are not considered dead code without further evidence. The listed fragments were selected because they are places where executed operations may have no effect (e.g. updates that are not subsequently used, zero-length copies, repeated/overwritten assignments) and therefore warrant investigation."
