  "explanation": "The MISRA C Rule 21.17 applies to uses of <string.h> functions. In this function, the only calls to string.h functions occur in the three reported fragments (strcmp, strstr, strlen). All other code lines do not invoke string.h functions (they perform file I/O, stat/close, MHD response creation/queueing, pointer assignments, and macro uses) and therefore are not relevant to Rule 21.17. No other uses of memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strspn (or other <string.h> functions) are present in the submitted function, so no further fragments need investigation under this specific rule."
