  "explanation": "Agent A's report is correct. The expression-statements such as '(void) upload_data;' are no-ops that are executed but have no effect; removing them does not change program behaviour, so they meet the definition of dead code in MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2. They are not unreachable (note 2) and are not initializations (note 3), so the idiom used to silence compiler warnings constitutes dead code per the rule. The test harness attempt to log execution does not change this fact (the log being empty is a test coverage/run issue and does not refute that the cast is a no-op). Recommended remedies are to avoid naming unused parameters in the function signature (if permitted), or to use a standardized mechanism for marking parameters as intentionally unused (compiler attribute or project-wide UNUSED macro) rather than leaving no-op expression-statements in the code."
