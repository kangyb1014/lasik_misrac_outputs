The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "The target function contains no for-loops itself, but calls four helper routines that may contain for-loops or call other functions that do. To judge compliance with the MISRA for-loop rule you must examine the actual loop(s) in those helpers and any functions they call, and any globals/types/macros those loops use. Specifically:\n\n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_: The target calls this; its implementation may contain for-statements or call other functions used inside for-loop bodies. We need the source to inspect loop counters, side-effects, and modifications of objects used by the loop.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_cpuset_getaffinity_: Same reason \u2014 it may implement native cpuset iteration with loops and may use globals or macros that affect loop behaviour.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_sched_getaffinity_np_: Same reason \u2014 non-portable variant may include loops that must be validated against MISRA requirements.\n\n- mhd_tool_get_proc_cpu_count_w32_: Windows-specific helper: may contain loops (or call other code that does) and use globals; its implementation must be checked.\n\n- __linux__ and __GLIBC__: These preprocessor symbols determine which call sequence is compiled. To know which helper implementations (and thus which loops) are relevant you must know the build configuration. Only the compiled/active code paths need to be checked for MISRA violations.\n\n- All non-local functions called (directly or indirectly) by the four helper functions: The MISRA rule states the behaviour of a for-loop body includes called functions. Any function invoked inside a for-loop (or that a helper calls and that contains loops) must be provided so you can inspect whether loop counters are modified or side-effects occur.\n\n- All global/static variables read or written by the four helper functions: The MISRA rule forbids loop conditions or update clauses that use objects modified in the loop body. If the helpers or their callees use globals as loop counters/flags or modify globals inside the loop, those must be known.\n\n- Type and macro definitions used inside those helper functions (e.g., cpu_set_t, CPU_* macros, ssize_t/int types used as loop counters): Loop semantics can depend on the types and macros used for counters and tests (e.g., signedness, atomicity, inline macros expanding to expressions with side effects). Include those typedefs and macro definitions so you can determine whether the three for-clauses and loop body respect the MISRA constraints.\n\nProvide the source (or declarations) for the listed symbols so the next analyst can examine each for-loop, its counters, side effects, and any function calls within the loop body to determine MISRA compliance."
