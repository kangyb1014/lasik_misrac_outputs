  "explanation": "The statement \u201c(void) version;\u201d is an executed expression statement that has no side effects. Removing that statement would not change the program\u2019s observable behaviour, so it meets the rule\u2019s definition of dead code. Under the quoted text of MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 (\u201cAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code\u201d), the explicit void-cast of an unused parameter is therefore a violation.\n\nNote: It is common practice in C to use (void)param; to suppress compiler warnings about unused parameters, but that idiom still constitutes an executed no-op and therefore is classified as dead code by Rule 2.2 as stated. To avoid the violation, either remove the no-op and omit the parameter name in the function definition (or otherwise restructure the code so the parameter is genuinely unused without an executed statement), or apply an appropriate, documented deviation/justification if the project permits that remedy."
