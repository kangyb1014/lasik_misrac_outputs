  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The code shown (answer_to_connection) contains no executed statements that are semantically redundant in the sense intended by MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2, and the alleged offending statement \u201c(void) transfer_encoding;\u201d is not present in the provided answer_to_connection code. Agent A\u2019s scenario refers to iterate_post (which was not shown), so the claim is unsupported by the supplied target code.\n\nEven if iterate_post did contain an expression-statement of the form \u201c(void)transfer_encoding;\u201d, that idiom is the standard way to suppress unused-parameter compiler warnings and to document an intentionally unused parameter. Although removing such a statement would not change program behaviour at runtime, MISRA rule 2.2 is intended to forbid truly useless run-time operations that affect the program\u2019s behavior or timing; toolchains and coding practice treat (void)param as a deliberate annotation rather than accidental dead code. Finally, the provided test modification failed to compile, so no runtime evidence was produced to substantiate the claim.\n\nFor these reasons the reported violation is not demonstrated and the report is incorrect."
