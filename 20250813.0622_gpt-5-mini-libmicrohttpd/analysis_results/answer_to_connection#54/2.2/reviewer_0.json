  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The three expression-statements \u201c(void) cls;\u201d, \u201c(void) url;\u201d and \u201c(void) version;\u201d are the conventional source-level idiom for documenting intentionally unused parameters and for suppressing compiler warnings. Although they have no observable side\u2011effects and a compiler will typically generate no code for them, they are not the kind of executed, redundant operations that MISRA Rule 2.2 is intended to forbid. Rule 2.2 targets code that is executed at runtime but whose removal would not affect program behaviour (including timing) in the deployed system; a cast-to-void used solely to mark an unused parameter does not meaningfully change program behaviour and is intended as documentation/diagnostic control rather than dead, redundant logic. The added test harness that logs activity also did not exercise answer_to_connection (so the empty log is a coverage issue and not evidence of a Rule 2.2 violation). If the project policy prefers to avoid that idiom, other mechanisms (e.g. compiler-specific unused-attribute macros or removing the parameter) can be used, but the agent A\u2019s claim that those (void) casts are a MISRA 2.2 violation is incorrect."
