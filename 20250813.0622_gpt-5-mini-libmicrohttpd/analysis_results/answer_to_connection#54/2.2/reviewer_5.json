  "explanation": "The report is not correct. Agent A misapplies Rule 2.2 in two ways: (1) the alleged offending statement (\u201c(void) off;\u201d) is said to be in iterate_post, but the code under review is answer_to_connection (which contains the common idiom (void) cls; (void) url; (void) version;). The report does not show iterate_post or demonstrate that a no-op there causes a real behavioural issue. (2) Casting an unused parameter to void is the conventional, intentional idiom to document and suppress \"unused parameter\" warnings. Although removing such a cast would not change program functional behaviour, MISRA\u2019s intent when identifying \u201cdead code\u201d is to find executed operations that serve no legitimate purpose. The void-cast idiom serves the legitimate purpose of documenting intent and preventing spurious warnings; it is not the kind of unintended, redundant logic that Rule 2.2 targets. If a project wants to avoid even this idiom for strict stylistic reasons, it should use an accepted alternative (omit the parameter name in a function prototype, use a compiler-specific annotation, or record an approved deviation) rather than treating the idiom as a Rule 2.2 defect."
