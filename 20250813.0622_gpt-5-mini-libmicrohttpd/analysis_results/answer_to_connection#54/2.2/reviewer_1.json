  "explanation": "The report is not correct. The three \u2018\u2018(void) param;\u2019\u2019 statements are the conventional way to indicate intentionally unused parameters and to suppress compiler warnings; they are not the kind of unreachable or truly redundant code MISRA\u2019s dead\u2011code prohibition targets. Whether or not they perform any observable side\u2011effects is context dependent (a cast evaluates the operand, and could matter for volatile objects or timing), so their removal can, in principle, change behaviour. Even if a particular compiler would produce exactly the same object code without them, toolchains and standards bodies treat these idioms as explicit annotations of intent rather than defects to be removed. In short, calling these no\u2011op casts \u201cdead code\u201d under MISRA C:2023 Rule 2.2 is not a correct application of the rule."
