  "explanation": "The report is not supported by the provided code. MISRA C:2023 R8.13 says a pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever it is possible to do so, but you must show that the pointed-to object is never modified. In the snippet shown, con_info->answerstring is only initialized to NULL and later tested and passed to send_page (which takes a const char *). That alone is not evidence that the pointer could or should be const: it may be assigned/modifed elsewhere (for example by the POST post-processor / iterate_post callback, which is the likely place where a mutable string would be built). Passing a char * to a function expecting const char * is allowed and common; conversely, if code were to assign a const char * (a string literal) into a char * field, that would be questionable and would need explicit review for const-correctness (and could raise other MISRA concerns), but no such assignment is shown here.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided code and the likely behavior (POST processing writes/modifies the answerstring), there is insufficient evidence that answerstring should be declared const char *, so the claim of a Rule 8.13 violation is not correct. To be certain, inspect all assignments to con_info->answerstring: if it is never modified through that pointer and only ever points to immutable data, then changing its type to const char * would satisfy R8.13; if it can point to modifiable buffers, keeping it as char * is appropriate."
