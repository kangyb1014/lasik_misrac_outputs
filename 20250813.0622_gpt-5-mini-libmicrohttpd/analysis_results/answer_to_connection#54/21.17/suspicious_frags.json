  "explanation": "Fragments not listed have been reviewed and are not considered suspicious with respect to Rule 21.17 for the following reasons:\n\n- The static page strings (askpage, errorpage) are compile-time constant null-terminated strings; calls such as strlen(askpage) and strlen(errorpage) are safe. The send_page call with those static pages is therefore not an issue.\n\n- MHD_create_post_processor performs multiple validation steps (checks return of MHD_lookup_connection_value_n, confirms boundary presence, checks blen bounds relative to buffer_size and adjusts buffer_size) and allocates buffer_size+1 bytes via MHD_calloc_ with the +1 to ensure a terminating NUL. Those checks and the allocation mitigate common out-of-bounds risks for the boundary processing; only the specific boundary-handling lines are highlighted above as they perform strlen/strstr/indexing on substrings and therefore warrant inspection.\n\n- Calls to library helpers such as MHD_str_equal_caseless_n_ and MHD_lookup_connection_value_n use explicit length arguments or are comparing to static literals; these are designed to avoid overruns and do not themselves use plain string.h functions in a way that risks out-of-bounds accesses (hence they were not included beyond the place where their result leads to handing data to functions that may expect NUL-termination).\n\n- The use of strcmp on method is flagged (see fragments) because method is an external input parameter; it is important to inspect the context to ensure method is non-NULL and NUL-terminated as required by strcmp. Other local comparisons against static literals are safe only when the pointers are known to be valid.\n\n- The MHD_post_process wrapper itself checks for post_data_len == 0 and NULL pp before dispatching; however, the calls that pass post_data and post_data_len into lower-level post processing are flagged because the lower-level routines may use C string functions that expect NUL-termination while the data is provided with an explicit length and may not be NUL-terminated.\n\nI have therefore reported all fragments where string.h functions (strcmp, strlen, strstr, direct indexing into strings) are used on data that can originate from external input or from buffers that may not be NUL-terminated, so they require further investigation to ensure no out-of-bounds access occurs. Other code paths either operate on known static NUL-terminated strings or perform protective checks/allocation and were not included."
