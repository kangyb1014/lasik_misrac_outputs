  "explanation": "- _DEBUG: The first #if branch is compiled only when this macro is defined; knowing its definition determines whether that block (and its setting of newline_needed) is present \u2014 critical to decide reachability of code that depends on newline_needed.\n- __GNUC__: Several #if branches are conditioned on this macro; its presence/absence controls compilation of those warning branches.\n- __OPTIMIZE__: Controls the \"compiled without enabled compiler optimisations\" branch (combined with __GNUC__). Its definition affects whether that block is compiled and thus whether code inside is reachable.\n- __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: Controls the size-optimisation warning branch (with __GNUC__). Required to know if that code is compiled in.\n- MHD_VERSION: The MHD_is_feature_supported call and its enclosing block are conditionally compiled only when MHD_VERSION >= 0x00097701. Knowing the numeric value of this macro determines whether that entire runtime branch can exist.\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: This runtime function is called inside a compiled block; its possible return values and semantics determine whether the if-condition (MHD_NO != MHD_is_feature_supported(...)) can be true at runtime, which affects reachability of the fprintf and the newline_needed assignment.\n- MHD_NO: The value/definition of this constant (or enum) is required to evaluate the runtime comparison and thus whether the conditional block can be entered.\n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: The feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported; needed to understand what feature is being queried and whether the function can reasonably return a value other than MHD_NO for that feature.\n\n(Notes: standard I/O symbols like fprintf/printf and stderr are not required to assess reachability. The above preprocessor macros and MHD symbols determine whether code is compiled in and whether the runtime conditional can be true \u2014 both are required to conclude if any code paths in print_perf_warnings are unreachable.)"
