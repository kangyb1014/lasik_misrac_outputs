  "explanation": "To decide whether print_perf_warnings violates the MISRA rule about use of <string.h> functions we must inspect any functions and compile-time conditionals that affect what code is present and what functions are invoked. Reason for each symbol:\n\n- fprintf: Called directly from print_perf_warnings. Inspect its declaration/usage to confirm no buffer pointers from this function are passed to any <string.h> function and to verify format-string usage is literal (so no out-of-bounds string.h calls originate here).\n\n- printf: Same rationale as fprintf (final newline is printed via printf); ensure no string pointer from this function is passed into string.h functions indirectly.\n\n- stderr: The FILE* passed to fprintf; include to confirm it's a standard stream (not an application buffer) and that no buffer pointers from this function are used with string functions.\n\n- MHD_is_feature_supported: A direct callee; its implementation must be inspected because it could use <string.h> functions internally. Although no buffers are passed from print_perf_warnings to it, a violation could still exist in code reachable from this call if the analysis scope includes callees.\n\n- MHD_NO: Used in the comparison of the return value of MHD_is_feature_supported. Needed to understand the control flow (whether the conditional fprintf is compiled/executed).\n\n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: The feature enum/constant queried by MHD_is_feature_supported; needed to understand the call and any code paths that might trigger string operations.\n\n- MHD_VERSION: Controls whether the MHD-related block is compiled. The value determines whether the call to MHD_is_feature_supported and associated fprintf are present in the compiled code.\n\n- _DEBUG, __GNUC__, __OPTIMIZE__, __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: Preprocessor macros that determine which warning fprintf calls are compiled into print_perf_warnings. They are required to resolve which literal strings and calls are present in the compiled unit (thus whether any string-handling calls exist in the compiled function).\n\n- stdio.h: Header/declarations for fprintf/printf/FILE; include to confirm signatures and that only constant format strings (literals) are passed and no buffer pointers from this function are used with string.h APIs.\n\nIn short: include the two I/O functions and their header/stream symbol to confirm that the function only emits literal strings, the MHD feature check function and its related macros/constants to determine compiled control flow and to allow inspection of that callee for any <string.h> usage."
