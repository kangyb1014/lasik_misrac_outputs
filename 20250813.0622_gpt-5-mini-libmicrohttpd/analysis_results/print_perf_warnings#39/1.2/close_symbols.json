  "explanation": "For determining whether print_perf_warnings uses compiler or vendor language extensions you must know which conditional macros are actually provided and whether any called macros/functions are themselves implemented via extensions: \n\n- __GNUC__: a compiler-predefined macro used in the source to gate code. You must know if this is provided by the compiler/environment (using it can indicate reliance on GCC-specific behavior). \n- __OPTIMIZE__: GCC predefined macro used to detect whether optimizations are enabled; its presence/usage is relevant to whether the code depends on compiler-specific features. \n- __OPTIMIZE_SIZE__: GCC predefined macro (size-optimisation flag); same reason as above. \n- _DEBUG: project/compiler debug macro used to enable debug-only code; needed to decide if debug-only code (possibly relying on extensions) is compiled in. \n- MHD_VERSION: libmicrohttpd version macro controls inclusion of a block that calls MHD_is_feature_supported; you must know its value to know whether that block is present. \n- MHD_is_feature_supported: called from the function; you need its declaration/definition to see whether it is a plain standard C function or a macro/inline/attribute that uses compiler-specific extensions. \n- MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD: the feature identifier passed to MHD_is_feature_supported; its definition may be an enum/macro that could be implemented using extension constructs. \n- MHD_NO: the sentinel/boolean value compared against MHD_is_feature_supported's return; you must know its type/definition to ensure no extension usage. \n- fprintf, printf, stderr: standard I/O symbols used by the function. Confirming their standard declarations (via <stdio.h>) ensures they are not replaced by non-standard/extension macros in the build environment. \n- <microhttpd.h> (libmicrohttpd public macros/decls): header that defines MHD_VERSION, MHD_NO, MHD_FEATURE_DEBUG_BUILD and MHD_is_feature_supported; needed to inspect whether any of those are implemented with language extensions. \n- <stdio.h>: to confirm fprintf/printf/stderr are standard declarations and not replaced by extension-specific variants.\n\nThese symbols let the analyzer determine which conditional branches are actually compiled and whether any referenced macros/functions are implemented using compiler or vendor extensions (the thing MISRA forbids)."
