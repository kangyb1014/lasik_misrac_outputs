  "is_report_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The report is not correct. MISRA Rule 2.1 targets unreachable code in the compiled translation unit (code that can never be executed at runtime). Code that is excluded by the preprocessor (#if/#else) is removed before compilation, so the #else branch (and its (void) daemon;) is not present in the translation unit when MHD_USE_POSIX_THREADS is defined and therefore is not \u201cunreachable code\u201d in the compiled program \u2014 it simply isn\u2019t part of that build. The logging test producing no output does not demonstrate a reachability violation (it only shows the function may not have been invoked by the test). The #else branch is a standard idiom to suppress unused-parameter warnings when built with alternate configurations; it only exists for builds where the threading macros are not defined. Consequently agent A\u2019s claim that this source violates MISRA C 2023 Rule 2.1 is incorrect."
