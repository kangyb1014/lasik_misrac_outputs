  "explanation": "Rule 8.13 concerns pointers that could be declared to point to const. In this function the only pointer token is the parameter 'daemon' and its uses are limited to read-only access (daemon->master), taking the address of a member to pass to the mutex lock helper, and the unused cast. There are no other pointer declarations, pointer arithmetic, casts, or assignments in the provided code fragment that could be affected by const-qualification. Therefore only the parameter declaration and its direct uses need investigation; other parts of the function (braces, preprocessor conditional, static/void keywords, etc.) are not relevant to Rule 8.13."
