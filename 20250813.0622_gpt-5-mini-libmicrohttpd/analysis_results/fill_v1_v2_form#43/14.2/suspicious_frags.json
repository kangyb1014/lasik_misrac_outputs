  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nThe target MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop counter and optionally loop control flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement. \n</misra_rule>\n<instruction>\nOther agents will judge whether the code follows the MISRA C 2023 guidelines.\nThey will investigate the code fragments you give.\nYour job is to find code fragments in the code that should be investigated to check whether the code follows the MISRA C rule.\n</instruction>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- suspicious_frags: The list of suspicious code fragments in the code.\nIt should contain only the code fragments exists in the code.

  "explanation": "MISRA C:2023 Rule 14.2 concerns the well-formedness of for statements. The provided function fill_v1_v2_form contains no for statements (no occurrences of the for keyword, and no for-like constructs in the shown code). Therefore there are no in-function for-loop fragments to investigate for Rule 14.2.\n\nNotes on scope and completeness:\n- The macro FORM_V1_V2 is defined as SECOND_PAGE in the additional code; that expansion is not a for statement and introduces no for-loop in the shown fragment.\n- Several functions are called (add_session_cookie, MHD_create_response_from_buffer_with_free_callback, MHD_add_response_header, MHD_queue_response, MHD_destroy_response). Any for loops inside those functions or inside macros they use are not present in the provided source and hence cannot be reported here; they should be inspected separately if required.\n- No other constructs in this function (initializers, expressions, or casts) hide a for loop.\n\nBecause there are no for loops in the supplied code, no suspicious fragments relevant to Rule 14.2 are reported."
