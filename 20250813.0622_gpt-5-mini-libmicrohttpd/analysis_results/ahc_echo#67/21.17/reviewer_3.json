  "explanation": "Agent A's report is essentially correct. The code calls strcmp(method, \"GET\") and strcmp(method, \"POST\") without checking that 'method' is a valid pointer to a NUL-terminated array. MISRA C 2023 Rule 21.17 requires that uses of <string.h> functions shall not result in accesses beyond the bounds of the objects referenced by their pointer parameters. If, at run-time, 'method' were NULL or not NUL-terminated, the strcmp calls would dereference memory out of bounds (or dereference a NULL pointer), violating Rule 21.17.\n\nWhether the code actually violates the rule in a given system depends on the contract provided by the caller/library (libmicrohttpd): if the API guarantees that 'method' is always non-NULL and NUL-terminated, the calls are safe and compliant. However, the function as written does not check or document that precondition, so from the point of view of a static MISRA check (or absent an assured external contract), the use of strcmp here is potentially unsafe and therefore the report is correct.\n\nRecommendation: either (a) add an explicit check (e.g., if (method == NULL) handle error) before calling strcmp, or (b) document and enforce the external precondition (and ensure the MISRA compliance argument includes that guarantee)."
