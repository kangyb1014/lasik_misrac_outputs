  "explanation": "For deciding whether any operation inside MHD_MD5_update is dead (i.e. executed but removable without changing program behaviour) you need the following symbols and why: \n\n- struct Md5Ctx (definition: fields count, buffer, H and their types/sizes): the function reads/writes ctx->count, writes into ctx->buffer and passes ctx->H to md5_transform. To know whether certain branches/assignments (bytes_have computation, ctx->count += length, final memcpy into buffer) ever affect observable behaviour you must know the exact types, widths, alignment and buffer capacity.\n\n- MD5_BLOCK_SIZE (macro value): the branch and loop conditions (bytes_have, bytes_left, while (MD5_BLOCK_SIZE <= length)) depend on this constant. Whether those branches/loops are ever taken (or can be removed) hinges on this value.\n\n- mhd_assert (macro/function definition and build-time behaviour): the assert is executed at function entry. Its presence/absence (and whether it has side effects like logging/abort) changes behaviour. To decide if its execution is dead you must know its implementation and how it is compiled (e.g. NDEBUG-like options).\n\n- MHD_FAVOR_SMALL_CODE (build macro / configuration): this conditional controls the early-return shortcut for length==0. Whether the early return exists in the build matters for deciding if the length==0 path (and related code) is dead or reachable in the compiled binary.\n\n- md5_transform (implementation): the function is called from several places inside MHD_MD5_update. Whether calls to md5_transform are required (i.e. removing them would change behaviour) requires knowing md5_transform side-effects (state of ctx->H, external effects, timing) and whether callers rely solely on its effects.\n\n- MHD_MD5_init (or any Md5Ctx initializer used in the code base): to tell if operations in update are dead across the MD5 lifecycle you must know how a context is initialised (initial ctx->count, buffer content). Some assignments or branches in update could be dead given init semantics.\n\n- MHD_MD5_finish (implementation): finish may depend on intermediate state left by update (ctx->count, buffer, H). To determine whether any update operations are redundant you must know how finish consumes ctx and whether removing update operations would change final digest behaviour.\n\n- digest_update and its callers (digest_update_str, digest_update_with_colon, calculate_nonce, calc_userdigest, calc_userhash, digest_auth_check_all_inner): static call graph shows MHD_MD5_update is invoked via digest_update. To decide if any branch inside update is dead you must examine all call sites (which argument patterns, lengths and contexts are passed). For example if callers never pass length==0, or always call with lengths that are multiples of MD5_BLOCK_SIZE, certain branches/paths could be unreachable or dead.\n\n- memcpy (implementation or project replacement): update relies on copying data into ctx->buffer; memcpy semantics (and any project override with side effects) are relevant to determine whether those copy operations can be removed without changing behaviour.\n\nThese symbols collectively allow analysis of: caller argument patterns, context lifecycle (init/update/finish), build-time configuration that affects compilation paths, and the side-effects of called routines \u2014 all necessary to conclude whether any executed operations in MHD_MD5_update are removable (dead) under the MISRA rule."
