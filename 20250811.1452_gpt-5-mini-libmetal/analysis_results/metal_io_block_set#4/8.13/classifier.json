  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_io_block_set code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/35.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_io_block_set as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_io_block_set:\n```c\nint metal_io_block_set(struct metal_io_region *io, unsigned long offset,\n\t       unsigned char value, int len)\n{\n\tunsigned char *ptr = metal_io_virt(io, offset);\n\tint retlen = len;\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\treturn -ERANGE;\n\tif ((offset + len) > io->size)\n\t\tlen = io->size - offset;\n\tretlen = len;\n\tif (io->ops.block_set) {\n\t\t(*io->ops.block_set)(\n\t\t\tio, offset, value, memory_order_seq_cst, len);\n\t} else {\n\t\tunsigned int cint = value;\n\t\tunsigned int i;\n\n\t\tfor (i = 1; i < sizeof(int); i++)\n\t\t\tcint |= ((unsigned int)value << (CHAR_BIT * i));\n\n\t\tfor (; len && ((uintptr_t)ptr % sizeof(int)); ptr++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr = (unsigned char) value;\n\t\tfor (; len >= (int)sizeof(int); ptr += sizeof(int),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlen -= sizeof(int))\n\t\t\t*(unsigned int *)ptr = cint;\n\t\tfor (; len != 0; ptr++, len--)\n\t\t\t*(unsigned char *)ptr = (unsigned char) value;\n\t\tatomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);\n\t}\n\treturn retlen;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_io_block_set code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: the pointer 'ptr' is declared as 'unsigned char *' and is used to write to the memory region (lines that assign through '*(unsigned char *)ptr' and '*(unsigned int *)ptr'). Rule 8.13 requires pointers to be const-qualified when they are not used to modify the pointed object and prohibits const-qualified pointers when the function modifies the object. Because this code clearly modifies the object via ptr, it is correct for ptr to be non-const and thus does not violate Rule 8.13. (If metal_io_virt were to return a pointer to const, that would be a violation because the function performs writes; however in the shown code ptr is non-const and used for writes.)",
