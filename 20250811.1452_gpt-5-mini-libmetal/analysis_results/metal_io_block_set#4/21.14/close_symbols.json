  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for checking the MISRA rule about using memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings:\n\n- metal_io_virt: This callee may itself call standard library functions (including memcmp) or other helpers that do string comparisons. We must inspect its implementation to ensure no memcmp-based null\u2011terminated string comparison is reachable from metal_io_block_set.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: The layout (fields such as size and ops) is needed to understand how io is populated and what function pointers or data it carries; this helps identify reachable functions that might use memcmp and to reason about whether any buffers passed are NUL\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- struct metal_io_ops (prototype of block_set): The declaration/type of the ops structure and the exact prototype of block_set are required to (a) know what arguments are forwarded to block_set implementations (so we can tell whether string pointers/terminators could be passed) and (b) find all assignment sites of compatible functions.\n\n- All concrete implementations assigned to io->ops.block_set: metal_io_block_set delegates work to io->ops.block_set when non-NULL. Any violation could be in those implementations. You must inspect every function that can be stored in block_set to see if it calls memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- memcmp: The rule concerns use of the standard memcmp function. You must find all uses of memcmp reachable from metal_io_block_set (directly in this function, in metal_io_virt, or in any block_set implementation) and confirm whether it is used to compare null\u2011terminated strings.\n\n- Any project-specific wrappers/aliases around memcmp/strncmp/strcmp: Projects sometimes wrap or macroize memcmp or provide similarly named helpers. To be sure no forbidden use occurs, include any wrappers or aliases that perform memory/string comparisons (they may hide memcmp calls).\n\nCollecting and inspecting these symbols (the implementations and type definitions listed) is sufficient to determine whether any code reachable from metal_io_block_set uses memcmp to compare null\u2011terminated strings."
