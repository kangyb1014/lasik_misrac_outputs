  "explanation": "Why each symbol is required to decide if the function violates the MISRA rule 'A function parameter should not be modified':\n\n- metal_io_virt (declaration/definition): the call metal_io_virt(io, offset) produces the local pointer 'ptr'. To be sure there are no hidden side effects that could modify the caller's parameters (for example a prototype that takes pointers rather than values or some macro-wrapped implementation), you need the prototype/definition. This confirms that io and offset are passed by value (or by pointer) and whether metal_io_virt can modify any of this function's parameters indirectly.\n\n- struct metal_io_region (full definition, including member 'size' and 'ops'): the code dereferences io->size and io->ops. Knowing the exact type of io and its members is needed to determine whether access to those members could involve macros or accessor functions that might modify the parameter 'io' itself, and to confirm that 'io' is indeed a pointer parameter (so modifications to the object pointed-to are allowed while reassignment of the parameter would violate MISRA).\n\n- type/definition of the 'ops' member and the signature of ops.block_set: the function calls (*io->ops.block_set)(io, offset, value, memory_order_seq_cst, len). You must know the prototype of block_set to confirm it does not expect e.g. pointer-to-len (which could indicate a different call convention) and to ensure no macro expansion or inline wrapper could be reassigning any of this function's parameters. Also confirms that passing len is by value (so callee cannot change this function's parameter variable) and that calling the function does not itself reassign the caller's parameter variables.\n\n- atomic_thread_fence (declaration) and memory_order_seq_cst: although the fence and memory-order macro are unlikely to affect parameter modification, they could be implemented as macros or inline constructs with side effects in some platforms. Inspecting their declarations/definitions rules out any unexpected modifications of parameters (or macro name collisions) during the atomic fence call.\n\n- CHAR_BIT and uintptr_t (definitions / included headers): these macros/types are used in pointer/shift arithmetic and alignment checks. Knowing their definitions ensures that pointer arithmetic or casts do not implicitly alias or refer to the function parameters in an unexpected way (for instance, if some platform-specific typedef or macro changes behavior).\n\nNote: The most direct evidence of a MISRA parameter-modification breach in this function is the assignment to 'len' (len = io->size - offset; and subsequent decrements of len). To fully validate whether that is a breach in the given codebase you still need the above symbols to exclude any unusual macro/prototype expansions or aliasing that could change the interpretation of those tokens."
