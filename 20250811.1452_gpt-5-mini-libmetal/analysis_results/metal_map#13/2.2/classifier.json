  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_map code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/106.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_map as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_map:\n```c\nint metal_map(int fd, off_t offset, size_t size, int expand, int flags,\n\t      void **result)\n{\n\tint prot = PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, error;\n\tvoid *mem;\n\n\tflags |= MAP_SHARED;\n\n\tif (fd < 0) {\n\t\tfd = -1;\n\t\tflags = MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS;\n\t} else if (expand) {\n\t\toff_t reqsize = offset + size;\n\t\tstruct stat stat;\n\n\t\terror = flock(fd, LOCK_EX) < 0 ? -errno : 0;\n\t\tif (!error)\n\t\t\terror = fstat(fd, &stat);\n\t\tif (!error && stat.st_size < reqsize)\n\t\t\terror = ftruncate(fd, reqsize);\n\t\tif (!error)\n\t\t\tflock(fd, LOCK_UN);\n\t\tif (error)\n\t\t\treturn -errno;\n\t}\n\n\tmem = mmap(NULL, size, prot, flags, fd, offset);\n\tif (mem == MAP_FAILED)\n\t\treturn -errno;\n\t*result = mem;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_map code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. Each executed operation can affect program behaviour in at least one execution path. For example, the early statement flags |= MAP_SHARED is relevant for the fd >= 0 path (it governs whether MAP_SHARED is passed to mmap). Although that write is overwritten in the fd < 0 branch, removing it would change behaviour for fd >= 0 runs, so it is not dead. All other statements (the locking/fstat/ftruncate sequence, the mmap call and error checks) are required for correct behaviour and are not operations that can be removed without changing program behaviour.",
