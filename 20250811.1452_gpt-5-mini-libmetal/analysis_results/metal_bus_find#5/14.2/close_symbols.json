Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed for checking the MISRA \u2018\u2018for loop shall be well\u2011formed\u2019\u2019 rule for metal_bus_find:\n\n1) metal_list_for_each (macro definition)\n   - The source for the for loop in metal_bus_find is the metal_list_for_each macro. To determine whether the three clauses of the for statement meet MISRA requirements (what is the loop counter, what appears in the init/test/iterate clauses, and whether there are side effects), you must inspect the macro expansion. The macro may expand to a for(...) with particular init/test/iteration expressions or call other operations; the exact expansion is essential to judge clause contents and side effects.\n\n2) metal_container_of (macro definition)\n   - This macro is used inside the loop body to obtain bus from the list node. Its expansion may evaluate expressions or perform pointer arithmetic; to ensure the loop body does not modify the loop counter or objects used in for clauses (and to confirm it introduces no hidden side effects), the macro definition is required.\n\n3) struct metal_list (type definition)\n   - metal_list_for_each iterates over a metal_list; the type definition shows which fields are accessed/modified by the macro (e.g., next pointer) and whether any of those fields are shared with objects used in the loop clauses. Knowing the structure is necessary to identify what the loop counter actually is (a node pointer, a next pointer, etc.) and whether that object is modified in the loop body.\n\n4) struct metal_bus (type definition, at least fields 'node' and 'name')\n   - The loop body uses metal_container_of(node, struct metal_bus, node) and then accesses bus->name. To check the MISRA conditions that the loop counter is not modified in the body and that the body\u2019s behaviour (including accesses) does not affect objects used in the for clauses, you must know the bus layout and whether accessing bus->name or other fields could alias or modify the loop control object.\n\n5) _metal (global) and its type / definition of _metal.common.bus_list\n   - The iteration root &_metal.common.bus_list appears as the list head in the macro invocation. You must know the concrete type of that member and how the macro uses it (e.g., whether the head is used as sentinel or counter) to determine which object(s) constitute the loop counter and whether any of those objects are touched in the loop body.\n\n6) prototype/definition of strcmp (declaration from <string.h>)\n   - strcmp is called inside the loop body within the if condition. MISRA\u2019s rule notes that the behaviour of any functions called inside the loop body is part of the loop body behaviour. To check for persistent side effects or modification of objects used in the for-clause, you must know that strcmp has no persistent side effects and does not modify the arguments.\n\n(ENOENT and other unrelated constants are not required to assess the form of the for loop.)"
