  "explanation": "Required symbols and why they are needed to decide if metal_virt2phys contains dead code:\n\n- _metal\n  - metal_virt2phys directly reads _metal.pagemap_fd and _metal.page_shift. You must know the definition and possible runtime values of these fields (whether pagemap_fd can be permanently < 0, or page_shift fixed) to determine if branches are ever taken and whether the function's work or returns are effectively no-ops.\n\n- metal_log\n  - The function invokes metal_log on error paths. Logging is a side-effect: removal of the logging calls could change program behaviour (observable output). To judge whether code is dead you must know whether metal_log has side effects the rest of the system depends on.\n\n- METAL_LOG_ERROR\n  - The log level/macro used by metal_log; needed to understand the logging call and whether it is a no-op or produces observable effects in the build/configuration.\n\n- pread\n  - The function calls pread to read /proc/pid/pagemap. You must know whether pread can fail deterministically (making later code unreachable or redundant) and whether it has side-effects that matter. Also analyze the return value handling (error < 0) to see if that branch is meaningful.\n\n- strerror and errno\n  - Used when pread fails to produce an error message; errno is read to create return -errno. Determine whether errno can be set/observed and whether removing that error path would change behaviour.\n\n- EINVAL and ENOENT\n  - The function returns these standard error codes in some branches. You must know the semantics/usage of these codes in callers (do callers check these values?) to decide if those branches are necessary.\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map\n  - This is the only direct caller (per the call graph). To decide if metal_virt2phys is dead you must inspect how metal_shmem_try_map uses the return value and the *phys output (whether it ignores them, conditionally uses them, or whether other side effects matter). If the caller ignores the function or its outputs, the call could be dead.\n\n- metal_shmem_open\n  - Caller of metal_shmem_try_map (call-chain). Useful to determine whether the call-chain is reachable in actual program flows/configuration; helps establish whether metal_virt2phys is ever executed.\n\n- metal_map, metal_unmap, metal_io_init\n  - These are other functions invoked by metal_shmem_try_map. Their behavior (especially whether they depend on the physical address returned by metal_virt2phys, or whether they cause observable side-effects that change control flow) may determine whether the result of metal_virt2phys is actually used. Including them helps determine if removing metal_virt2phys changes program behaviour because callers would behave differently (e.g., skip mapping/unmapping, change initialization).\n\nNote: Kernel pagemap semantics (what bits in entry mean) and runtime environment (presence/absence of /proc/pid/pagemap access) are also relevant conceptually, but they are not symbols in the code base; you may need external documentation or runtime assumptions in addition to the listed symbols."
