  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required to check for unreachable code:\n\n- _metal (struct definition and global instance): metal_virt2phys reads _metal.pagemap_fd and _metal.page_shift. To decide if the initial if (_metal.pagemap_fd < 0) and the final computation using _metal.page_shift can ever be reached/are always taken, you must see how _metal is declared and what values its fields can hold (initial defaults, visibility, and whether they can be negative).\n\n- metal_shmem_try_map: this function is the direct caller (shown in the call graph). Its implementation shows the calling context for metal_virt2phys (how it calls it, what addr values are passed) and may contain additional logic that guarantees or prevents certain branches inside metal_virt2phys from being executed (e.g., preconditions that make a test always true/false).\n\n- metal_shmem_open: listed as the caller of metal_shmem_try_map in the call graph; this routine is likely responsible for opening pagemap and initializing _metal.pagemap_fd. To determine whether the check for pagemap_fd < 0 can ever be true at runtime (and thus whether the corresponding branch is reachable), you must inspect the initialization and error-handling performed here.\n\n- metal_io_init: metal_shmem_try_map calls metal_io_init (per the call graph). metal_io_init is likely where _metal.page_shift is initialized. If page_shift is always set to a particular value (or left uninitialized), that affects whether the computation and subsequent branch in metal_virt2phys are reachable or well-defined.\n\n- pagemap entry format / macros that interpret entry bits: metal_virt2phys checks (entry >> 62) != 2 and uses bits (entry & ((1ULL << 54) - 1)). To decide whether the \"page present and not swapped\" branch can ever be taken or is effectively unreachable, you need the definition/specification or project macros that document how the pagemap entry is encoded on the target system. Without that, you cannot conclude whether that conditional is ever true or false for valid reads.\n\n- pread (declaration/semantics): metal_virt2phys relies on pread to fill entry and uses its return value to detect errors. To determine reachability of subsequent code (e.g., whether entry is valid when pread returns 0 or a short read), you must know pread's exact return semantics and how the project expects to handle short reads or EOF for the pagemap file.\n\nNotes: standard errno macros (EINVAL, ENOENT), metal_log/strerror usage, and integer typedefs (off_t, uint64_t, uintptr_t) do not affect branch reachability decisions themselves; the critical missing symbols are the ones that establish the possible runtime values of _metal fields, the interpretation of the pagemap entry bits, and the caller/init code that creates the calling context."
