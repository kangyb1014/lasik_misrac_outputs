  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_shmem_register_generic code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/90.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_shmem_register_generic as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_register_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_register_generic(struct metal_generic_shmem *shmem)\n{\n\t/* Make sure that we can be found. */\n\tmetal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0);\n\n\t/* Statically registered shmem regions cannot have a destructor. */\n\tmetal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close);\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list,\n\t\t\t    &shmem->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_shmem_register_generic:\n#define metal_assert(cond) metal_sys_assert(cond)\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above metal_shmem_register_generic code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. In the provided code each executed operation has an observable effect: metal_assert (defined as metal_sys_assert) performs a runtime check (possibly aborting or logging), metal_list_add_tail modifies the global list state, and removal of any of these operations would change program behaviour. Therefore the function does not contain dead code. (Note: if metal_sys_assert were replaced/compiled as a no-op such that the assert calls had no effect at runtime, then those assert calls would constitute dead code \u2014 but with the given definition this is not the case.)",
