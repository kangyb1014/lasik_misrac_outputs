  "explanation": "To decide whether pointer types in metal_shmem_register_generic should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule you must know the exact types and how they are used:\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem: Required to know the declared type of shmem itself and, critically, the declared type of the 'name' and 'node' fields. If 'name' is declared as 'char *' vs 'const char *' changes whether it should have been const-qualified. Also 'node' type determines whether the function is effectively modifying the object pointed to by shmem by passing &shmem->node.\n\n- ops structure containing 'close': You must see the type/signature of ops.close to determine whether checking/shmem->io.ops.close interacts with constness of any pointer members (and whether the close pointer itself is const-qualified). This clarifies whether the code merely reads a function pointer or needs a non-const pointer.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail prototype: The MISRA question hinges on whether metal_shmem_register_generic modifies the object reachable through the shmem pointer. Passing &shmem->node to metal_list_add_tail may cause modification; the callee's parameter types (const vs non-const) and whether it mutates the node/list are required to decide if 'shmem' or its 'node' field must be non-const.\n\n- list types (struct metal_list / struct metal_list_node): Knowing the concrete types used for 'generic_shmem_list' and 'node' lets you see whether metal_list_add_tail requires writable nodes/list and whether taking &shmem->node permits mutation of shmem subobject.\n\n- global _metal (.common.generic_shmem_list) type: You need the exact type of generic_shmem_list to match it against the metal_list_add_tail parameter types and to see whether passing that list interacts with constness constraints.\n\n- strlen prototype: Confirms that strlen accepts a 'const char *' (i.e. it only reads the string). If shmem->name is non-const but only passed to strlen, that is evidence it could have been declared const. Including strlen removes ambiguity about whether reading 'name' requires non-const.\n\nTogether these symbols let an analyst determine which pointers are actually modified (directly or via callees) and therefore whether any pointer should be const-qualified or must remain non-const to satisfy MISRA."
