  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_shmem_register_generic code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/91.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_shmem_register_generic as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_register_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_register_generic(struct metal_generic_shmem *shmem)\n{\n\t/* Make sure that we can be found. */\n\tmetal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0);\n\n\t/* Statically registered shmem regions cannot have a destructor. */\n\tmetal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close);\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list,\n\t\t\t    &shmem->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_shmem_register_generic code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The function passes &shmem->node to metal_list_add_tail which will modify the node fields inside the structure (linking it into the global list). Because the pointed-at object (shmem->node) is mutated, the pointer parameter must not be const. The other uses of shmem (reading name and ops.close) are non-mutating checks. Therefore the pointer type is correctly non-const and Rule 8.13 is not violated.",
