  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_shmem_register_generic code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/93.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_shmem_register_generic as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_register_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_register_generic(struct metal_generic_shmem *shmem)\n{\n\t/* Make sure that we can be found. */\n\tmetal_assert(shmem->name && strlen(shmem->name) != 0);\n\n\t/* Statically registered shmem regions cannot have a destructor. */\n\tmetal_assert(!shmem->io.ops.close);\n\n\tmetal_list_add_tail(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list,\n\t\t\t    &shmem->node);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_shmem_register_generic code violates the rule 17.8 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "metal_shmem_register_generic reads fields of the pointer parameter (shmem->name, shmem->io.ops.close) and passes the address of a member (&shmem->node) to metal_list_add_tail, but it does not assign to or otherwise modify the pointer parameter 'shmem' itself. Only the object pointed to may be manipulated via its members, which is permitted by the rule. Therefore no violation occurs.",
