  "explanation": "To decide if passing 'const char *path' violates the MISRA const-pointer rule we must know whether any callee could modify the bytes pointed to by path. metal_open only uses strlen(path) and passes path to either open or shm_open. Therefore we need the function prototypes/definitions of: \n- strlen: to confirm it takes a const char * and does not modify the string (so its use is safe with const).\n- open: to confirm the pathname parameter is declared as const char * and that open does not modify the supplied pathname.\n- shm_open: to confirm the name parameter is declared as const char * and that shm_open does not modify the supplied name.\nIf these symbols show the parameters are const-qualified (and the functions do not modify the buffer), the use of const char *path in metal_open complies with the MISRA rule. If any of these symbols accept a non-const pointer or documentation/implementation shows they modify the buffer, that would indicate a potential MISRA violation."
