  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 2.2 is: A project shall not contain dead code.\nAny operation that is executed but whose removal would not affect program behaviour constitutes dead code. Notes:\n1. The behaviour of an embedded sytem is often determined not just by the nature of its actions, but also by the time at which they occur.\n2. unreachable code is not dead code, as it cannot be executed.\n3.Initialization is not the same as an assignment operation and is therfore not a candidate for dead code.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_device_open code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/50.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_device_open as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_device_open:\n```c\nint metal_device_open(const char *bus_name, const char *dev_name,\n\t\t      struct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\tint error;\n\n\tif (!bus_name || !strlen(bus_name) ||\n\t    !dev_name || !strlen(dev_name) ||\n\t    !device)\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\n\terror = metal_bus_find(bus_name, &bus);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\tif (!bus->ops.dev_open)\n\t\treturn -ENODEV;\n\n\terror = (*bus->ops.dev_open)(bus, dev_name, device);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_device_open code violates the rule 2.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: metal_device_open contains no dead code. Every executed operation affects program behaviour: the input validation (including strlen checks) determines error return for invalid inputs, metal_bus_find affects control flow by returning errors or supplying the bus, the dev_open presence check governs whether -ENODEV is returned, and the call to (*bus->ops.dev_open) performs the device-specific open and its return value is propagated. There is no operation in the function that could be removed without changing behaviour.",
