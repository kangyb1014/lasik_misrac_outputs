  "explanation": "- strlen: The target calls strlen(bus_name) and strlen(dev_name). To assess MISRA string-boundary violations you must know the exact semantic/implementation assumptions of strlen (it reads until a NUL byte), so you can determine whether calling strlen on the provided pointers can read beyond their allocated bounds if they are not guaranteed NUL-terminated.\n- metal_bus_find: Although strlen is used before this call, metal_bus_find returns/initializes the bus that is later used to call bus->ops.dev_open. The behavior of metal_bus_find (especially whether it can modify inputs or affect lifetime/validity of dev_name/bus_name) and its error/return contract are relevant for full analysis.\n- struct metal_bus: You need the definition to locate the ops member and to understand layout/typing and whether accesses to bus->ops are well-formed.\n- struct metal_bus_ops (the type of bus->ops): To know what members exist (in particular dev_open) and their types so you can reason about the dev_open call and whether it may perform further string handling on dev_name that could cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n- bus->ops.dev_open prototype (the dev_open function signature): You must inspect the exact prototype and contract of dev_open (parameter types, whether it expects NUL-terminated strings, whether it copies or reads dev_name) because even though strlen checks were done in the wrapper, dev_open itself may invoke string.h functions on dev_name and could trigger MISRA violations if dev_name is not guaranteed safe by callers.\n- callers of metal_device_open (call sites that supply bus_name and dev_name): The safety of calling strlen on bus_name/dev_name depends on how those pointers are constructed/passed by callers. To decide if strlen may read out-of-bounds you need the call sites (and any upstream allocation/initialization) to verify that the char buffers are NUL-terminated and of sufficient size.\n\nThese symbols together let an analyzer determine (1) whether strlen is used on pointers that are guaranteed NUL-terminated and in-bounds, and (2) whether subsequent dev_open calls might invoke additional string functions that could access beyond buffer bounds."
