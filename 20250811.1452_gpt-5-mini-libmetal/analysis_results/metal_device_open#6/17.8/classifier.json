  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 17.8 is: A function parameter should not be modified.\nNote that the object referred to by a pointer parameter may be modified, but the pointer itself shall not be modified.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_device_open code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/53.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_device_open as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_device_open:\n```c\nint metal_device_open(const char *bus_name, const char *dev_name,\n\t\t      struct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct metal_bus *bus;\n\tint error;\n\n\tif (!bus_name || !strlen(bus_name) ||\n\t    !dev_name || !strlen(dev_name) ||\n\t    !device)\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\n\terror = metal_bus_find(bus_name, &bus);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\tif (!bus->ops.dev_open)\n\t\treturn -ENODEV;\n\n\terror = (*bus->ops.dev_open)(bus, dev_name, device);\n\tif (error)\n\t\treturn error;\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\nJudge whether the above metal_device_open code violates the rule 17.8 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation: metal_device_open does not modify any function parameter. The function only reads bus_name and dev_name (they are const) and passes the pointer parameter 'device' unchanged to bus->ops.dev_open. Modifying the object pointed to (*device) is allowed; modifying the pointer parameter itself (for example, assigning device = NULL or device = some_other_ptr) would violate Rule 17.8, but no such assignment occurs here.",
