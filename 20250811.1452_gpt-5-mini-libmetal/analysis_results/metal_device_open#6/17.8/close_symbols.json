  "explanation": "For checking the MISRA rule \u201ca function parameter shall not be modified\u201d we must be able to prove that metal_device_open does not change the pointer parameters (bus_name, dev_name, device). The listed symbols are needed for this reasoning:\n\n- metal_bus_find (prototype/signature): to know the parameter types of the call metal_bus_find(bus_name, &bus). If metal_bus_find accepted a non-const char * or required an implicit cast that could indicate an unsafe conversion or hidden modification risk; the prototype shows whether the call is type-safe and whether bus_name could be modified by that call signature (note: modification inside callee does not change the caller's parameter variable, but mismatched types or casts are relevant to MISRA analysis).\n\n- struct metal_bus (definition): to inspect the ops field and its dev_open member type. We must ensure bus->ops.dev_open is a function pointer and understand its expected parameter types so we can reason about what is being passed (particularly the device argument) and confirm metal_device_open itself does not assign to its pointer parameters.\n\n- type/signature of bus->ops.dev_open (function\u2011pointer type): to confirm the exact parameter types (e.g., whether it expects const char * for dev_name and struct metal_device ** for device). This lets us confirm that passing device (a struct metal_device **) is type-consistent and that any modification to *device by the callee is allowed by MISRA (modifying the pointee is permitted) while reassignment of the device parameter in metal_device_open would be a violation (and must be absent).\n\n- struct metal_device (declaration): to know the indirection level (that device is a pointer-to-pointer to a device object). This clarifies that modifying *device (the object pointed to) is permitted by the rule, whereas modifying the device pointer itself would violate it.\n\n- strlen (prototype): to show strlen takes const char * and does not modify the pointer argument; this supports the conclusion that using strlen(bus_name) and strlen(dev_name) does not modify the pointer parameters.\n\nI have omitted EINVAL and ENODEV from required symbols because those are error-code macros that do not affect whether function parameters are modified; they are irrelevant to this particular MISRA rule check."
