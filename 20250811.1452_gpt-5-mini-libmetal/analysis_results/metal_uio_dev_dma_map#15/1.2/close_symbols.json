  "explanation": "- struct metal_sg: required to know the exact types of the members used (sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len). If virt is void* then the expressions vaddr_sg_lo + sg_in[i].len perform pointer arithmetic on void*, which is a known compiler extension (e.g. GCC treats void* arithmetic as char*). The len type also affects whether the addition is standard pointer+integer.\n- struct metal_io_region: required to know the types of io->virt and io->size. That determines if vaddr_lo is a void* (same extension concern) and whether vaddr_lo + io->size is standard or an extension, and whether pointer comparisons are between compatible pointer types.\n- struct linux_device (including nested device member): required to determine the exact type of device.regions and device.num_regions and the element type of regions. If regions does not point to objects of the types assumed above, pointer operations/comparisons may involve incompatible pointer types or implicit casts that could rely on extensions.\n- metal_log (function or macro): the logging facility could itself be implemented as a compiler extension (e.g. using statement-expressions, non-standard variadic macros, or other compiler-specific constructs). To ensure no language extensions are used in the call site, the definition must be checked.\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING: the macro/value used with metal_log should be checked to ensure it is a simple constant/enum and not a macro that relies on extensions.\n- memcpy (declaration): verify that memcpy is properly declared (not relying on implicit function declarations, which some compilers permit as an extension) and that built-ins/inline implementations are not using compiler-specific extensions.\n- EINVAL: check definition/source of the error macro to confirm it is a standard errno macro and not replaced by an extension-specific construct.\n\nThese symbols supply the necessary type and macro/function definitions to determine whether any usage in the function (notably pointer arithmetic on virt members, pointer comparisons, logging/macro calls, and library calls) depends on language/compiler extensions."
