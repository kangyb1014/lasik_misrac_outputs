A pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "To determine whether pointers in metal_uio_dev_dma_map should be const-qualified under the MISRA rule you must know the exact types and const-ness of the fields used and the semantics of called functions:\n\n- struct metal_sg: The function reads sg_in[i].virt and sg_in[i].len and never writes into sg_in elements. The analysis needs the definition of struct metal_sg to know the declared type of 'virt' (e.g. void * vs const void * or char *) and the type of 'len' to decide whether sg_in could/should be declared as pointer-to-const (const struct metal_sg *). The pointer element type determines whether pointer arithmetic in the function is legal and whether the pointer itself should be const-qualified.\n\n- struct metal_io_region: The code reads io->virt and io->size and compares ranges against sg_in[].virt. You must know whether metal_io_region.virt is a const-qualified pointer (e.g. const void *) or not; if regions store const pointers then comparing against a non-const pointer from sg_in may indicate sg_in->virt should be const. Also the element type of virt affects pointer arithmetic semantics.\n\n- struct linux_device (including the nested 'device' member: regions and num_regions): The code accesses ldev->device.regions and ldev->device.num_regions and indexes regions. You need the exact types for 'regions' (pointer-to-metal_io_region or pointer-to-const-metal_io_region) and 'num_regions' to determine whether comparing/assigning pointers mixes const and non-const pointers and whether the regions array requires const qualification that would imply sg_in pointers should also be const.\n\n- memcpy (prototype): The function uses memcpy(sg_out, sg_in, ...). memcpy's signature (src is const void *) is central: it shows that copying from sg_in does not require sg_in to be non-const. If memcpy accepts a const source, sg_in could be const-qualified in this function. Having the prototype confirms that the function does not modify sg_in via memcpy, which is important to decide if sg_in should be const.\n\n(Other symbols in the function such as metal_log, METAL_LOG_WARNING, EINVAL, and dev_name are not required to assess pointer const-correctness for this MISRA rule.)"
