  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_shmem_open_generic code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/84.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_shmem_open_generic as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_shmem_open_generic:\n```c\nint metal_shmem_open_generic(const char *name, size_t size,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_io_region **result)\n{\n\tstruct metal_generic_shmem *shmem;\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_shmem_list, node) {\n\t\tshmem = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_generic_shmem, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(shmem->name, name) != 0)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\tif (size <= metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io)) {\n\t\t\t*result = &shmem->io;\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENOENT;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_shmem_open_generic:\n#define metal_list_for_each(list, node) for((node)=(list)->next;(node)!=(list);(node)=(node)->next)\n...\n#define metal_container_of(ptr, structure, member) (void*)((uintptr_t)(ptr)-metal_offset_of(structure,member))\n...\nstruct metal_list {\n\tstruct metal_list *next, *prev;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_generic_shmem {\n\tconst char\t\t*name;\n\tstruct metal_io_region\tio;\n\tstruct metal_list\tnode;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_io_region {\n\tvoid\t\t\t*virt;      /**< base virtual address */\n\tconst metal_phys_addr_t\t*physmap;   /**< table of base physical address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of each of the pages in the I/O\n\t\t\t\t\t\t region */\n\tsize_t\t\t\tsize;       /**< size of the I/O region */\n\tunsigned long\t\tpage_shift; /**< page shift of I/O region */\n\tmetal_phys_addr_t\tpage_mask;  /**< page mask of I/O region */\n\tunsigned int\t\tmem_flags;  /**< memory attribute of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I/O region */\n\tstruct metal_io_ops\tops;        /**< I/O region operations */\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above metal_shmem_open_generic code violates the rule 14.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "The for loop is generated by the metal_list_for_each macro which expands to: for ((node) = (list)->next; (node) != (list); (node) = (node)->next). The first clause initializes the single loop counter (node). The second clause tests only the loop counter against the list head (no persistent side-effects and no objects modified in the loop body). The third clause updates only the loop counter (node = node->next) and does not use objects modified in the loop body. The loop body does not modify the loop counter. Therefore the for loop is well-formed and does not violate MISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2.",
