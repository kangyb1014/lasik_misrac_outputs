The three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\nThe list will be included in the prompt for the next agent, so be concise and clear.\nExplain why each symbol is required in the analysis of the target function for the MISRA C rule.\n",

  "explanation": "Reason each symbol is required to check MISRA C 'for loop well-formed' rules:\n\n- metal_list_for_each\n  - This macro expands to the for-statement's three clauses (initialisation, condition, increment). To decide if the first clause defines/initialises the loop counter, the second clause has no persistent side effects and only uses the loop counter/flags, and the third clause modifies only the loop counter, you must examine the exact macro expansion.\n\n- metal_container_of\n  - Used inside the loop body to obtain the containing struct from the list node. You must confirm this macro has no side effects (it is typically pointer arithmetic) and does not modify the loop counter or other objects used in the for-clauses.\n\n- struct metal_list\n  - The for-macro almost certainly uses struct metal_list fields (e.g. next/prev). You need the field names/types to identify which object is the loop counter (typically the node pointer), and to verify the increment clause only modifies that loop counter and nothing else.\n\n- struct metal_generic_shmem\n  - The body assigns shmem = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_generic_shmem, node). To ensure the loop body does not modify the loop counter or other objects used in the for-clauses, you must know the layout and types of the fields accessed (node, name, io) and whether any body operations could alias or modify the list node.\n\n- _metal (or struct metal_common definition containing generic_shmem_list)\n  - The head passed to metal_list_for_each is &_metal.common.generic_shmem_list. You must inspect this symbol/type to understand the head object used by the for macro (it can affect the condition expression) and ensure no hidden side effects are involved.\n\n- struct metal_io_region\n  - The body uses &shmem->io and calls metal_io_region_size(&shmem->io). You need the type to reason about whether passing this object to the called function could modify list state or the loop counter (aliasing, side effects).\n\n- metal_io_region_size\n  - This function is invoked inside the loop body. MISRA treats the behaviour of called functions as part of the loop body; you must inspect its prototype/implementation to ensure it has no persistent side effects or modifications to the loop counter or to objects used in the for-clauses.\n\n- strcmp\n  - Called in the loop body to compare names. You must ensure the implementation/prototype guarantees no side effects that could modify the loop counter or any object used in the for-clauses.\n\nTogether these symbols let you expand the for macro into its three clauses, identify exactly which object is the loop counter, confirm there is only one loop counter, and verify that the condition has no persistent side effects and the increment clause modifies only the loop counter, and that no functions called in the loop body modify the loop counter or objects used by the loop control (as required by the MISRA rule)."
