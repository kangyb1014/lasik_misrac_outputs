  "explanation": "For each symbol below, why it is required to decide whether any part of metal_shmem_try_map is dead code (i.e. can be removed without changing program behaviour):\n\n- metal_align_up\n  - Determines the rounded 'size' used to compute 'pages'. Whether code that depends on pages (allocation, loop) is ever executed depends on this function's behaviour. Removal could change page count and reachability.\n\n- struct metal_page_size (fields: page_size, mmap_flags, page_shift)\n  - The function reads ps->page_size, ps->mmap_flags and ps->page_shift. Their values determine control flow (pages, offset arithmetic, mmap flags passed to metal_map, and the value given to metal_io_init). To assess whether branches/loops are effectively dead you must know how these fields are set/used.\n\n- metal_map\n  - Controls the initial early-return path on error and provides the 'mem' pointer on success. The observable behaviour of the function (and callers) changes if metal_map has side effects (e.g. modifying fd state) or always/never fails; thus its semantics are required to determine if subsequent code is ever executed or is removable.\n\n- metal_unmap\n  - Called on error paths to undo mapping. To decide if those cleanup calls are dead (i.e. removal wouldn't affect behaviour) you must know whether metal_unmap has side effects external to this function.\n\n- metal_log\n  - Multiple metal_log calls are present; to decide if logging calls are dead you must know whether metal_log has observable side effects beyond logging (timing, interacting with other subsystems). If metal_log affects system state or timing-critical behaviour, those calls are not dead.\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING\n  - The log level passed to metal_log; included because the logging path might be conditional on log level or macro expansion that changes behaviour.\n\n- strerror\n  - Used to render error messages from error codes. If its use has side effects (locale, thread-local state) or formatting changes behaviour, it matters for determining dead-ness of logging code.\n\n- mlock\n  - Called to lock pages in memory; this has clear side effects (prevents paging) and may alter program behaviour even if its return value is ignored. Whether the mlock call (and its error handling) is dead depends on mlock semantics in the environment.\n\n- errno\n  - The logged error string uses errno when mlock fails. errno's value and how it is set elsewhere affect log content and could reflect side effects; include it to understand the mlock error path.\n\n- malloc\n  - Used to allocate 'phys' and 'io'. If malloc always succeeds/fails or has side effects (out-of-memory handlers, heap corruption), that affects reachability of subsequent code and whether cleanup branches are dead.\n\n- free\n  - Used on error paths to release memory. To determine whether those frees are removable you must know if freeing has externally observable side effects in this environment.\n\n- _metal (global) and its pagemap_fd field\n  - The if-else which either sets phys[0] and uses offset-as-PA or iterates calling metal_virt2phys is gated by _metal.pagemap_fd < 0. Whether one branch is effectively always/never taken (making the other branch dead) depends on how and where pagemap_fd is initialized/changed elsewhere. You must inspect _metal and its initialization to decide dead-ness.\n\n- metal_virt2phys\n  - Used in the loop to populate phys[]. It can succeed/fail and may have side effects. If metal_virt2phys always fails or is never reachable (due to pagemap_fd), the loop could be dead. Its semantics determine whether the loop body is removable.\n\n- METAL_BAD_OFFSET\n  - Value written on failure of metal_virt2phys. Its meaning can affect downstream behaviour of the io region; removal of the assignment or the whole loop could change behaviour if downstream code relies on METAL_BAD_OFFSET. Include it to reason about observable effects.\n\n- metal_io_init\n  - Finalizes the io region; its implementation and side-effects determine whether the sequence of preparing 'phys' and 'mem' prior to calling metal_io_init is necessary. If metal_io_init internally ignores some inputs or always overwrites state, preparatory code might be dead; conversely, if it observes them, the preparatory code is live.\n\n- metal_shmem_io_ops\n  - The operation table passed into metal_io_init. Its identity may affect future behaviour of the io region and therefore whether different initialization branches are equivalent; needed to assess whether either branch (pagemap vs. offset) is removable.\n\n- struct metal_io_region (type/layout and metal_io_init semantics)\n  - The layout of metal_io_region and how metal_io_init uses/stores the provided mem/phys/shift/etc. determine whether earlier assignments/allocations are required. To decide whether any of this code is dead you must know what metal_io_init expects and what downstream code relies on in io.\n\nSummary: determining dead code in metal_shmem_try_map requires knowledge of the semantics and side-effects of the mapping/memory-management calls (metal_map, metal_unmap, mlock, malloc/free), the translation and io-init logic (_metal.pagemap_fd, metal_virt2phys, METAL_BAD_OFFSET, metal_io_init, metal_shmem_io_ops), and the logging/utility functions (metal_log, METAL_LOG_WARNING, strerror, errno, metal_align_up). Without these symbols and their semantics you cannot prove that branches/operations are unobservable and thus safe to remove."
