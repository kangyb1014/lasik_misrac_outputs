  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required:\n- strlen: The target calls strlen(device->name). To determine whether a forbidden use of memcmp is happening here you must inspect the actual strlen implementation/prototype used in the build (some libc/optimized variants could call low-level routines).\n- memcmp: The MISRA rule concerns use of memcmp for comparing null-terminated strings. Include memcmp so the analyzer can detect any direct or indirect use of memcmp in the target or its callees.\n- metal_list_add_tail: This is the only function called by the target (per the static call graph). Its implementation must be examined to ensure it does not use memcmp (or otherwise compare device->name as a null-terminated string using memcmp).\n- struct metal_device (definition: name, num_regions, node, bus): You must know the exact types/semantics of device->name (is it char * or something else, is it guaranteed null-terminated) and device->num_regions to understand whether string operations are being applied to a null-terminated string and to rule in/out memcmp misuse.\n- METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS: The constant is used in the conditional; include it so the analyzer can focus on the relevant branch and confirm no hidden string comparisons are tied to this value.\n- metal_generic_bus (definition): The function assigns device->bus = &metal_generic_bus; include its definition only to confirm that this assignment does not trigger any code paths (constructors, macros) that perform string comparisons using memcmp.\n- _metal (global) and _metal.common.generic_device_list (definition): These globals are used by metal_list_add_tail (list insertion). Include their definitions to check whether list insertion or any associated callbacks compare names using memcmp.\n- metal list node/list types and metal_list_add_tail implementation: Include the list node/list type definitions and the full implementation of metal_list_add_tail (and any functions/macros it calls) so the analyzer can verify no memcmp usage occurs in list handling or any helper routines.\n\nReasoning summary: to prove the target function does not violate the MISRA prohibition on using memcmp to compare null-terminated strings you must inspect any symbol that performs or can trigger string comparison on device->name. The list above covers direct calls (strlen), the direct callee (metal_list_add_tail) and all related data structures and globals whose code might perform such comparisons, plus the memcmp symbol itself to detect any occurrence."
