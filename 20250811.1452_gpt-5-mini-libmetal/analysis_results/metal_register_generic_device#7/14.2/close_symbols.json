Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause.

  "explanation": "Explain why each symbol is required for MISRA 'for loop shall be well-formed' analysis:\n\n- struct metal_device (definition): The target function accesses device->name, device->num_regions, device->bus and device->node. Knowing the exact types and semantics of these fields is required to determine whether any of them are or contain objects that could be used as loop counters or be modified inside for-loop bodies called from this function. Also needed to see whether any field access is a macro with hidden side-effects.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (function definition): This function is invoked from the target. MISRA requires that the behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that body. To determine whether any for-loop-related requirement could be violated (e.g. loop counter modified in called code, or the called code containing ill-formed for loops), you must inspect metal_list_add_tail for any for statements and for any modifications to objects that might be used as loop counters or flags in an enclosing for loop.\n\n- strlen (function definition / prototype): The target calls strlen(device->name) in the conditional. strlen implementations typically contain loops; to be certain that calling strlen does not itself contain ill-formed for loops (or persistent side-effects that would violate the second-clause rule when used inside a for conditional), inspect its definition or known implementation properties.\n\n- METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS (macro / constant): The macro/constant is used in the conditional comparison. If it is defined via a complex macro expression (rather than a pure compile-time constant), it might introduce side-effects or expressions that affect loop-well-formedness when similar expressions are used in for clauses. Confirming it is a simple constant is required.\n\n- metal_generic_bus (object definition): The function assigns device->bus = &metal_generic_bus. Understanding the type and any assignment side-effects (e.g. if this is a macro or an accessor) is necessary to rule out hidden side-effects that could interact with for-loop requirements in calling contexts.\n\n- _metal (object) and type of _metal.common.generic_device_list: The list head passed to metal_list_add_tail may be a complex macro or structure whose operations expand to code containing for loops. You must inspect its type and definitions to see whether list handling hides for loops or modifies objects relevant to loop counters or flags.\n\n- type/definition of device->node (list node type): metal_list_add_tail will operate on device->node. Knowing its type and whether its manipulation affects objects that might serve as loop counters (or whether node operations expand to macros containing for loops) is necessary to determine any indirect violations of the MISRA for-loop rules.\n\nNote: EINVAL and simple integer constants need not normally be inspected for for-loop well-formedness unless they are implemented as macros with side-effects; include them only if their definitions are non-trivial."
