  "explanation": "Explain why each is required to check for language-extension use:\n\n- struct metal_device (full definition): The function dereferences device and accesses fields (name, num_regions, node). You must inspect the struct definition to ensure those field declarations do not use compiler extensions (bit\u2011fields with non\u2011standard widths, compiler-specific attributes, anonymous structs/unions as an extension, or other non\u2011standard constructs).\n\n- METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS (macro/definition): The comparison uses this macro. Macros can expand to complex expressions using compiler extensions (statement expressions, typeof, asm, attribute syntax). You must see its definition to detect any non\u2011standard language constructs.\n\n- metal_generic_bus (object definition): The code takes the address of this symbol and assigns it to device->bus. Its declaration/definition could use non\u2011standard attributes or extension syntax (e.g., section attributes, asm labels, or extension types) that would make the function indirectly use an extension.\n\n- _metal (object/variable definition and type containing .common.generic_device_list): The expression &_metal.common.generic_device_list depends on the type and definition of _metal and its nested members. Inspecting the definition detects anonymous/extension members, compound literals, or macros that expand to extension constructs.\n\n- metal_list_add_tail (declaration/definition and any macros it expands to): The call site appears normal, but the symbol may be a macro or inline function implemented with GNU extensions (statement expressions, typeof, nested functions, asm, attributes). You must examine its implementation and any helper macros it uses to determine whether the call introduces language extensions.\n\n- strlen (declaration/prototype): strlen is a standard library function; include its declaration to confirm the code uses the standard prototype rather than a platform header that redefines it with extensions (or a macro wrapper that uses extensions).\n\n- EINVAL (macro/definition): The function returns -EINVAL. Inspecting EINVAL's definition (from errno.h or project headers) ensures it is a plain macro/enum and not defined using extension constructs.\n\nIn short, any identifier that is a macro, object, or type referenced by the function must be examined because macros/definitions can hide compiler-specific language extensions even though the function source looks standard. The items above are the minimal set needed to decide whether this function uses any compiler-documented language extensions."
