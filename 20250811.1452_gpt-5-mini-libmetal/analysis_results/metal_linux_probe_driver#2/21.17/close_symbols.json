  "explanation": "1) struct linux_driver: Needed to know the types and storage for mod_name and drv_name (char array vs char * and their allocated sizes). If mod_name or drv_name are not nul-terminated or are shorter/incorrectly sized, snprintf(\"%s\") or any string handling reading them can read beyond their bounds. 2) struct linux_bus: Needed to know the type/size of bus_name for the same reason: sysfs_open_driver is passed bus_name and may use string.h functions that could read it. 3) sysfs_open_driver: Its implementation tells whether it calls standard <string.h> functions (strlen, strcpy, strcmp, etc.) on drv_name or bus_name and whether it assumes nul-termination; this determines possible out-of-bounds reads. 4) snprintf: Although declared in <stdio.h>, snprintf reads the source strings specified by %s; understanding its exact reading behavior (it reads until the first '\\0') is necessary to assess whether it can read past the source buffer when given a non-nul-terminated string. 5\u20137) Initializers/constructors that populate ldrv->mod_name, ldrv->drv_name, and lbus->bus_name: To know whether those strings are written in a way that guarantees nul-termination and within-bounds storage (e.g., size-limited strncpy usage, heap allocation, or pointer aliases). If any code that sets those fields can produce unterminated or undersized buffers, then the %s conversions and any string.h usage elsewhere can cause out-of-bounds reads. These symbols collectively let an analyzer determine whether any string-handling operations in or called by metal_linux_probe_driver can read beyond object bounds, which is what the MISRA rule enforces."
