  "explanation": "To decide whether parts of metal_linux_probe_driver are dead code (i.e., can be removed without changing program behaviour) the next analyst needs the following symbols and why:\n\n- sysfs_open_driver\n  - Determines when/if ldrv->sdrv becomes non-NULL and whether repeated calls after attempting modprobe can change behaviour. If sysfs_open_driver can succeed after modprobe/system calls, the probing branches are not dead.\n\n- system\n  - Its return semantics and side-effects (invoking shell commands that can load kernel modules) are central: calling system(\"modprobe ...\") may change system state so removal would change behaviour. Need its definition/usage policy in this codebase.\n\n- snprintf\n  - The code checks snprintf's return against sizeof(command) to detect truncation and return -EOVERFLOW. Correct interpretation of snprintf behaviour is required to know whether the overflow branch can be taken (and thus whether that early return is reachable/affects behaviour).\n\n- metal_log\n  - Logging may be considered an observable side-effect. To know if removing the error-reporting calls would change behaviour, we must know whether metal_log has side-effects beyond printing (e.g., state changes, callbacks).\n\n- METAL_LOG_WARNING\n  - The logging severity/macro may influence metal_log behaviour; include to determine whether those calls are relevant/observable.\n\n- struct linux_driver (fields: sdrv, drv_name, mod_name)\n  - Types and initialisation/state of these fields determine reachability/impact of the branches. For example, where and how sdrv is initialised, whether drv_name/mod_name are valid strings, and whether sdrv is used elsewhere affect whether the probe/fallbacks are necessary.\n\n- struct linux_bus (field: bus_name)\n  - Needed because sysfs_open_driver is invoked with lbus->bus_name; bus_name validity affects sysfs_open_driver outcome and thus branch reachability.\n\n- EOVERFLOW and ENODEV\n  - The function returns these error codes. To reason whether the overflow or final -ENODEV return is ever produced (or is redundant), the actual values and usage in the surrounding codebase are necessary.\n\n- metal_linux_probe_bus\n  - This function is the direct caller of metal_linux_probe_driver. To determine whether probe_driver is ever invoked (making it potentially whole-function dead code) we must inspect the caller and the call conditions.\n\n- metal_linux_bus_init\n  - It calls metal_linux_probe_bus (per the static call graph). To establish whether the whole call chain that reaches probe_driver is used at runtime (and thus whether probe_driver or parts of it are dead), the higher-level init path must be examined.\n\nNote: I omitted standard compile-time macros like __func__ (no runtime side-effect) and basic C library semantics beyond snprintf/system because they are implicit; include them only if the project overrides/ wraps them. The listed symbols are the minimal set required to determine whether the probing branches, overflow check, logging calls, and final error return are reachable and observable (i.e., not dead code)."
