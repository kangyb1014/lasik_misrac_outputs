  "explanation": "Include the following symbols so the next agent can determine whether any memcmp use reachable from metal_linux_probe_driver compares null-terminated strings:\n\n- sysfs_open_driver: Called three times by the target. Any use of memcmp inside this function (or functions it calls) could be a MISRA violation reachable from the target; the agent must inspect its implementation/signature and how it handles driver name strings.\n\n- snprintf: Called to format shell commands that include ldrv->mod_name. While snprintf itself does not use memcmp, the formatted strings and their sources may affect whether string comparisons elsewhere are performed on null-terminated strings; also inspect snprintf usage to ensure no indirect memcmp on buffers.\n\n- system: Called to invoke shell commands. The implementation could call library code that uses memcmp; include it to inspect any reachable memcmp usage (and to ensure no string comparisons of the formatted command are performed by callers).\n\n- metal_log: Logging function called on error paths. If metal_log or its helpers use memcmp on null-terminated strings, that would be reachable; include it for inspection.\n\n- memcmp: The Standard Library function under scrutiny. The agent should search for all uses of memcmp in the target, in the listed callees, and in their transitive callees to see if it is used to compare null-terminated strings.\n\n- struct linux_driver: The target accesses ldrv->drv_name, ldrv->mod_name, and ldrv->sdrv. The agent needs the struct definition to know the types/contract of these members (e.g., char * vs fixed arrays, whether they are guaranteed null-terminated) to judge whether any memcmp use would be comparing null-terminated strings.\n\n- struct linux_bus: The target accesses lbus->bus_name. The agent needs the struct definition to know the type/termination guarantees of bus_name and whether it could be involved in memcmp comparisons.\n\nNote: The target function itself contains no direct memcmp calls. The analysis must therefore inspect the implementations (and reachable transitive callees) of the listed functions and the definitions of the listed structs to determine if any memcmp usage compares null-terminated strings in a way that violates the MISRA rule."
