  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 8.13 is: A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible.\nA pointer should not point to a const-qualified type if the pointer is used by a function that modifies the object pointed to by the pointer.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_generic_dev_open code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/67.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_generic_dev_open as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_open:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_open(struct metal_bus *bus, const char *dev_name,\n\t\t\t   struct metal_device **device)\n{\n\tstruct metal_list *node;\n\tstruct metal_device *dev;\n\n\t(void)bus;\n\n\tmetal_list_for_each(&_metal.common.generic_device_list, node) {\n\t\tdev = metal_container_of(node, struct metal_device, node);\n\t\tif (strcmp(dev->name, dev_name) == 0) {\n\t\t\t*device = dev;\n\t\t\treturn metal_generic_dev_sys_open(dev);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn -ENODEV;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_open:\nstruct metal_device {\n\tconst char             *name;       /**< Device name */\n\tstruct metal_bus       *bus;        /**< Bus that contains device */\n\tunsigned int           num_regions; /**< Number of I/O regions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t device */\n\tstruct metal_io_region regions[METAL_MAX_DEVICE_REGIONS]; /**< Array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI/O regions in device*/\n\tstruct metal_list      node;       /**< Node on bus' list of devices */\n\tint                    irq_num;    /**< Number of IRQs per device */\n\tvoid                   *irq_info;  /**< IRQ ID */\n}\n...\nint metal_generic_dev_sys_open(struct metal_device *dev)\n{\n\t(void)dev;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n...\nstruct metal_list {\n\tstruct metal_list *next, *prev;\n}\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above metal_generic_dev_open code violates the rule 8.13 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "Not violated. The function returns a modifiable struct metal_device * via the out-parameter and passes that pointer to metal_generic_dev_sys_open which is declared to take a non-const struct metal_device * (and thus may modify the device). Because the pointer is used by a function that could modify the pointed-to object, it must not be changed to point to a const-qualified type. Also dev->name is already const char * and dev is only examined with strcmp, so const usage is appropriate elsewhere.",
