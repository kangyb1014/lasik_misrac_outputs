  "explanation": "To determine whether the target function uses any compiler language extensions you must inspect any macros, types and globals expanded or referenced in the function body (these are common places extensions hide):\n\n- metal_container_of (macro definition): container_of-style macros frequently use GCC extensions such as typeof(), statement-expressions ({ ... }) or cast tricks. You must see the macro expansion to detect any non-standard language constructs.\n\n- metal_list_for_each (macro definition): iteration macros sometimes embed compiler-specific extensions (e.g. typeof for loop variables). The macro definition is needed to check for such extensions.\n\n- struct metal_device (type definition): the macro expansions (container_of) and member accesses (dev->name, dev->node) depend on the layout and member types; also the struct definition might itself use extensions (bit-fields with non-standard types, unnamed members, flexible array members, attributes, etc.).\n\n- struct metal_list (type definition): the loop variable 'node' is of this type; its definition may reveal use of extensions (e.g. anonymous structs/unions, attributes) and is needed to validate macro expansions.\n\n- _metal (global variable / its type and definition): the code reads _metal.common.generic_device_list. The definition/type of _metal (and of its member common) could use designated initializers, anonymous unions/structs or attributes which are language extensions; inspect the symbol to detect such usage.\n\n- metal_generic_dev_sys_open (prototype/definition): the call expression uses this symbol\u2019s declaration; the function prototype or its attributes might use compiler extensions (attributes, non-standard calling conventions) that influence whether the target function relies on extensions.\n\n- ENODEV (macro definition): although typically standard, check its definition to ensure it is a simple integer macro and not implemented via any non-standard construct.\n\n- strcmp (declaration / header include): standard library function; include its declaration to confirm no non-standard replacement or macro is in use (e.g. a project-local macro or wrapper using extensions).\n\nInspecting these symbols lets the next analyzer expand macros and inspect type and global definitions to detect any use of language/compiler extensions (typeof, statement-expressions, __attribute__, inline asm, anonymous structs/unions, etc.) that would violate the MISRA rule."
