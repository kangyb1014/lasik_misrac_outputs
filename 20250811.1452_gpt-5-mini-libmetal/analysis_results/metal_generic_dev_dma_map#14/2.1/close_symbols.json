  "explanation": "Why each symbol is needed for unreachable-code (MISRA) analysis:\n\n- METAL_DMA_DEV_W: The if-statement (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) controls whether metal_cache_flush is executed. To decide if that branch is ever/never taken (hence whether code is unreachable) you must know the constant value/definition of METAL_DMA_DEV_W and whether it can match runtime dir values passed by callers.\n\n- metal_cache_flush: Its definition (or macro expansion) is required because it may be conditionally compiled out or be a no-op macro; knowing that determines whether the call constitutes real reachable code after preprocessing or can disappear, which affects reachability analysis.\n\n- metal_cache_invalidate: Same reason as metal_cache_flush \u2014 its definition or macro expansion and conditional compilation may affect whether the call remains in the compiled code and thus whether the statements in the loop are reachable.\n\n- callers of metal_generic_dev_dma_map (all project references): If the function has no callers anywhere in the project (or only called under unreachable build configurations), the whole function body would be unreachable (dead code). You need the project-wide call/usage information to determine that.\n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): The loop and calls index sg_out[i] and use sg_out[i].virt/len. Knowing the struct layout is needed to understand whether these accesses are meaningful and whether any compile-time attributes on these fields (e.g. if they are macros, inline consts, or otherwise) affect reachability after preprocessing/optimization.\n\n- memcpy (declaration/definition): memcpy might be a macro, inline, or conditionally defined; its presence/expansion can affect whether the sg_out!=sg_in branch compiles to code. Knowing its definition helps determine if that branch produces reachable code.\n\n- configuration macros that affect metal_cache_* (e.g. cache enable/disable macros): Platform/build configuration macros can make cache functions no-ops or remove them via conditional compilation. Those build-time symbols are necessary to determine whether code inside the loop is actually emitted for a given build (affecting reachability).\n\n(Only these symbols influence whether branches/statements in this function can be eliminated or the entire function can be dead; other symbols like struct metal_bus or struct metal_device are cast to void and do not affect reachability.)"
