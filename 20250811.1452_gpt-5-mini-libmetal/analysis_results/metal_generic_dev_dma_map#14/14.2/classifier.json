  "user_message": "<misra_rule>\nMISRA C 2023 Rule 14.2 is: A for loop shall be well-formed.\nThe three clauses of a for statement are the:\n1. First clause shall be empty or an expression whose set the value of the loop counter or define and intialize the loop counter.\n2. Second clause shall be an expression that has no persistent side effects, and shall use the loop count and optionally loop flags, and shall not use any other object that is modified in the for loop body.\n3.Third clause shall be an expression whose modify only the value of the loop counter, and shall not use objects that are modified in the for loop body.\n4. There shall only be one loop counter in a for loop, which shall not be modified in for loop body. A loop control flag is defined as single identifier denoting an object with essentially Boolean type that is used in the second clause. The behaviour of a for loop body includes the behaviour of any functions called within that statement.\n</misra_rule>\n<response format>\nProvide your answer with these fields.\n- is_rule_violated: whether the rule is violated or not (true/false),\n- scenario: a specific violation scenario.\n- test_code: a modified metal_generic_dev_dma_map code that contains useful probe functions that print useful logs to a file \"/tmp/logs/116.txt\". The logs should contain the control path and state information of the violation scenario. If the MISRA C rule is not violated, you can just return an empty string for the test code.\nHere are the constraints for the test code:\n- DO NOT introduce new violations to demonstrate your scenario.\n- The test code MUST be compilable and executable.\n- The test code MUST include line breaks.\n- The test code MUST preserve the original logic of metal_generic_dev_dma_map as much as possible.\n- You MUST NOT define the main function.\n- You MUST NOT define macros.\n- The test code MUST not contain any mock functions.\n</response format>\n<target_code>\nHere is the code of metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\n```c\nint metal_generic_dev_dma_map(struct metal_bus *bus,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_device *device,\n\t\t\t     uint32_t dir,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_in,\n\t\t\t     int nents_in,\n\t\t\t     struct metal_sg *sg_out)\n{\n\tint i;\n\t(void)bus;\n\t(void)device;\n\n\tif (sg_out != sg_in)\n\t\tmemcpy(sg_out, sg_in, nents_in*(sizeof(struct metal_sg)));\n\tfor (i = 0; i < nents_in; i++) {\n\t\tif (dir == METAL_DMA_DEV_W) {\n\t\t\tmetal_cache_flush(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t\t}\n\t\tmetal_cache_invalidate(sg_out[i].virt, sg_out[i].len);\n\t}\n\n\treturn nents_in;\n}\n```\n</target_code>\n<additional code>Here are the definitions of symbols that are close to the target function metal_generic_dev_dma_map:\nstruct metal_sg {\n\tvoid *virt; /**< CPU virtual address */\n\tstruct metal_io_region *io; /**< IO region */\n\tint len; /**< length */\n}\n...\n#define METAL_DMA_DEV_W 2\n</additional code>\nJudge whether the above metal_generic_dev_dma_map code violates the rule 14.2 or not.",
  "is_rule_violated": false,
  "scenario": "No violation. The for loop is well-formed: the init clause sets the single loop counter (i = 0); the condition uses only the loop counter and nents_in (i < nents_in) which is not modified in the loop body; the iteration expression (i++) modifies only the loop counter. No other objects used in the second or third clauses are modified inside the loop body, and the loop counter is not modified in the body. Therefore Rule 14.2 is not violated.",
