  "explanation": "To decide whether the memcpy call can access beyond the source or destination buffers you must know: \n\n- struct metal_sg (definition): the function copies nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg) bytes. You need the exact structure definition (fields and types) to compute sizeof(struct metal_sg) and to understand what memory is being copied (and later accessed via sg_out[i].virt/len). \n\n- memcpy prototype (from <string.h>) / size_t: memcpy's third argument is size_t and conversions/semantics matter. Knowing the prototype lets you reason about signed\u2192unsigned conversions and the maximum representable copy length.\n\n- Call sites / API contract that allocate or pass sg_in and sg_out: the key question is whether sg_in and sg_out actually point to arrays with at least nents_in elements. That information exists in the callers or in the documented contract for metal_generic_dev_dma_map; without it you cannot prove the memcpy size is bounded by the actual buffer sizes.\n\n- nents_in parameter constraints / validation: you must know allowed ranges (e.g., guaranteed non\u2011negative, upper bound) or whether the caller can pass negative or very large values. This affects correctness (negative int converted to large unsigned size_t) and whether the multiplication can overflow.\n\n- Platform integer and size limits (sizeof(size_t), SIZE_MAX, INT_MAX): to detect possible integer overflow in the multiplication nents_in * sizeof(struct metal_sg) and to reason about wrap/unsigned conversion that could cause memcpy to be called with a length larger than the real buffers.\n\n(With these symbols/artefacts you can determine whether the computed byte count passed to memcpy is provably <= the actual source/destination buffer sizes and hence whether the use of memcpy could violate the MISRA rule.)"
